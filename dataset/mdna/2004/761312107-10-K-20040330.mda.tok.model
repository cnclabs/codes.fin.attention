the senior notes required semi annual interest payments every november st and may st and sinking fund payments of million on may  and million on may  since november   we were unable to make the required semi annual interest payments or the sinking fund payments due may  and as a result  an event of default  as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes  had existed since december  as we were not able to make the november  semi annual interest payment within the day cure period provided for in the indenture 
in november  we solicited the consent of our noteholders to certain provisions and waivers of the indenture governing the senior notes in an effort to facilitate the refinancing 
the significant provisions of the solicitation requested that the noteholders consent to permanently waive all then existing defaults under the indenture  cancel all accrued and unpaid interest  cancel of the principal amount of senior notes and extend the maturity of the notes to december in order for the consent to be effective  we needed noteholders comprising at least of the principal amount of outstanding senior notes to consent

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations net sales  gross margins and ebitda percentages for and are as follows net sales gross margin ebitda pressure vessels and springs   cylinders   plastics   totals   pressure vessels and springs sales were up in compared to this increase is due to this segment s return to almost normal production and shipment levels during the first half of compared to management s decision to shut down our pressure vessels facility for the first two months of with a limited production schedule 
we made this decision in to reduce spending due to our liquidity problems and to lessen the strain on this segment s raw material vendors 
this segment s backlog has increased since year end through february  including a increase in the pressure vessels product line 
based on an increased level of customer inquiries and quote activity  
the company believes this increase in order levels will be sustained into the second quarter of 
cylinder sales were flat for compared to due to weak fourth quarter shipments caused by temporary customer facility shutdowns and a resulting decrease in order levels 
this segment s backlog has increase since year end through february however  this segment continues to be affected by softness in its markets  
a trend which may continue during the decrease in plastics revenues in compared to began in the second quarter of and is the result of several reasons including our reduced ability to access raw materials  which was affected by tight liquidity  and a continued lag in certain customers decisions on newly quoted programs  which are intended to replace finished programs  caused by the uncertainty surrounding our current financial condition 
this segment s backlog has increased almost since year end through february due to the start of a few new customer programs 
however  
this segment may continue to be affected by an overall lag in new program starts 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the pressure vessel and springs segment in compared to is primarily due to increased sales and to management s decision to shut down our pressure vessels facility for the first two months of as discussed above  resulting in a reduction in production activity for the second quarter causing underabsorption of overheads and a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales than would normally be expected 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales at cylinders is the result of actions to reduce costs through workforce reductions taken in the third quarter to better match production resources with volume levels 
although the same actions to reduce costs were also taken at plastics  the benefits were more than offset by the decreased volume level and the resulting effect of fixed costs on gross margin 
management evaluates the company s segments based on ebitda  a measure of cash generation  which is presented  not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt and due to the close relationship it bears to reunion s financial covenants in its borrowing agreements 
ebitda and ebitda as a percentage of sales increased during compared to primarily due to the same factors affecting gross profit margin discussed above and our continued focus on reducing selling  general and administrative costs in plastics 
a reconciliation of ebitda to operating income loss in and by segment and corporate and other is as follows s operating profit deprec amortiz loss iation ation ebitda pressure vessels and springs   cylinders plastics   corporate and other   totals   pressure vessels and springs  cylinders plastics   corporate and other   totals   includes gains totaling  on sales of property and equipment 
excludes gain on debt extinguishment of  see gain on debt extinguishment below 
include gain of  on sale of equipment 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sga expenses for were million  compared to million for this decrease in sga is due to including approximately million of incremental legal  audit and consultant costs related to the default on our bank financing that did not recur in the remaining decrease is related to cost cutting measures taken during  including trimming the executive payroll and reductions in administrative positions 
sga as a percentage of sales decreased to for compared to in despite the decrease in sales  sga as a percentage of sales was lower in compared to due to lower incremental bank induced costs and previously described cost cutting measures 
gain on debt extinguishment in november  we solicited the consent of our noteholders to certain provisions and waivers of the indenture governing the senior notes in an effort to facilitate the refinancing 
the significant provisions of the solicitation requested that the noteholders consent to waive all then existing defaults under the indenture  cancel all accrued and unpaid interest  cancel of the principal amount of senior notes and extend the maturity of the notes to december in order for the consent to be effective  we needed noteholders comprising at least of the principal amount of outstanding senior notes to consent 
as of december   the end of the consent period   of the  principal amount of senior notes  or  had consented 
accordingly  of the  principal amount of senior notes of noteholders that had consented to the various provisions and waivers  or million  was extinguished pursuant to the provisions of the consent 
as of december   accrued and unpaid interest related to the senior notes totaled million  of which million related to the  principal amount of senior notes of noteholders that had consented to the various provisions and waivers 
such interest was extinguished pursuant to the provisions of the consent 
the remaining million of accrued and unpaid interest is included in accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  
the company is currently investigating other recapitalization scenarios that include  among other things  the use of additional private capital fund financing to repurchase at discounts with waivers of all accrued and unpaid interest some portion or all of our senior and unsecured suboridinated notes payable 
the company believes that  as the result of recent events related to our refinancing and senior notes and  in view of our continuing efforts to investigate other recapitalization scenarios  resulting gains from such activities do not meet the criteria pursuant to apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for classification as extraordinary 
other income other income for was  compared to other income of million for the components are as follows change gain on sale of property reduction of the lease termination reserve gain on sale of equipment provision for bad debt write off of assets other income  net total other income  net other income in includes gains on sales of idle farmland in boone county  il of  and excess manufacturing equipment of  we also adjusted the lease termination reserve  resulting in a reduction of  the lease termination reserve was reduced as the result of the execution of a sublease agreement with another party resulting in a new estimate of future lease termination costs 
we also provided for a bad debt from a customer in plastics that declared bankruptcy and wrote off assets of an inactive subsidiary deemed to have no value 
in january  we sold equipment that had no book value 
the decrease in the remaining other income is primarily due to higher levels of sales of scrap and miscellaneous parts in due to cleaning out idled facilities 
interest expense interest expense for was million compared to million for for  a total of million of interest expense has been allocated to or actually incurred in discontinued operations 
on a combined basis interest expense was million in average debt during was significantly less than levels due to pay downs with proceeds from asset sales in june and september also  in compared to  the company was paying a higher default rate on the boa revolving credit and term loan facilities and we paid  in amendment and overadvance fees to boa in these decreases from were partially offset by more than  in fees and costs charged to interest expense incurred during our continuing refinancing efforts during with other lenders 
income taxes there was no tax provision from continuing operations in or the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax return reporting purposes totaling million at december   million of which expire by the end of 
the company may be able to utilize its loss carryforwards against possible increased future profitability 
however  management has determined to fully reserve for the total amount of net deferred tax assets as of december  
and to continue to do so during until management can conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of our loss carryforwards can be utilized 
discontinued operations there was a loss from discontinued operations for of million compared to a loss from discontinued operations of million in the loss from discontinued operations of million in relates to an evaluation of legacy healthcare costs  which increased substantially in the third quarter of the adjustment in is to recognize these unanticipated healthcare costs  totaling million  which significantly exceeded the accrual for such costs established at year end 
such costs should decrease significantly in as the healthcare coverage benefit period for the former employees of our discontinued bridges and cranes operation provided by law in the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of ended at year end 
the remaining million loss from discontinued operations in represents legacy legal costs relating to litigation surrounding our discontinued bridges and cranes operations 
the loss from discontinued operations in relates to a million gain on disposal of the discontinued materials handling systems operations in september partially offset by a loss from its discontinued operations of million  which includes allocated interest expense of million  and a loss on disposal of the discontinued bridges and cranes operations of million  which includes allocated interest expense of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations net sales  gross margins and ebitda percentages for and are as follows 
net sales gross margin ebitda pressure vessels and springs   cylinders   plastics   totals   pressure vessels and springs sales were down significantly in compared to this decrease is due primarily to management s decision to shut down our pressure vessels facility during the first quarter of and also in july we made these decisions to reduce spending due to our liquidity problems and to lessen the strain on this segment s raw material vendors 
the decrease was also caused by the fact that the first quarter of included the recognition of million of revenues on a large nasa contract manufactured in but shipped in the first quarter of we have made significant progress in correcting vendor related issues with cash proceeds from asset sales resulting in greater raw material availability 
sales of cylinders in was affected by the temporary manufacturing disruption caused by the relocation of our former milwaukee  wi cylinder operations to libertyville  il and continues to be affected by a softness in this market 
the decrease in plastics revenues is the continuation of a downward trend which began in and resulted from several factors  including certain customers relocating manufacturing operations to mexico and asia  reduced customer orders for continuing programs  end of product cycles and delays in new program starts  which affected all plastics facilities 
plastics also lost a top ten customer in the second half of to competitive bidding on the internet 
management is seeking to expand plastics product offerings in the business machines  consumer products and medical products industries to mitigate this trend 
gross margins in were negatively affected by inventory charges of million at pressure vessels and springs  million at cylinders and  at plastics 
excluding these charges  the decreases in gross margins across all segments is related to volume declines resulting in a decrease in production activity and our inability to absorb costs 
we have responded to these conditions by completing our plan to restructure  including disposing of assets  combining certain operations and eliminating various administrative and management positions 
the benefits of these actions have only been partially realized to date 
management evaluates the company s segments based on ebitda  a measure of cash generation  which is presented  not as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  but because it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt and due to the close relationship it bears to reunion s financial covenants in its borrowing agreements

management estimates the savings from these reductions to be approximately million annually 
however  the benefits of these cost cutting measures are being more than offset by the continuation of the negative trend in sales and the resulting effect on the company s ability to absorb costs 
sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for compared to in sga as a percentage of sales was higher in compared to  which was due to the faster rate at which volume decreased compared to decreases in relatively fixed administrative costs

credit is extended after a credit review by management  which is based on a customer s ability to perform its obligations 
such reviews are regularly updated 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon agings of customer balances and specific account reviews by management 
reunion industries has no concentration of credit risks and generally does not require collateral or other security from its customers 
accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december   which represented and  respectively  of gross trade receivables excluding other non trade receivables 
inventories and inventory reserves at december   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  at costs that approximate the first in  first out method of inventory valuation 
during the third quarter of  for those locations of the company that had been using the last in  first out method of inventory valuation  we changed the method of valuing inventory to the first in  first out method 
the effect on the results of operations for the year ended december  was inconsequential 
approximately of total inventories at december  had been valued using the last in  first out method 
work in process and finished goods include material costs  labor costs and manufacturing overhead 
reserves for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on reviews of inventory usage reports for items more than one year old 
the company evaluates its inventories on a quarterly basis to identify excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories and assess reserve adequacy 
when this evaluation indicates such inventories exist  the reserve is increased by a charge to operations or such inventories are written off 
goodwill and impairment the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses is considered to be goodwill and  until december   was being amortized over years using the straight line method 
the company reviews goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we also review goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of reporting units to their fair value 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss 
reporting unit fair value is estimated using the income approach  which assumes that the value of a reporting unit can be computed as the present value of the assumed future returns of an enterprise discounted at a rate of return that reflects the risk of an investment 
a significant increase in the rate at which the assumed future returns are discounted could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a negative impact on our operating results 
at december   the company had million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet 
of the million of goodwill  million relates to the pressure vessels and springs segment and million relates to the cylinders segment 
we have completed all transitional and annual impairment tests necessary to date and concluded that our goodwill is not impaired 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the company makes contributions to the defined benefit plans based on the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of the company uses the fair value of plan assets to determine the expected and actual returns on plan assets 
the difference between the expected return and actual return is deferred 
during the second half of and the year  the fair value of assets in both of the company s defined benefit pension plans decreased for various reasons  including a downturn in the overall economy and unusual world events 
during  the fair value of assets increased but was mostly offset by an increase in the benefit obligation 
the company has recorded additional minimum pension liabilities in excess of amounts previously accrued totaling million  which is classified as accumulated comprehensive loss within stockholders deficit at both december  and although management believes the long term rates of return used to calculate the expected returns on plan assets are reasonable  a trend of actual returns being less than expected returns has developed such that future pension costs may continue to increase 
in determining the discount rates to be used at the end of each year to determine plan liabilities  the company looks at rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
changes in discount rates over the last three years have not materially affected pension costs and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas 
the company currently expects consolidated pension costs in will approximate 
other postretirement benefits the company provides health benefits for certain retired employees at the company s pressure vessel operations and plastics and of its corporate executive payroll 
these plans are not funded 
other postretirement benefit costs and the benefit obligation are actuarially determined based on discount rates and expected trends in healthcare costs 
recent experience has been less favorable during than the actuarial assumptions resulting in a deferral of costs 
as a result  
the company currently expects consolidated other postretirement benefit costs for to increase from 
stock based compensation the company has elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock options and awards

louisiana environmental in connection with the sale of its former oil and gas operations  pre merger reunion retained certain oil and gas properties in louisiana because of litigation concerning environmental matters 
the company is in the process of environmental remediation under a plan approved by the louisiana department of natural resources office of conservation ldnroc 
the company has recorded an accrual for its proportionate share of the remaining estimated costs to remediate the site based on plans and estimates developed by the environmental consultants hired by the company 
during  the company conducted remediation work on the property 
the company paid  of the total cost of  regulatory hearings were held in january and to consider the adequacy of the remediation conducted to date 
in august  ldnroc issued its order for the company to complete the soil remediation under the plan approved in and to perform additional testing to determine to what extent groundwater contamination might exist 
no remediation was performed in  or pending the decision 
however  the company has paid  for its share of consulting services in connection with the hearings 
most recently  the company s environmental consultants filed with the ldnroc updated amendments to the prior approved plan for sampling and remediation 
if approved  the plan will be implemented 
at december   after accruing an additional  in december  the balance accrued for these remediation costs is approximately  the company believes that future remediation costs will not exceed the amount accrued and will be funded by net production revenues of the producing wells on the property as part of the settlement agreement discussed below 
litigation on this matter had been stayed pending the determination by the ldnroc as to the extent of remediation that would be required 
such stay was lifted and the district court had established a jury trial for september  to determine the necessity for any further remediation and the extent of damages  if any  suffered by the plaintiff owners of the property 
however  an agreement to settle the litigation between the plaintiff owners of the property and the other involved parties  including the company  has been reached and finalized 
the company s share of the settlement costs were funded by the other defendants to the litigation 
the terms of the agreement are that the company must reimburse the other defendants to the litigation at least  per year for ten years  but that such amount can be paid from net production revenues from operation of the producing wells owned by the company on the property 
however  this is a non recourse agreement such that  should the wells be depleted before all such costs are reimbursed  the company is not required to fund the unreimbursed balance 
during and  net production revenues totaled  and  respectively 
based on past operation results of the producing well  the company believes that future net production revenues will be sufficient to fund the minimum required under the settlement agreement 
gambonini environmental on march   the company received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency usepa regarding the gambonini mine site site outside petaluma  marin county  california 
the company gathered and forwarded the information the usepa requested 
on may   the company  as the successor to buttes gas oil company bgo  received from the usepa a notice of potential liability and demand for payment of  for reimbursement of costs related to the usepa s removal and environmental restoration efforts at the site initiated in pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
bgo  predecessor by merger to the company  leased the site for mining purposes and operated a mercury mine there from to bgo s mining operations were terminated in subsequently  under the supervision of the environmental and planning representatives of marin county  bgo completed closure and environmental restoration activities at the site  including stabilization and re vegetation of the site 
bgo then quitclaimed the mining lease to the site owners  the gambonini s  in because of apparent overgrazing at the site subsequent to bgo s restoration efforts  a storm in caused severe flooding  which resulted in the failure of a dam built to retain mining materials 
runoff from the flood released mining materials into the creek below and  ultimately  into the tomales bay  a local recreation and fishing area 
in march  the company and the usepa reached an agreement in principle to settle the usepa s claim for payment by the company of  plus interest at the superfund rate which is currently  payable in three installments over a two year period 
this amount is accrued as of december  and this settlement agreement will resolve the usepa s claims for reimbursement of past environmental response costs under cercla  but does not resolve all possible claims the united states may have with respect to the gambonini mine site which could include  but not be limited to  claims for natural resource damages 
the united states has given no indication as to whether or not it will pursue such claims 
the company has agreed to toll the statute of limitations with respect to any natural resource damages claims  if any  from august  to april  rostone environmental in february  reunion was informed by a contracted environmental services consulting firm that soil and ground water contamination exists at its lafayette  indiana site 
since then  the company has expended  of remediation costs 
the company estimates completion of this remediation effort to be  factors that could affect future results reunion s vendors may restrict credit terms we have corrected many vendor related problems with liquidity generated from the refinancing and from asset sales during however  another period of tight liquidity could result in key vendors restricting or eliminating the extension of credit terms to us 
if this would happen  our ability to obtain raw materials would be strained significantly and our ability to manufacture products would be reduced 
reunion s bank financing is subject to financial covenants we have removed all defaults on our bank financing and senior notes 
however  our new bank financing is subject to monthly financial and other covenants 
if our operations do not improve during  we may fail to meet one or more financial or other covenants 
if this would happen  we would be in default on our bank obligations and  subject to the terms of the loan and security agreement  all of our bank loans would be due and payable 
although it may be possible to negotiate waivers of defaults  no assurances can be given that we would be able to do so 
reunion is exposed to the risks of litigation and environmental matters we have made significant progress in settling major exposures to litigation and environmental claims during however  we are still exposed to certain undecided litigation and environmental matters 
an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could have a significant negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
reunion operates in highly competitive mature  niche markets our products are sold in highly competitive mature  niche markets and we compete with companies of varying size  including divisions and subsidiaries of larger companies that have financial resources that exceed ours 
this combination of competitive and financial pressures could cause us to lose market share or erode prices  which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
reunion s past performance could impact future prospects our past performance has been poor 
because of this  potential or current customers may decide not to do business with us 
if this were to happen  our sales may not increase or may decline 
if sales do not increase or we experience a further decline in sales  our ability to cover costs would be further reduced  which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
reunion is a going concern the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
at december   the company has a deficiency in working capital of million net of related party obligations  a loss from continuing operations of million before gain on debt extinguishment  and a deficiency in assets of million 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we successfully refinanced our bank debt  extinguished a significant portion of our obligations under the senior notes and removed all previously existing defaults on our debt 
these steps were taken to improve liquidity and defer the principal maturities on a significant portion of our debt 
the company is investigating other recapitalization scenarios in an effort to provide additional liquidity and extinguishments or deferrals of debt obligations 
although we believe we can accomplish these plans  no assurances exist that we will 
failure to accomplish these plans could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity  financial position and future operations

accordingly  of the  principal amount of senior notes of noteholders that had consented to the various provisions and waivers  or million  was extinguished pursuant to the provisions of the consent 
as of december   accrued and unpaid interest related to the senior notes totaled million  of which million related to the  principal amount of senior notes of noteholders that had consented to the various provisions and waivers 
such interest was permanently extinguished pursuant to the provisions of the consent 
the remaining million of accrued and unpaid interest is included in accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  
the company is currently investigating other recapitalization scenarios that include  among other things  the use of additional private capital fund financing to repurchase at discounts with waivers of all accrued and unpaid interest some portion or all of our senior and unsecured suboridinate notes payable 
the company believes that  as the result of recent events related to our refinancing and senior notes and  in view of our continuing efforts to investigate other recapitalization scenarios  resulting gains from such activities do not meet the criteria pursuant to apb opinion no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the operation of its business  reunion industries has market risk exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  raw material prices and interest rates 
each of these risks and reunion industries strategies to manage the exposure is discussed below 
reunion industries manufactures its products in the united states and sells its products in the united states and in foreign countries 
the countries to which the company exports its products vary from year to year 
international sales in and were in four areas the far east  mexico  western europe  and canada 
the majority of international sales in and relate to pressure vessel sales to customers in taiwan and the people s republic of china 
of reunion s million of consolidated net sales for  million were export sales  of which million related to pressure vessel sales and million related to plastics 
the remainder related to cylinder sales in canada 
of the million of foreign pressure vessel sales  approximately million was in the far east principally china and taiwan and million was in western europe 
the remainder was in canada 
plastics export sales included million in mexico with the remainder in europe and canada 
of reunion s million of consolidated net sales for  million were export sales  of which million related to pressure vessel sales and million related to plastics 
the remainder related to cylinder sales  primarily  in canada 
of the million of foreign pressure vessel sales  approximately million was in the far east principally china and taiwan and million was in western europe 
the remainder were in the middle east and canada 
plastics export sales included million in mexico with the remainder in europe and canada 
export sales to foreign countries are denominated in us dollars  the company s reporting currency 
accordingly  transaction loss exposures due to fluctuations in the currencies of the countries to which the company s domestic locations export are minimal 
the major raw materials used by metals include welded and seamless steel tubing and pipe  steel alloy bars  steel plates  brass tubing and bars and aluminum extrusions 
the major raw material used by plastics is thermoplastic polymers 
these materials are available from a number of suppliers 

prices for these materials are affected by changes in market demand  and there can be no assurances that prices for these and other raw materials will not increase in the future 

reunion industries contracts with its plastics customers generally provide that such price increases can be passed through to its customers 
a change in raw material prices would affect results of operations by approximately  reunion industries operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt that carries variable interest rates 
the variable rate debt was approximately million at december   which is representative of balances outstanding during the year 
a change in interest rates would affect results of operations by approximately
