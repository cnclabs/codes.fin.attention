item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview as a result of the company s acquisition of cctv on february   the number of shares of the company s common stock outstanding increased from million shares to approximately million shares after considering shares which the company is committed to issue and expects to issue during its second fiscal quarter of fy the company s consolidated financial condition also changed from previous periods as a result of the consolidation of cctv s balance sheet 
the company s consolidated results of operations do not reflect the consolidation of cctv but they do include the company s equity interest in cctv s results of operations for the year ended december   which reflects the company s indirect interest in cctv s results for that period 
the company  through cctv  is now primarily in the business of delivering cable television  high speed data transmission and internet access services to a growing network in moscow  russia through its last mile access to the moscow fiber optic network mfon 
cctv s operations were initially funded in  but active sales and marketing did not begin until  and the expansion of cctv s access network did not begin until mid at the commencement of its operations  cctv operated an access network of approximately  homes and small businesses to market and sell its services 
construction of the network in areas in the central administrative district of moscow expanded this access network to  homes as of december   which has been further increased to  as of april  as a result of the increasing size of the market to which cctv can provide its services  the number of reported subscribers and the related revenues has also increased significantly 
the company also has a trading portfolio of equity investments of domestic companies 
from until march   the company owned and operated jm ney as its primary operating subsidiary 
the operating assets of jm ney were sold during the first quarter of fy and the net current assets of jm ney which were not sold have been liquidated 
the company retained ownership of jm ney s facility which it leases to the buyer of jm ney s operating assets under terms of an eight year lease which was negotiated in connection with the sale of jm ney s net assets 
due to the recent acquisition of cctv  and the sale of jm ney  the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and the financial condition of the company will not be indicative of the company s expectations of its future results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  investments  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition investment income and other income are recognized when earned and is based on changes in the fair value of marketable securities and realized gains and losses 
rental income from the lease of andersen land corp 
s real estate is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company to collect amounts due from others 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
when the company determines that it may not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated recoverable amounts is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a reduction in the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
prepaid pension expense the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pension plans which provides for the delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses that arise from differences between actual results of the plan from the actuarially calculated results based on several factors including employee mortality and turnover  investment return on plan assets and the discount rates used to record the present value of the obligations of the plan 
to the extent that unrecognized gains or losses exceed of the greater of the plans projected benefit obligation or the market value of its assets  such excess is amortized over the estimated remaining service period of active employees 
the company considers and adjusts the various assumptions utilized in the calculations such as the discount rate  future compensation growth rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets  as market conditions warrant 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant  and equipment and acquisition related intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets the company intends to hold for use  if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
for assets the company intends to dispose of by sale  a loss is recognized for the amount that the estimated fair value  less costs to sell  is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the company periodically evaluates the useful lives of its property  plant  and equipment based on changes in technology  current business developments  and other industry conditions 
it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of these factors 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 the company completes an impairment test of goodwill annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our business enterprise below its carrying value 
the impairment test requires the company to estimate the fair value of our overall business enterprise 
in the absence of a current transaction for the sale of our business enterprise  we believe a discounted cash flow dcf model  rather than the market price of our common stock is the best technique with which to estimate the fair value of our business enterprise 
the company has determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill  and therefore  the dcf model is largely a function of the cash flows of the business enterprise

the loss of certain state tax credits contributed to the lower effective tax benefit rate in fy income from discontinued operations during fy  jm ney s operations produced an after tax profit of  as compared to its net income from these operations of  in fy the results are not comparable because the company operated jm ney for less than one month during fy prior to its sale 
jm ney s results of operations for fy and fy are summarized as follows in thousands fy fy sales and revenue cost of sales operating expenses interest expense income tax expense net income preferred dividends preferred dividends totaled  during fy  as compared to  during fy conversions of preferred stock into common stock during fy led to the decrease 
liquidity and capital resources at february   consolidated cash and marketable securities totaled  as compared to  at february  during fy  the company used  of cash in its operating activities  but had a net increase of  in its short term trading portfolio 
the company used  of cash in investing activities  comprised primarily of amounts invested into cctv  and its financing activities provided  as a result of the net proceeds of a mortgage loan  less principal payments on such loan and the company s subordinated debentures and the payment of preferred dividends 
the company also acquired  of cash in its acquisitions of cctv and mbc 
the company s consolidated cash and short term investments are expected to be utilized to support cctv s operations until it has reached the point at which it is generating cash from operations  to support the company s corporate level costs  debt service and preferred dividend requirements and to further invest in the build out of cctv s last mile access network in moscow 
the agreements which the company entered into with comcor to acquire cctv require the company to make defined cash contributions into cctv  of which approximately  was made in april  million is required to be made upon the completion of a rights offering or other capital raising event and  of defined assets and cash are to be contributed by july  to the extent that the last component of these contributions to cctv are not made  the company will be liable to issue up to  shares of its common stock to comcor after considering a reduction of the contingent amount which will be effected as a result of the planned contribution of identified assets 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of february  includes approximately  of the company s common stock which will be issued in settlement of liabilities to comcor as contemplated in the may  stock subscription agreement between the company and comcor 
except for rental income from the lease of jm ney s manufacturing facility  the company has limited sources of cash incoming to meet its operating expense and debt service requirements 
the company s anticipates the need for additional financing to support its current operations 
currently  the company has commitments from existing shareholders for an additional million of funding if additional external financing is not obtained to fund the company s current operations and believes this amount will be sufficient to finance the current level of operations for the next months 
cctv s strategy and business plan will continue to require capital investment  which the company may not be able to obtain on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company is not able to attract additional capital  the build out of cctv s access network would not proceed as currently planned  which in turn  would significantly limit the ability for cctv to increase its revenues and achieve profitability 
if the company fails to obtain capital necessary to fund its business plan  cctv would have to delay  change or abandon market opportunities 
cctv expects to incur significant capital expenditures in fy and future years 
the actual amount of the funds required to finance cctv s network build out and other capital expenditures in future periods may vary materially from management s estimate 
cctv s purchase commitments for network equipment totaled  million as of february  in addition  cctv anticipates that it will enter into material purchase commitments in the future 
the company and cctv also may require substantial additional capital for the development of new services and network capacity expansion 
if the company and cctv were unable to finance their capital commitments either through cash from operations or external financing  there would be a material adverse effect on cctv s financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes it has a reasonable basis to expect that its efforts will be sufficiently successful to enable cctv to continue to take advantage of the market opportunities which the company believes exist in the moscow market  but there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so on favorable terms 
as of february   the company does not expect to have to make any contributions to fund the obligations of its defined benefit pension plan 
at february   the recorded value of the prepaid expense relating to this plan was  which represents and increase of  over the prior year s amount 
under the actuarial calculations  the plan is overfunded by  a decrease of  from the prior year 
in accordance with sfas  the company has not recognized net actuarial losses totaling  such losses have arisen primarily from changes in the actuarially assumed discount rate to value the plan s obligations 
the following table presents the company s contractual obligations as of february  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in equity security prices  interest rates and from factors that impact equity and operational investments in russia 
foreign investment risk the company s investment in cctv is subject to currency fluctuations  and the economic and political risks associated with russia 
the company has not entered into any derivative instruments to hedge the risks associated with this investment 
these investments also bear the risk of cctv s ability to increase its revenues through the addition of subscribers for its cable television  high speed data transmission and internet services 
the subscriber growth is largely dependent upon cctv s ability to build out its access network from the mfon which it leases from comcor  which is largely dependent upon it receiving a sufficient amount of capital to pay for the equipment and construction costs 
equity risk at february   the company held common stocks of various financial institutions totaling  the company bears the risk of the fluctuations of the market prices of these companies 
interest rate risk at february   the company had a mortgage loan payable with a remaining principal balance of  which bore interest at the rate of  which was based on the libor rate in effect at the origination of the loan 
in the future  the interest rate may fluctuate with changes in the libor rate 
the company estimates that a change in the interest rate during fy would increase the interest expense by approximately  factors affecting future financial results this form k  the company s annual report to shareholders  any form q or form k or any other written or oral statements made by or on the company s behalf include forward looking statements that reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
the forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
following the initial and subsequent investments into cctv which the company consummated in february  substantially all of the value of the company s assets now depend on cctv s financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  the following discussion relates primarily to the risks and uncertainties that affect cctv 
the following factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from anticipated results the company may experience liquidity difficulties 
the agreements with comcor that were consummated in february which resulted in the acquisition of cctv through the issuance of the company s common stock to comcor and to the former holders of of the shares of mbc  require the company to contribute additional capital to its wholly owned subsidiary  cctv 
in april  the company transferred approximately  to cctv 
additional required contributions are contingent upon a capital raising event  or if they are not made by july   the company is required to issue additional shares to comcor which would result in dilution of existing shareholders of the company 
the company cannot be assured of its ability to attract sufficient capital to continue to fund cctv s operations and its growth plans  or  if it is successful in attracting capital  whether the terms of such capital would be significantly dilutive to the existing stockholders in terms of percentage ownership  book value or market value 
the company has cash and short term investment resources at the corporate level which are being used to meet operating expenses  debt service payments and dividends on the company s preferred stock 
without additional sources of capital  the company is not expected to be able to invest significant additional amounts  if any  to support cctv s operations 
based on operating cash flow projections for fy  the company will require an additional million of additional financing over the next twelve months 
currently  the company has commitments from existing shareholders for an additional million of funding if additional external financing is not obtained to fund the company s current operations 
the company believes its existing cash and short term investment resources at the corporate level together with the financing commitments from existing shareholders are adequate to meet its requirements for the next year  but there can be no assurances that they will in fact be sufficient 
cctv s operations  while demonstrating significant revenue growth during the last two years  is still operating at a stage in which its revenues are not sufficient to meet its cash operating expenses 
in addition  cctv s operating plans involve the continued build out of its access network  which will be necessary to enable it to further market its services to more homes and small businesses 
cctv s financial resources  including the amounts recently provided by the company are not expected to be adequate for cctv to meet its operating objectives 
accordingly  without new sources of capital  cctv s future growth could be substantially limited and its ability to realize a return on its existing asset base or even achieve profitability could be very much in question 
risks related to the operation of cctv because cctv has had a limited operating history  its future performance is difficult to predict 
cctv s business strategy has been implemented recently and although it has experienced relatively strong growth in revenues  to date cctv s revenue growth has not been adequate to have it reach profitability or achieve positive cash flow from operations 
the growth of cctv depends on the appeal of the services it provides to russian consumers 
cctv s ability to establish itself in the russian market will be affected by several factors  including the ability of cctv or the company to attract adequate capital to fund its operations and capital expenditures  and the ability of cctv to continue and expand its growth rates in an increasingly competitive market 
there is no assurance that cctv will be successful in effectively implementing its business strategy and  because cctv has had a limited operating history  investors have limited basis upon which to form an evaluation of the prospects for performance and an investment in the company s common stock 
the company cannot assure that a market for cctv s future services will develop or that cctv can satisfy subscriber expectations 
cctv currently offers its subscribers a number of value added services  such as high speed internet access and cable television 
it also has plans to offer  ip based telephony and web hosting service 
cctv may not be successful in creating or competing in a market for these value added services 
in particular  the company cannot be assured that cctv can enhance its current services  develop new services that meet changing subscriber needs  generate significant demand for its new services through successful advertising and marketing initiatives  satisfy subscriber expectations with respect to value added services  provide its new services in a profitable manner  and continue to offer value added services in the event of adverse changes in economic conditions 
our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we are required to test both acquired goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach  rather than amortizing them over time 
we have chosen to perform our annual impairment review of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
if our market value is less than our book value for an extended period of time  we could be required to record an impairment charge 
additionally  goodwill must be tested between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we may also be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if  due to a change in strategy or other reason  the company determines that the value of other assets has been impaired or we terminate a contractual commitment 
the amount of any such annual or interim impairment or other charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
cctv operates in a highly competitive industry 
there is substantial competition in the television service industry 
we expect competition to intensify as a result of the development of new technologies  products and services  wireless number portability  and as market penetration increases 
other television service providers serve each of the markets in which cctv competes 
this competition may put downward pressure on subscriber and revenue growth and profit margins 
television service providers compete principally on service area  price  service quality  and features 
cctv s ability to compete successfully will depend on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors  including service quality  coverage area  new services  service features and enhancements  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions and competitors pricing strategies 
market prices for television services may decline in the future 
cctv anticipates that market prices for standard television services will continue to decline 
cctv expects significant competition among television service providers may continue to drive service and equipment prices lower 
cctv also expects that there will be increases in its advertising and promotional spending  along with increased demands on access to distribution channels 
all of this may lead to greater choices for customers  possible consumer confusion  and increasing movement of customers between competitors  which cctv refers to as churn 
if market prices decline  it could adversely affect cctv s ability to grow revenue  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
significant changes in technology or demand for television service could materially adversely affect us 
the television service industry is experiencing significant technological change 
this change includes evolving industry standards  ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology  shorter development cycles for new products  enhancements and changes in end user needs and preferences  development of data and high bandwidth network capabilities  migration to next generation services  and expanded availability and functionality of other competing technologies 
the pace and extent of customer demand may not continue to increase which could result in shortfalls from anticipated subscriber growth rates 
as a result  the future prospects of the industry and of cctv and the success of its competitive services remains uncertain 
also  alternative technologies may develop that may provide alternative service superior to that available from cctv 
such developments could have a material adverse affect on cctv 
cctv may not be able to fund future capital requirements 
cctv strategy and business plan will continue to require capital investment  which the company may not be able to obtain on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company is not able to attract additional capital  the build out of cctv s access network would not proceed as currently planned  which in turn  would significantly limit the ability for cctv to increase its revenues and achieve profitability 
if the company failed to obtain capital necessary to fund its business plan  cctv would have to delay  change or abandon market opportunities 
cctv expects to incur significant capital expenditures in fy and future years 
the actual amount of the funds required to finance cctv s network build out and other capital expenditures in future periods may vary materially from management s estimate 
cctv s purchase commitments for network equipment totaled  as of february  in addition  cctv anticipates that it may enter into material purchase commitments in the future based on the availability of additional financing in the future 
the company and cctv also may require substantial additional capital for the development of new services and network capacity expansion 
if the company and cctv were unable to finance their capital commitments either through cash from operations or external financing  there would have a material adverse effect on cctv s financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes it has a reasonable basis to expect that its efforts will be sufficiently successful to enable cctv to continue to take advantage of the market opportunities which the company believes exist in the moscow market  but there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so on favorable terms 
the actual amount of funds necessary to implement cctv s strategy and business plan may materially exceed current estimates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
the actual amount of funds necessary to implement cctv s strategy and business plan may materially exceed our current estimates in the event of various factors including departures from our current business plan  unforeseen delays  cost overruns  unanticipated expenses  regulatory developments  engineering design changes  and technological and other risks 
if actual costs do materially exceed current estimates for these or other reasons or cctv is unable to control or reduce costs  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to russia economic instability in russia could adversely affect cctv s business 
since the end of communism in the early s  russia s economy has been undergoing a rapid transformation from a one party state with a centrally planned economy to a pluralist democracy with a market oriented economy 
this transformation has been marked by periods of significant instability 
in particular  the russian government s decision to temporarily stop supporting the ruble in august caused the currency to collapse 
at the same time  the russian government defaulted on much of its short term domestic debt and imposed a day moratorium on foreign debt payments by russian companies 
the russian government subsequently entered into protracted negotiations with its creditors to reschedule the terms of its domestic and foreign debt 
thus far  these negotiations have not yielded terms favorable to western creditors 
it is possible that russia may default on its domestic or foreign debt in the future or take other actions that could adversely affect its financial stability 
operating in such an economic environment makes it more difficult for cctv to obtain and maintain credit facilities  access international capital markets and obtain other financing to satisfy cctv s future capital needs 
the august financial crisis marked the beginning of an economic downturn that affected the entire russian economy and resulted in russia s equity market being the worst performing equity market in the world for although the russian economy has experienced a positive trade balance in recent years  future downturns in the russian economy are possible and could diminish demand for cctv s services and cctv s ability to retain existing subscribers and collect payments from them 
future downturns in the russian economy could also prevent cctv from executing its growth strategy  which could cause its business to suffer 
although there have been improvements in the economic situation in the russian federation in recent years  the country continues to display some characteristics of an emerging market 
these characteristics include  but are not limited to  the existence of a currency that is not freely convertible in most countries outside of the russian federation  restrictive currency controls  and relatively high inflation 
the prospects for future economic stability are largely dependent upon the effectiveness of economic measures undertaken by the governments  together with legal  regulatory  and political developments 
fluctuations in the global economy may adversely affect russia s economy and cctv s business 
russia s economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world 
as has happened in the past  financial problems or an increase in the perceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies could dampen foreign investment in russia and adversely affect the russian economy 
in addition  a steep decline in the world price of oil could slow or disrupt the russian economy because russia produces and exports large amounts of oil 
these developments could severely limit cctv s access to capital and could adversely affect the purchasing power of cctv s customers and  consequently  cctv s business 
sustained periods of high inflation may adversely affect cctv s business 
russia has experienced high levels of inflation since the early s 
inflation increased dramatically following the august financial crisis 
the government s history of printing money to pay back wages  pensions and some of its debt has prompted concerns of hyperinflation 
due to high inflation and other economic and political pressures  the ruble lost significant value against the us dollar and other foreign currencies in and cctv s operating results could suffer if it is unable to sufficiently increase its prices to offset increased inflation 
social instability in russia could lead to increased support for centralized authority and a rise in nationalism  which could restrict the manner in which cctv operates its business 
social instability in russia  coupled with difficult economic conditions  could lead to increased support for centralized authority and a rise in nationalism 
these sentiments could lead to restrictions on foreign ownership of russian companies in the data communications industry or large scale nationalization or expropriation of foreign owned assets or businesses 
although the company does not anticipate the nationalization or expropriation of cctv s assets  the concept of property rights is not well developed in russian law and there is not a great deal of experience in enforcing legislation enacted to protect private property against nationalization and expropriation 
as a result  the company may not be able to obtain proper redress in the courts  and cctv may not receive adequate compensation if in the future the russian government decides to nationalize or expropriate some or all of its assets 
if this occurs  the company s business could be harmed
