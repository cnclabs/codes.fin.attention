item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in part iv  item of this report and the risk factors section at the end of this item  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock 
overview broadcom corporation is a leading provider of highly integrated semiconductor solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice  video and data services 
we design  develop and supply complete system on a chip soc solutions incorporating digital  analog and radio frequency rf technologies  as well as related hardware and software system level applications 
our diverse product portfolio addresses every major broadband communications market and includes solutions for digital cable and satellite set top boxes  high definition television hdtv  cable and dsl modems and residential gateways  high speed transmission and switching for local  metropolitan  wide area and storage networking  home and wireless networking  cellular and terrestrial wireless communications  voice over internet protocol voip gateway and telephony systems  broadband network and security processors  and systemi o server solutions 
net revenue 
we sell our products to leading manufacturers of broadband communications equipment in each of our target markets 
because we leverage our technologies across different markets  certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in several different markets 
we utilize independent foundries to manufacture all of our semiconductor products 
our net revenue consists principally of product revenue generated by sales of our semiconductor products 
such sales represented over of our total net revenue in  and  respectively 
we generate the balance of our net revenue mainly from development agreements  software licenses and maintenance agreements  and system level reference designs 
the vast majority of our sales occur through our direct sales force 
however  we derived approximately  and of our total net revenue from sales made through distributors in  and  respectively 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  and the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue 
from time to time  our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect these fluctuations will continue 

table of contents sales to our significant customers  including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors  as a percentage of net revenue were as follows years ended december  hewlett packard dell motorola cisco five largest customers as a group less than of net revenue 
includes sales to compaq  which was acquired by hewlett packard in may  for all periods presented 
includes sales to linksys  which was acquired by cisco in june  for all periods presented 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
these customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
net revenue derived from all independent customers located outside the united states as a percent of total net revenue was as follows years ended december  asia europe other such net revenue does not include revenue from products shipped to subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that have headquarters in the united states even though such subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors are located outside of the united states 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volumes of product sales  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  the effects of competition and competitive pricing strategies  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  fluctuations in direct product costs such as wafer pricing and assembly  packaging and testing costs  and overhead costs such as prototyping expenses  amortization of purchased intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  product warranty costs  provisions for excess or obsolete inventories  licensing and royalty arrangements  and the mix of product revenue and development revenue 
product cycles 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than six months  with an additional three to more than nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  selling  general and 
table of contents administrative efforts  and investments in inventory  to the time we generate corresponding revenue  if any 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month 
if anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
acquisition strategy 
a key element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combination transactions  strategic relationships  capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets 
in  and we completed six acquisitions for original aggregate equity consideration of billion and cash consideration of million 
in we acquired certain assets of gadzoox networks  inc  a provider of open standards based storage networking technology 
in we acquired mobilink telecom  inc  a supplier of chipsets and reference designs for use in cellular phones  cellular modem cards and wireless pdas 
in we acquired visiontech ltd  a supplier of digital video audio mpeg compression and decompression chips  serverworks corporation  a supplier of high performance system input output integrated circuits for servers  workstations and storage platforms  kimalink  a developer of integrated circuits for wireless data communications  and portatec corporation  a developer of integrated solutions for smart mobile devices 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing as of their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
business enterprise segments 
we operate in one reportable operating segment  broadband communications 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements 
although we had four operating segments at december   under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas  we only operate in one reportable operating segment  broadband communications 
under sfas  two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas  if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of products and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customer for their products and services  and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services 
we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons the sale of integrated circuits is the only material source of revenue for each of our four operating segments  the integrated circuits sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard cmos manufacturing process  the integrated circuits marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to one type of customer manufacturers of broadband equipment  who incorporate our integrated circuits into their electronic products  and all of our integrated circuits are sold through a centralized sales force and common wholesale distributors 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth above and each of our operating segments has similar economic characteristics  we aggregate our results of operations in one reportable operating segment 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  strategic investments  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  restructuring costs and litigation and other loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue  gross margin  accounts receivable and inventory 
we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii transfer of title has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
product revenue on sales made through these distributors is deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs and rebates  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  or ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our stock  
table of contents iii another significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets used in operations  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
strategic investments 
we have made strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
strategic investments in which we hold less than a voting interest and on which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
the share prices of publicly traded securities have been volatile  and the value of non publicly traded securities is difficult to determine 
we periodically review these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value based on the specific identification method and write down investments to their fair value  with a corresponding loss recorded in other income expense  net  in the statement of operations  when we believe an other than temporary decline has occurred 
when determining whether a decline is other than temporary  we examine i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value of an investment has been lower than its carrying value  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  including any specific events that may influence the operations of the investee such as changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investee  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the investee for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we generally believe an other than temporary decline has occurred when the fair value of the investment is below the carrying value for two consecutive quarters  absent evidence to the contrary 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using their quoted market prices 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based upon one or more of the following a the values of recent rounds of financing  b pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information  and or c quoted market prices of comparable public companies 
although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of the non publicly traded securities that we hold  had there been an active market for the equity securities  the carrying values might have been materially different than the amounts reported 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of companies in which we have made such investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying values of the investments that may not be reflected in the investments current carrying values  and could require future impairment charges 
deferred taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
as a result of our recent cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carrybacks  we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that carries a valuation allowance  we will record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
restructuring charges 
we have undertaken  and we may in the future undertake  significant restructuring initiatives  which have required us to develop formalized plans for exiting certain business activities and or facilities 
we have had to record estimated expenses for lease cancellations  long term asset write downs  severance and outplacement costs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance  complexity  and the timing of the execution of such activities  we periodically reassess the estimates we made at the time 
table of contents the original decisions were made 
through the accounting rules for restructuring costs and asset impairments required us to record provisions and charges when we had a formal and committed plan 
in calculating the cost to dispose of our excess facilities  we had to estimate our future space requirements and the timing of exiting excess facilities and then estimate for each location the future lease and operating costs to be paid through the termination of the lease and the amount  if any  of sublease income 
to form our estimates for these costs  we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
our assumptions on future space requirements  operating costs until termination and or offsetting sublease revenues may be incorrect  and our actual costs may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs or to reverse previously recorded liabilities 
we periodically evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
beginning in the accounting rules require us to record any future provisions and charges at fair value in the period in which they are incurred 
as management continues to evaluate the business  there may be additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
litigation and settlement costs 
from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation or settlement payments 
if that occurs  our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected  and we may be required to make future royalty payments  which could adversely impact gross margins 
in addition  if further information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation is probable  and we can reasonably estimate a range of loss associated with such litigation  we would then record at least the minimum estimated liability 
however the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs

table of contents net revenue 
our revenue consists principally of product revenue generated by sales of our semiconductor products 
net revenue is revenue less provisions for returns and allowances 
the following table presents the contribution to the increase in net revenue in as compared to from each of our major target markets years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages enterprise networking broadband communications mobile and wireless net revenue the growth in net revenue resulted primarily from an increase in volume shipments of our semiconductor products stemming from the rise in demand for our products in each of our major target markets in our enterprise networking products include ethernet controllers  phys and switches  network processors  server chipsets  and security and storage products 
our broadband communications products include solutions for cable modem  cable tv set top box  direct broadcast satellite and dsl applications 
our mobile and wireless products include wireless lan  cellular and bluetooth solutions 
we anticipate that total net revenue in the first quarter of will increase by approximately to over the fourth quarter level 
we also expect the net revenue increase in the first quarter of will be distributed across all three of our major target markets 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test and quality assurance for semiconductor products  prototyping costs  amortization of purchased technology  and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  product warranty costs  provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and contracted development work 
gross profit represents net revenue less the cost of revenue 
the increase in absolute dollars for gross profit resulted primarily from the growth in net revenue 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue in resulted primarily from lower amortization of purchased intangible assets  lower stock based compensation expense and shifts in our product mix  offset in part by additional stock based compensation expense due to our stock option exchange 
the following table presents details of non cash expenses for employees engaged in manufacturing operations for and that are included in cost of revenue years ended december  of net of net increase amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangible assets stock option exchange expense at december  the unamortized balance of deferred compensation was approximately million  which will be amortized to cost of revenue through at december  the unamortized balance of purchased intangible assets was approximately million  all of which will be amortized to cost of revenue in 
table of contents gross profit has been and will likely continue to be impacted in the future by competitive pricing strategies  fluctuations in the volume of our product sales  fluctuations in silicon wafer costs and assembly  packaging and testing costs  product warranty costs  provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and possible future changes in product mix and the introduction of products with lower margins  among other factors 
in addition  we anticipate that gross profit could continue to be impacted by amortization charges related to possible future acquisitions 
research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses the following table presents research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses for and years ended december  of net of net increase amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages research and development selling  general and administrative research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware  subcontracting costs  prototyping costs and facilities expenses 
research and development expense does not include amounts associated with stock based compensation or stock option exchange expenses for employees engaged in research and development or expense amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development activities 
the decrease in research and development expense in absolute dollars resulted primarily from a million decrease in personnel related expenses and a million decrease in prototyping costs due to our restructuring efforts 
in addition  there were modest decreases in system level testing and costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware 
research and developments costs in reflected costs savings resulting from the restructuring plan we began implementing in the fourth quarter of  or the restructuring plan  which included workforce reductions 
this was partially offset by new hires in as well as a change in our employee compensation policies implemented in the second quarter of that resulted in an increase in cash compensation to certain employees 
savings from our restructuring plan will continue to be offset by any new hires in the future and any future acquisitions 
in addition  based upon past experience  we anticipate that research and development expense in absolute dollars will increase over the long term as a result of the growth and diversification of the markets we serve  new product opportunities  changes in our compensation policies and any expansion into new markets and technologies 
we remain committed to a significant level of research and development effort to extend our technology leadership in the broadband communications markets in which we operate 
we hold over us patents and we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional patents in broadband communications and other fields 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses  communications expenses and trade show expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense does not include amounts associated with stock based compensation or stock option exchange expenses for administrative employees or expense amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to selling  general and administrative activities 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars resulted primarily from a million increase in legal costs 
in addition  there were modest increases in salaries and related costs  insurance costs and bad debt expense  offset in part by a decrease in information technology maintenance and supplies expense and expenditures for travel and entertainment 
based upon past experience  we anticipate that over the long term selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase to 
table of contents support any expansion of our operations through indigenous growth and acquisitions  as a result of periodic changes in our infrastructure to support any increased headcount  changes in our compensation policies  acquisition and integration activities  and international operations  and as a result of current and any future litigation to protect our business interests and intellectual property 
stock based compensation expense the following table presents stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development and selling  general and administrative activities for and  all of which was excluded from those operating expenses years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages research and development selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense generally represents the amortization of deferred compensation as well as expense related to options subject to variable accounting 
deferred compensation primarily represents the difference between the fair value of our class a common stock at the measurement date of each acquisition and the original purchase price of the restricted stock or exercise price of the unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable options  generally three to five years 
additional deferred compensation related to earned contingent consideration is measured and recorded at the date the contingency is satisfied 
employee terminations in and resulted in the elimination of deferred compensation of approximately million and million  respectively  that is no longer amortized 
we recorded approximately million of net deferred compensation in primarily for contingent consideration earned in connection with our acquisitions of serverworks and mobilink 
we recorded approximately million of deferred compensation in primarily for restricted stock assumed in our acquisition of mobilink 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense related primarily to the elimination of deferred compensation due to the termination of certain employees and certain assumed options being fully amortized  offset in part by the acceleration from future periods of stock based compensation expense related to certain assumed stock options and additional deferred compensation related to earned contingent consideration 
at december  the unamortized balance of deferred compensation was approximately million  which will be amortized to research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses through however  if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying restricted stock or unvested stock options  we may be required to either accelerate from future periods or cancel the remaining deferred compensation 
in the event additional deferred compensation is recorded in connection with any future acquisitions  our operating expense would be impacted by its amortization 

table of contents amortization of purchased intangible assets the following table presents amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development and selling  general and administrative activities for and  all of which was excluded from those operating expenses years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages research and development selling  general and administrative purchased intangible assets primarily include completed technology  customer relationships  contracts and backlog  and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the respective assets  ranging from less than one to three years 
the decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets was primarily a result of certain purchased intangible assets being fully amortized 
we currently have no remaining purchased intangible assets to amortize to future operating expense 
however  if we acquire purchased intangible assets in the future  our operating expense would be impacted by the amortization of these assets 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the following table presents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for and years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we performed our annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with our various acquisitions required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  in october and in addition  we determined that indicators of impairment existed for two of our reporting units in may and an additional impairment assessment was performed at that time 
in accordance with sfas  we compared the carrying value of each of our reporting units that existed at those times to their estimated fair values 
at october  and  we had four and seven reporting units  respectively 
we determined and identified those reporting units in accordance with sfas we estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as verification of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete four year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed to our board of directors 
cash flows beyond the four year discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies 
future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in financial accounting standards board  or fasb  concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
specifically  the income approach valuation used reporting unit cash flow discount rates ranging from to  and terminal value growth rates ranging from to 
publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our 
table of contents company was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
upon completion of the october annual impairment assessment  we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair values of the four reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values 
upon completion of the october assessment  we determined that the carrying values of four of our seven reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values 
the four affected reporting units were broadband processors  client server networking  mobile communications and serverworks 
because indicators of impairment existed for these four reporting units  we performed the second step of the test required under sfas to determine the fair value of the goodwill for each of the affected reporting units 
in accordance with sfas  the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as that which is utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
as part of the second step of the impairment test performed in  we calculated the fair value of certain assets  including developed technology and in process research and development  or ipr d  assets 
to determine the implied value of goodwill  fair values were allocated to the assets and liabilities of each of the four affected reporting units in the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of the affected reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for each of the affected reporting units was measured by the amount the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on this assessment  we recorded a charge of billion in october of such charge  million related to the goodwill of our broadband processor reporting unit  million related to the goodwill of our client server networking reporting unit  million related to the goodwill of our mobile communications reporting unit and million related to the goodwill of our serverworks reporting unit 
the primary factors resulting in the impairment charge were i the continued significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and the semiconductor industry  which affected both our operations at that time and our expectations with respect to future revenue  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our stock  and iii unfavorable revisions in revenue and cash flow expectations regarding certain of our acquired businesses 
these acquired businesses were priced based on valuation multiples that were indicative of the value at which businesses were purchased and sold at that time  but were inflated relative to historical and subsequent standards 
in the second and third quarters of demand for servers  wan networking equipment  handheld devices and other products using our chips declined relative to the demand that was anticipated when certain of our purchase acquisitions were consummated 
in addition  we recognized that a sustained decline in demand combined with an oversupply of these products resulted in increased price competition for certain chipsets  giving effect to shrinking profit margins and expected future cash flows for our four affected reporting units 
in response to the existing market conditions  we initiated a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of that included significant headcount reductions  and we decreased our investment in certain target markets that were either performing below our expectations or had low near term growth potential 
as a result  we revised our forecasts of future operating results  which were in turn used in calculating the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
in may we determined there were indicators of impairment for two of our reporting units  serverworks and mobile communications 
we tested the goodwill of these reporting units for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
as described above 
based on this assessment  we recorded a charge of million in june to write down the value of goodwill associated with the reporting units 
of this charge  million represented the balance of goodwill related to the serverworks reporting unit and million represented the balance of goodwill related to the mobile communications reporting unit 
with respect to the serverworks reporting unit  the primary factors that contributed to the impairment assessment were additional competitive pressures in the server market and recent design losses experienced by that reporting unit that were attributable  in part  to our ongoing inability to obtain required design information from a third party that is also a competitor 
another factor that contributed to the impairment assessment was the recording of additional goodwill due to contingent consideration earned by former serverworks stockholders and employees see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the competitive pressures 
table of contents and design losses  we reduced our forecasts of future operating results for the serverworks reporting unit for periods beginning as early as the second quarter of with the expectation of future loss of market share for that business 
these forecasts in turn formed the basis for estimating the fair value of the serverworks reporting unit as of june we are continuing to pursue strategies to reposition our serverworks business and develop alternative sources of revenue for that reporting unit 
with respect to the mobile communications reporting unit  the primary factor that contributed to the impairment assessment was the recording of additional goodwill due to contingent consideration earned by former mobilink shareholders and employees in may see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  after that reporting unit had already been written down to its implied fair value in october in december and  we acquired over patents related to various technologies  including among others  wireless networking topologies and protocols  dual mode wireless transceivers  power management in integrated circuits  ethernet networking  personal video recording  and voip telephony  for an aggregate of million and million  respectively 
the immediate purpose of these patent acquisitions was to assist us in the defense and settlement of ongoing and future lawsuits 
as a result  we were unable to estimate any future cash flows from the patents 
we also do not have any plans to resell the patents to a third party 
due to our intended use for these assets  we concluded that indicators of impairment existed upon acquisition of the patents because it appeared that the carrying amount of the patents might not be recoverable 
upon determining that indicators of impairment existed  we performed a recoverability test in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of long lived assets should include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
the cash flows expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the patents are actually the cash savings resulting from reduced but undeterminable legal expenditures over the next several years 
due to the unpredictable nature of legal disputes  it is not possible to reasonably i determine if our strategy with respect to the patents will be successful  ii forecast legal expenditures that would have been incurred if the patent portfolio was not acquired and iii forecast cash flows generated as a result of acquiring the patents 
as a result  pursuant to sfas no reasonable analysis could be prepared to support future cash flows associated with the patents 
accordingly  the patents were determined to be fully impaired at their respective dates of acquisition

under the program  employees holding options to purchase our class a or class b common stock were given the opportunity to exchange certain of their existing options  with exercise prices at or above per share 
stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares with a weighted average exercise price of per share were eligible for tender at the commencement of the program  representing approximately of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date 

table of contents on may  the offer period ended and we accepted for exchange and cancellation vested eligible options to purchase  shares of class a or class b common stock  with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in exchange  we issued  fully vested  non forfeitable shares of our class a common stock and recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million related to the issuance of such vested shares  based on the closing price of our class a common stock on may  of per share 
the  shares were included in our calculation of net loss per share effective as of may  additionally  on may  we accepted for exchange and cancellation unvested eligible options to purchase  shares of class a or class b common stock  with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in exchange  new options to purchase  shares of our class a common stock were issued on november  the terms and conditions of the new options  including the vesting schedules  were substantially the same as the terms and conditions of the options cancelled 
the exercise price for the new options was per share which was the last reported trading price of our class a common stock on the grant date 
at december  there were options to purchase  shares of class a or class b common stock outstanding 
eligible employees members of our board of directors were not eligible to participate in the offer who participated in the offer received  in exchange for the cancellation of vested eligible options  an amount of consideration  represented by fully vested  non forfeitable common stock  equal to the number of shares underlying such vested eligible options  multiplied by the offered value as determined under certain terms and conditions set forth in our offer  divided by the closing price of our class a common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market on may  we concluded that the consideration paid for the eligible options represented substantial consideration as required by emerging issues task force issue no 
issues relating to accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 or eitf  as the offered value per vested option was at least equal to the fair value for each eligible option  as determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
in determining the fair value of the eligible options using the black scholes option pricing model  we primarily used the following assumptions i an expected life of approximately four years  ii a volatility of during that expected life  iii a risk free interest rate of  and iv no dividends 
the weighted average offered value per vested option share was 
certain of our employees held unvested eligible options that were previously assumed by us in connection with acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we had recorded deferred compensation with respect to those options based upon the applicable stock market valuation at the time of acquisition 
to the extent those employees tendered  and we accepted for exchange and cancellation  such assumed eligible options in exchange for new options  we were required to immediately accelerate the amortization of the remaining related deferred compensation previously recorded 
consequently  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million in may  reflecting the acceleration from future periods of stock based compensation expense 
variable accounting is not required under eitf for eligible options subject to the offer that were not surrendered for cancellation  because i the shares of class a common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and non forfeitable and ii the number of shares received by an employee who accepted the offer was based on the number of surrendered eligible options multiplied by the offered value per vested option  divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange 
we further concluded that the look back and look forward provisions of paragraph of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 or fin  applied to the stock options surrendered for cancellation 
if any stock options were granted to participants in the offer within the six months prior to or following may   those stock options would be subject to variable accounting 
as a result of these provisions  variable accounting is required for options to purchase approximately  shares as of december  in we recorded approximately million of stock based compensation expense related to the portion of these variable options that vested during the period 
in addition to the non cash charges described above  we incurred certain associated employer payroll taxes and professional fees of approximately million in connection with the offering 
employees were responsible

in august we agreed with intel corporation to settle all outstanding litigation between the companies as well as litigation involving our respective affiliates 
in connection with the settlement agreement  we agreed to pay intel million  of which million was paid in august  and the remaining balance was paid in october in january we entered into a settlement and license agreement to settle certain disputes 
in connection with the settlement  we recorded million as a one time charge for the disputes and claims in december and also recorded an asset of million pertaining to a related license agreement in january under the agreement  we are required to pay million in cash  million of which was paid in january  and the remainder of which will be paid in four equal installments of million on the anniversary date of the settlement agreement over each of the next four years

as a result of the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry  we announced an additional restructuring program  the restructuring plan  which we implemented from the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of the plans focused on cost reductions and operating efficiencies  including workforce reductions and lease terminations 
these restructuring plans resulted in certain business unit realignments  workforce reductions and 
table of contents consolidation of excess facilities 
approximately and employees were terminated across all of our business functions and geographic regions in connection with the and restructuring plans  respectively

although not related to the or restructuring plans  we assumed additional liabilities of approximately million in connection with the mobilink acquisition for the consolidation of excess facilities  relating primarily to lease terminations  non cancelable lease costs and write offs of leasehold improvements 
the liabilities related to the mobilink acquisition have been classified as restructuring liabilities for presentation in the consolidated balance sheets 
these restructuring charges are classified as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
certain of the restructuring charges were recorded in periods subsequent to the initial implementations of the and restructuring plans 
these subsequent charges were primarily due to the inability to reasonably estimate those costs at the time of the initial implementations as we were still in the process of reviewing many of our facilities to determine where we could consolidate and which locations would no longer be required 
we do not anticipate recording any additional charges under the and restructuring plans 
the consolidation of excess facilities costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through the goal of our and restructuring plans was to reduce our research and development and selling  general and administrative operating expenses  but we cannot assure you that we will achieve future expense reductions and other benefits that we anticipated 
anticipated savings from reduced headcount or facility consolidations have been and may in the future be  mitigated by subsequent increases to headcount  changes in our employee compensation policies and subsequent facilities additions related to our operating requirements

in september we realized a gain from a strategic investment in the amount of million 
that investment was previously written down by million in september  representing an other than temporary decline in the value of that investment at the time  as described below 
this gain was offset in part by losses recorded in the amount of million  representing other than temporary declines in the value of other strategic investments 
in we recorded impairment losses on strategic investments of approximately million in two separate periods 
we recorded a loss of approximately million in february  which was based on information that led us to believe that the investee was proceeding into either a major financial restructuring and or bankruptcy 
this belief was based on our working knowledge of the investee  the fact that we had been solicited by the investee company for continued financings and the poor performance of venture technology investments in the geographical region 
previously  this privately held investment was reduced to its fair value of million in september based on a then recent round of financing 
we also recorded impairment losses on strategic investments of million in september approximately million related to a second privately held investment 
originally  this investment had high growth prospects and was proposed to be selected for a key customer design win 
this key design win potentially would have generated hundreds of millions in revenue over the next several years and positioned the investee for either an initial public offering or as an acquisition target 
ultimately  the investee did not secure the key design win  and  accordingly  was forced to enter into discussions to obtain a subsequent round of financing at a lower valuation 
therefore  at september  we believed it was necessary to permanently reduce the carrying value of this investment to its respective fair value  based on the term sheet for the potential subsequent financing 
in addition approximately million in impairment losses was related to a third privately held investment 
the impairment was caused by an impending financing that was offered at a price substantially lower than our previously reduced carrying value 
earlier  this privately held investment was reduced to its fair value of million in september based on a pricing model using historical financial information 
in september we recorded an additional million in impairment losses relating to other strategic investments using the same methodologies described above 
the losses recorded in were offset in part by approximately million in gains realized on sales of an investment in a publicly traded company

in january the average trading price of our class a common stock was approximately per share 
in the ensuing three month period  our stock price declined to an average price of per share in march  
table of contents representing a decline 
given the high volatility in market prices of internet related  semiconductor and other high technology stocks in general  and in our class a common stock in particular  it was unclear at that time whether the change in market price was due to a short term fluctuation or recognition of a new pricing threshold 
in the next six month period  the average price for our class a common stock in any given month fluctuated from approximately to per share 
in september our management concluded that the decline in market value of our stock from january to march was a sustained decrease 
accordingly  in september we determined that an assessment of the goodwill arising from certain of our purchase transactions was warranted 
the assessment was performed in accordance with the two step test prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas the first step involved a recoverability test to determine whether the sum of undiscounted future cash flows associated with certain acquired entities exceeded the carrying amounts of those respective entities assets 
the cash flows were estimated over a four year period and represented the cash flows identifiable to the entity 
the first step resulted in a failed recoverability test for goodwill directly related to the purchase transactions of allayer communications  silicon spice  inc and newport communications  inc 
certain of the affected businesses operated in high risk  emerging markets in which there was no assurance of sustainable sales at the time acquisition decisions were made 
several factors contributed to the impairment charge  including i declining semiconductor company stock valuations  ii lower than anticipated demand for certain products including metro class ethernet networking  carrier class and optical transceivers and iii higher than expected research and development costs to launch products in the aforementioned markets 
as a result  these factors diminished the cash flow that had been anticipated when certain purchase transactions were consummated 
the second step of the impairment test entailed estimating the fair value of net assets for those acquired businesses that failed the recoverability test 
fair value was determined using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounting of future cash flows 
the cash flow period used was five years  with a discount rate ranging from to  and estimated terminal values based on a terminal growth rate of 
the discount rate was based on our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate and estimated terminal values  reflected management s best estimates 
in accordance with sfas  the goodwill impairment charge was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of net assets exceeded fair value 
based on this assessment  we recorded a charge of billion to write down the value of goodwill associated with the affected purchase transactions 
of such charge  million related to the goodwill associated with allayer communications  million related to the goodwill associated with newport communications and million related to the goodwill associated with silicon spice

table of contents amortization of goodwill 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquired company and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the significant decrease in the amortization of goodwill in resulted from the impact of adopting new accounting standards 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas  and sfas  both effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these rules  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas was immediately applicable to any acquisitions made after june  as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill of billion beginning january  included in this amount is million of assembled workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets  which was reclassified as goodwill effective january  as required by sfas in process research and development 
the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
there was no ipr d recorded in connection with the acquisition completed in ipr d totaled million for the four purchase transactions completed in the fair value of ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance upon core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based upon forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles and market penetration and growth rates 
the ipr d charge includes only the fair value of ipr d performed as of the acquisition date 
the fair value of developed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets  and future research and development is included in goodwill 
we believe the amounts recorded as ipr d  as well as developed technology  represent fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects at the time of the respective acquisitions 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations for our significant purchase transactions completed in weighted average average estimated risk estimated estimated cost to adjusted percent time to complete discount ipr d purchase transaction development projects complete complete in millions rate in millions visiontech video compression integrated circuits year serverworks high performance systemi o integrated circuits for servers years we completed all of the visiontech development projects as expected in serverworks completed two development projects in approximately million over the previous estimate was required to complete these projects 
serverworks reallocated the resources on the remaining project to focus on next generation semiconductor products that it believes are better aligned with future demand 
except as noted above  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for 
table of contents the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may potentially result in impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
other income and expenses the following table presents other income and expenses for and years ended december  of net of net increase amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages interest income  net other income expense  net interest income  net 
the decrease resulted primarily from an overall decline in both our cash and marketable securities balances and the interest rates thereon 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  primarily includes recorded gains and losses on strategic investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and dispositions of property and equipment 
for further discussion of our other than temporary declines in strategic investments recorded in  see the comparable discussion included under the years ended december  and caption above 
in we recorded other than temporary declines in strategic investments of million 
included in this amount was approximately million related to publicly traded companies and million related to privately held companies  which are described in detail below 
in september we recorded other than temporary losses of approximately million related to securities associated with underlying shares of two publicly traded companies that were originally purchased in the fourth quarter of the fair values of these investments were determined using the quoted market prices of the underlying publicly traded shares in conjunction with other inputs used in standard valuation methodologies in certain cases where the securities did not have a liquid market 
prior to recording these losses  we calculated and recorded on a quarterly basis unrealized gains and losses as part of comprehensive income based on their respective quoted market prices 
prior to the third quarter of  we determined that the decline in fair value for these investments was temporary and concluded that it was likely that we would be able to recover the carrying value of our investment in a reasonable time period 
at the time  we relied  in part  on certain analysts reports regarding future prospects  target stock prices  and annualized stock price volatility in the two quarters leading up to the third quarter of in september  we determined it was appropriate under guidance provided by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  to record an other than temporary loss due to the sustained decline in value over the previous two consecutive quarters 
therefore we permanently reduced the carrying value of these investments to their respective fair values 
the additional losses of approximately million recorded in september were related to other than temporary declines in our privately held investments 
we considered the losses relating to our publicly traded investments and determined these losses were indicators of potential impairment with respect to our privately held investments 
therefore we performed an evaluation of the fair value for all of our privately held investments to determine if other impairments existed 
the fair values were estimated based upon one or more of the following i the values of recent rounds or discussions of financing  ii pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information  and or iii quoted market prices of comparable public companies 
additionally  in one instance  a development partner cancelled a significant development project with one of our investees during the period and  as a result  we immediately impaired the entire investment of million 
based on these valuations and other indicators of impairment  we permanently reduced the carrying value of these investments to their respective fair values 

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes the following table presents provision benefit for income taxes for and years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million in and a tax benefit of approximately million in  which resulted in effective tax rates of approximately in and in the federal statutory rate was for both periods 
the differences between our effective tax rates for and and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effects of nondeductible ipr d  amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related expenses from the purchase transactions completed in  and  as well as increases in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  and we had recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  reflecting an increase in the valuation allowance in of approximately million 
in we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate as a result of our recent cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carrybacks 
impact of adoption of accounting standard in june the fasb issued sfas under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill of approximately billion beginning january   which included approximately million of assembled workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets  which was reclassified as goodwill effective january  the following table presents the impact of sfas on net loss and net loss per share had the standard been in effect for all periods presented years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net loss as reported adjustments amortization of goodwill amortization of assembled workforce previously classified as a purchased intangible asset income tax effect net adjustments net loss as adjusted net loss per share basic and diluted as reported net loss per share basic and diluted as adjusted 
table of contents subsequent events in january we completed the acquisition of raidcore  inc  a developer of redundant array of inexpensive disks  or raid  and virtualization software 
in connection with the acquisition  we expect to pay approximately million in cash  of which approximately million was paid in january the remaining amount will be paid to the founders and employees of the company subject to a two to four year vesting period and will result in additional compensation expense over those respective periods 
we will record a one time charge in the first quarter of of approximately million for purchased in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition 
in january we acquired approximately patents and patent applications related to the read channel and hard disk controller markets  for approximately million 
pursuant to sfas  the patents were determined to be fully impaired at the date of acquisition 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a similar discussion regarding the impairment of a patent portfolio 
the impairment charge for the patent portfolio will be classified as an operating expense in the first quarter of in february we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s and an acquisition shelf registration statement on form s with the sec 
once declared effective by the sec  the universal shelf on form s will permit us to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of our class a common stock  shares of preferred stock or debt securities  or any combination of such securities  for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to million 
the acquisition shelf registration statement on form s will  once declared effective by the sec  enable us to issue up to million shares of our class a common stock in one or more acquisition transactions 
these transactions may include the acquisition of assets  businesses or securities  whether by purchase  merger or any other form of business combination 
we currently have no immediate plans to issue securities pursuant to either of these registration statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in january the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  which was amended in december fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity  or vie  to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the voting equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
development stage entities that have sufficient equity invested to finance the activities they are currently engaged in and entities that are businesses  as defined in fin  are not considered vies 
the provisions of fin were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january  for remaining arrangements entered into with vies created before january   the provisions of fin are effective at the end of the first reporting period ending after march  we have completed a review of our investments in both non marketable and marketable equity securities as well as other arrangements to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of any vies

accounts receivable increased million to million in the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of the million increase in net revenue in the fourth quarter of to million  as compared with million in the fourth quarter of due to the nature of our business  we experience working capital needs for accounts receivable 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis with our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if our revenue continues to increase as it has in the most recent past  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers 
inventories increased million to million in primarily due to higher levels of purchase orders received from our customers and also based upon our forecast of future demand for certain key products 
in the future  our inventory levels will be determined based on these factors as well as the product life cycle stage of our products and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
investing activities provided cash of million in  which was primarily the result of million in net proceeds received from the maturities of marketable securities and million in net proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments  offset in part by the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of million in net assets of a business

cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily the result of million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million in repayments of debt and capital lease obligations 
due to the increase in our stock price  a greater number of employees exercised their options and we received more proceeds from the exercise of stock options in than we did in in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past

the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  payment obligations by year in thousands there after total operating leases purchase obligations restructuring liabilities settlement payments total we lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through purchase obligations are comprised of purchase commitments for silicon wafers  assembly and test services  lab test equipment  computer hardware  information systems infrastructure and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of business 
our restructuring liabilities consist primarily of estimated future lease and operating costs on restructured facilities  less offsetting sublease income  if any 
these costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
settlement payments represent payments to be made in connection with a settlement and license agreement entered into in january these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the purpose of this table  purchase obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
in addition  we have purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated by operations and from the exercise of employee stock options  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
in february we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec that  when declared effective  will allow us to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of our class a common stock  shares of preferred stock or debt securities  or any combination of such securities  for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to million 
however  we have no immediate plans to raise capital under the universal shelf registration statement 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 

table of contents although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  volume price discounts and customer rebates  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors responses to our products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  the availability of sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials  litigation expenses  settlements and judgments  expenses related to our restructuring plans  the effectiveness of our expense and product cost control and reduction efforts  the level of cash generated from the net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  and general economic conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  including the effects of recent international conflicts and the general economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 

table of contents risk factors before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on broadcom  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our class a common stock may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those listed below and those identified throughout this risk factors section economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  our ability to secure sufficient capacity at third party semiconductor foundries and sufficient packaging materials from the third party subcontractors who assemble and test substantially all of our products  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies and products in our target markets  our ability to retain  recruit and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the positions and numbers  with the experience and capabilities  and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  the gain or loss of a key customer  design win or order  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  changes in our product or customer mix  the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our foundries  and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  the effects of public health emergencies  natural disasters  international conflicts and other events beyond our control  and changes in accounting rules  such as the proposed change regarding recording expenses for employee stock options and other stock based compensation 
we are beginning to derive a larger portion of our product revenue from our relatively newer markets such as the markets for wireless networking  dbs  cellular  dsl and pvr applications 
we expect these product lines to account for a higher percentage of our sales in the future 
these markets are immature and unpredictable  and we cannot assure you that these markets will develop into significant opportunities or that we will continue to derive significant revenue from these markets 
based on the limited amount of historical data available to us  it is difficult to predict our future revenue streams from and the sustainability of such newer markets 
additionally  rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas also make it difficult for us to estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we believe that we may become subject to some seasonality in demand for our solutions that are designed for use in consumer products  such as desktop and 
table of contents notebook computers  pdas  other wireless enabled consumer electronics  and satellite and digital cable set top boxes  which may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indicator of future performance 
continuing worldwide political and economic uncertainties may adversely impact our revenue and profitability 
in the last three years worldwide economic conditions have experienced a downturn due to slower economic activity  concerns about inflation and deflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and broadband communications markets  the lingering effects of the war in iraq  and recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity 
in addition  the lingering effects of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  a recurrence of sars or the outbreak of a new public health emergency could have a further adverse effect upon an already weakened world economy 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause us and foreign businesses to slow spending on our products and services  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles 
although recently we have seen some signs of recovery in the worldwide economy  we cannot predict the timing  strength and duration of any economic recovery  worldwide or in the broadband communications markets 
if the economy does not continue to recover  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
any such variations could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns 
these downturns are characterized by decreases in product demand  excess customer inventories  and accelerated erosion of prices 
these factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenue and in our results of operations 
any downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of this industry or the broadband communications markets to fully recover from downturns could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products 
accordingly  our operating results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause our stock price to decline 
if we fail to manage growth in our business effectively  we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our business could be materially and adversely affected 
to achieve our business objectives  we anticipate that we will need to continue to expand 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion in the past 
through internal growth and acquisitions  we significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce  from  employees as of december  to  employees as of december   including contract and temporary employees 
this past growth has placed  and any future growth is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
although we have recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system to help us improve our planning and management processes  we anticipate that we will need to continue to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  such as a new material requirements planning  or mrp  system and a new human resources management  or hrm  system  as well as additional procedures and controls and other internal management systems 
we also will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
if we are unable to accomplish these endeavors in a timely manner  we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our business could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we depend on six independent foundry subcontractors to manufacture substantially all of our current products  and any failure to secure and maintain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility 
six outside foundry subcontractors located in asia manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced due to strong demand 
in addition  a recurrence of sars or the occurrence of another public health emergency in asia could further affect the production capabilities of our manufacturers by resulting in quarantines or closures 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capacity at our existing foundries  or in the event of a quarantine or closure at any of these foundries  our revenues  cost of revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
additionally  in september two of our foundries principal facilities were affected by a significant earthquake in taiwan 
as a consequence of this earthquake  they suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired their wafer deliveries  which  together with strong demand  resulted in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide 
if any of our foundries experiences a shortage in capacity  or suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages  encounters financial difficulties or any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may need to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner 
even our current foundries need to have new manufacturing processes qualified if there is a disruption in an existing process 
we typically require several months to qualify a new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it 
if we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner  we may experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products 
because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity  we face several significant risks  including a lack of guaranteed wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of  or potential delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 
poor yields from our foundries could result in product shortages or delays in product shipments  which could seriously harm our relationships with our customers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a significant guaranteed level of production capacity with any of our foundries 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand  and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are  or that have long term agreements with our main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
this reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we use six independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor products  most of our components are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time  and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
also  our third party foundries typically migrate capacity to newer  state of the art manufacturing processes on a regular basis  which may create capacity shortages for our products designed to be manufactured on an older process 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries will be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields  or that our foundries will be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or at reasonable prices 
these and other related factors could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents although we may utilize new foundries for other products in the future  in using new foundries we will be subject to all of the risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to our current foundries 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  and if we are unable to accurately predict customer demand  our business could be seriously harmed 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
customers can generally cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
we currently do not have the ability to accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and unpredictable demand for their own products and they increasingly focus more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management 
in the recent past  our customers have begun requesting shipment of our products earlier than our normal lead times 
to meet these shortened lead times  we must place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand 
our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to or at all 
as a result  we would hold excess or obsolete inventory  which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
in addition  any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
furthermore  we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income 
we depend on third party subcontractors to assemble  obtain packaging materials for  and test substantially all of our current products 
if we lose the services of any of our subcontractors or if these subcontractors are unable to attain sufficient packaging materials  shipments of our products may be disrupted  which could harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not own or operate an assembly or test facility 
seven third party subcontractors located in asia assemble  obtain packaging materials for  and test substantially all of our current products 
because we rely on third party subcontractors to perform these functions  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance 
this lack of control has in the past resulted  and could in the future result  in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could delay shipments of our products or increase our manufacturing  assembly or testing costs 
in the recent past we and others in our industry experienced a shortage in the supply of packaging substrates that we use for our products 
if our third party subcontractors are unable to obtain sufficient packaging materials for our products in a timely manner  we may experience a significant product shortage or delay in product shipments  which could seriously harm our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity  we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner 
due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components 
any problems that we may encounter with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
however  even if we use these new subcontractors  we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above 

table of contents we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs  and we have designed most of our products to be manufactured in 
micron  
micron  
micron and 
micron geometry processes 
in the future  we expect to migrate some of our products to nanometer process technology 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our existing foundry relationships or develop new ones 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  we could experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses  all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
we may be unable to attract  retain and motivate key senior management and technical personnel  which could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel  including our co founder  chairman of the board and chief technical officer  henry samueli  phd  our president and chief executive officer  alan e 
ross  and other senior executives 
we do not have employment agreements with these executives  or any other key employees  that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of dr 
samueli  mr 
ross or certain other key senior management or technical personnel could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in january one of our co founders  henry t 
nicholas iii  phd  resigned from his positions as president and chief executive officer and decided not to stand for re election to our board of directors 
mr 
ross  who was serving as our chief operating officer at the time of dr 
nicholas resignation  assumed the responsibilities of president and chief executive officer 
the board of directors is continuing its efforts to identify a successor chief executive officer 
if we are unable to attract a suitable successor to mr 
ross or if we lose the services of mr 
ross prior to hiring his successor  our business could be seriously harmed 
we anticipate that the recruitment of a successor chief executive officer  and the adjustment to any changes implemented by such chief executive officer  will continue to require substantial attention of our board of directors and management personnel 
additionally  the officers who serve as vice presidents of our business groups are not long time broadcom employees  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them or that they will successfully implement our business plans within these business groups 
furthermore  our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel  particularly software engineers  digital circuit designers  rf and mixed signal circuit designers and systems applications engineers 
competition for these employees is intense 
stock options generally comprise a significant portion of our compensation packages for all employees  and the substantial decline in the price of our class a common stock over the past three years may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key employees 
in april and may we conducted a stock option exchange offer for the purpose of improving our ability to retain key employees 
however  we cannot be certain that the stock option exchange program will result in increased retention of those employees 

table of contents we have also modified our compensation policies by increasing cash compensation to certain employees 
a continuation of this shift in our compensation policies is likely to lead to increased operating expenses 
we cannot be certain that the changes in our cash compensation policies will improve our ability to attract  retain and motivate employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  our past workforce reductions could adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to growth opportunities 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to develop new semiconductor solutions for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our historical quarterly results have been  and we expect that our future results will continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and lower than anticipated manufacturing yields in the early production of such products 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  accurately define new products  timely complete and introduce new product designs  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the products of our customers into which our products will be incorporated  obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials  achieve high manufacturing yields  shift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration  and gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
in some of our businesses  our ability to develop and deliver next generation products successfully depends in part on access to information from companies that are competitors 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  we will be unable to attract new customers or retain our existing customers as these customers may transition to other companies that can meet their product development needs  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we will have difficulty selling our products if customers do not design our products into their product offerings or if our customers product offerings are not commercially successful 
our products are generally incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
as a result  we rely on equipment manufacturers to select our products to be designed into their products 
without these design wins  it becomes difficult to sell our products 
we often incur significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
additionally  in some instances  we are dependent on third parties to obtain or provide information that we need to achieve a design win 
some of these third parties may be competitors and  accordingly  may not supply this information to us on a timely basis  if at all 
once an equipment manufacturer designs a competitor s product into its product offering  it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk for the customer 
furthermore  even if an equipment manufacturer designs one of our products into its product offering  we cannot be assured that its product will be commercially successful or that we will receive any revenue from that product 
sales of our products largely depend on the commercial success of our customers products 
our customers are typically not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products if their own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to 
table of contents achieve design wins or that our customers equipment incorporating our products will ever be commercially successful 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
we sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
in addition  our target markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these broadband communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband communications markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
these rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards make it difficult to formulate a long term growth strategy because the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we anticipate 
we have in the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain  copy  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we hold over us patents and have filed over  additional us patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued 
even if a new patent is issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
as such  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
moreover  because we have participated in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on the adopted standards 
certain broadcom software as well as that of our customers may be derived from so called open source software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and or other third parties 
such open source software is often made available to us under licenses  such as the gnu general public license  or gpl  which impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software 
these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public  and or license such derivative works under a particular type of license  rather than the licenses customarily used to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  there is little or no legal precedent for interpreting the terms of 
table of contents certain of these licenses  including the determination of which works are subject to the terms of such licenses 
while we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software  in the event the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work  we could be forced to release the source code of that work to the public and or stop distribution of that work 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our network to misappropriate our proprietary information or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail to fulfill our obligations  including product supply obligations  under those agreements  and if we do not correct the failure within a specified time period 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of strategic customers into our own designs  and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
we are currently engaged in litigation  and we may have to engage in additional litigation in the future  to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this litigation has in the past been and will likely continue to be very expensive and time consuming 
additionally  any litigation can divert management s attention from the operation of the business  which could negatively impact our operations 
third party claims of infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and seriously harm our operating results 
in addition  any litigation required to defend such claims against us could result in significant costs and diversion of management and personnel resources 
companies in the semiconductor industry often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  in the past we have been engaged  and currently we are engaged  in litigation with parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
although we are defending the pending litigation vigorously  it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits 
in addition  we may be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
an adverse determination in any of these types of claims could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products  could increase our costs of production and could expose us to significant liability 
any of these claims may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or redesign certain products offered for sale or under development 
in addition  we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology and we may be liable for treble damages if infringement is found to have been willful 
we may also have to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and 
table of contents personnel resources to defend 
additionally  we have in the past sought and may in the future seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights and have granted and may in the future grant a license to certain of our intellectual property rights to a third party in connection with a cross license agreement or a settlement of claims or actions asserted against us 
however  we may not be able to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied in significant part on our strategic relationships with customers that are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our customers frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our sales would decline and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  the loss of a key customer could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue in the past from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales to hewlett packard and dell  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net revenue in sales to our five largest customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our net revenue in as compared with of our net revenue in we expect that a small group of key customers  the composition of which has varied over time  will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in and in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons  including the following most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty  our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect their decisions to purchase our products  our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products  and some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling 
table of contents prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets 
the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in the markets for digital cable and satellite set top boxes  hdtv  cable and dsl modems and residential gateways  high speed transmission and switching for local  metropolitan  wide area and storage networking  home and wireless networking  cellular and terrestrial wireless communications  voip gateway and telephony systems  broadband network and security processors  and system i o server solutions 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for some of our products 
in all of our target markets we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers who choose to develop their own silicon solutions 
we also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
existing or new competitors may also develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality  lower power requirements  greater levels of integration or lower cost 
increased competition has in the past and is likely to continue to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets 
in some of our businesses  we are dependent on competitors for information for the timely development of next generation products  and such information may not always be given to us on a timely basis  if at all 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline 
our acquisition strategy may be dilutive to existing shareholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
between january  and december  we acquired companies and certain assets of one other business 
we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combination transactions  strategic partnerships  and the purchase or sale of assets  including tangible and intangible assets such as intellectual property 
we also continually evaluate the performance and prospects of our various businesses and possible adjustments in our businesses to reflect changes in our assessment of their performance and prospects 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies 
we have in the past and may in the future experience delays in the timing and 
table of contents successful integration of an acquired company s technologies and product development through volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases 
furthermore  these challenges would be even greater if we acquired a business or entered into a business combination transaction with a company that was larger and more difficult to integrate than the typical size of the companies we have historically acquired 
furthermore  acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation and deferred compensation charges  and the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and certain purchased intangible assets  any of which could negatively impact our results of operations 
in connection with our transactions in which we used the purchase method of accounting  we recorded goodwill in the aggregate amount of approximately billion 
through the portion of that goodwill attributable to each acquisition generally was amortized over a month period from the date that the acquisition closed 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion in the third quarter of to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions 
effective january  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas and sfas in accordance with sfas we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in the second quarter of and billion in the fourth quarter of to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions 
we may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future 
in addition  in connection with these acquisitions we incurred deferred compensation charges generally related to the assumption of unvested stock options and restricted shares in the aggregate amount of approximately billion  which is being amortized over the period during which the relevant options or restricted stock may continue to vest 
we expect to record additional goodwill and deferred compensation in connection with future acquisitions 
any of these events could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 
acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves 
alternatively  we may issue equity or convertible debt securities in connection with an acquisition 
in february we filed an acquisition shelf registration statement on form s with the sec that  when declared effective  will enable us to issue up to million shares of our class a common stock in one or more acquisition transactions that we may make from time to time  although we have no immediate plans to issue common stock under the acquisition shelf registration statement 
any additional issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a common stock 
for example  as a consequence of the prior pooling of interests rules  the securities issued in nine of our prior acquisitions were shares of class b common stock  which have voting rights superior to our publicly traded class a common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
in the future  we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms  as the decline in the price of our class a common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions 
moreover  it may be difficult for us to successfully integrate any acquired businesses  assets  products  technologies or personnel  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or by borrowing money  but additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated by operations and from the exercise of employee stock options will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  
table of contents capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
in february we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec that  when declared effective  will allow us to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of our class a common stock  shares of preferred stock or debt securities  or any combination of such securities  for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to million 
however  we have no immediate plans to raise capital under the universal shelf registration statement 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a or class b common stock 
our efforts to develop new revenue sources and replace lost revenue sources for our serverworks business may not be successful 
our serverworks business has recently experienced design losses that were attributable  in part  to our ongoing inability to obtain required design information from a third party that is also a competitor 
these design losses led us to reduce our forecasts of future operating results for this business for periods beginning as early as the second quarter of  with the expectation of future loss of market share for this business 
we are now pursuing strategies to reposition serverworks and to develop alternative sources of revenue for the business 
we cannot assure you that these strategies will be successful 
if they are not successful  or if revenues from our other businesses do not increase as expected  our revenue or revenue growth rate and results of operations may be adversely affected 
as our international business expands  we are increasingly exposed to various legal  business  political and economic risks associated with our international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the united states 
in addition  approximately of our net revenue in was derived from sales to independent customers outside the united states 
such net revenue does not include revenue from products shipped to subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors that have headquarters in the united states even though such subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors are located outside of the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in we established an international distribution center in singapore that includes an engineering design center 
we also undertake design and development activities in belgium  canada  china  india  israel  the netherlands  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we intend to continue to expand our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad 
the recent war in iraq and the lingering effects of terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad  the resulting heightened security and the increasing risk of extended international military conflicts may adversely impact our international sales and could make our international operations more expensive 
international operations are subject to many other inherent risks  including but not limited to political  social and economic instability  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  natural disasters and public health emergencies  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows  trade and travel restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  
table of contents unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities or delayed revenue recognition  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of the factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales 
additionally  our operations may be impacted by sars related factors  including  but not limited to  disruptions at our third party manufacturers that are primarily located in asia  reduced sales in our international retail channels and increased supply chain costs 
if sars recurs or spreads to other areas  or other similar public health emergencies arise  our international sales and operations could be harmed 
we currently operate under tax holidays in certain foreign jurisdictions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to enjoy such tax holidays or realize any net tax benefits from such tax holidays 
moreover  the seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
our products typically have lengthy sales cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
in addition  our average product life cycles tend to be short and  as a result  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory that could adversely affect our operating results 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need three to more than six months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to more than nine months to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurances that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
in addition  anticipated sales could be materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products 
while our sales cycles are typically long  our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 

table of contents the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs  which could damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect the market acceptance of new products 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have recently experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contains defects or bugs  or has reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales or shipment of our products to our customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by us and our suppliers and customers  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  oems who purchase pc components may require that we assume liability for defects associated with products produced by their manufacturing subcontractors and require that we provide a warranty for defects or other problems which may arise at the system level 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options could adversely affect our results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board has announced its tentative decision to require companies to expense employee stock options in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  for financial reporting purposes  effective in such stock option expensing would require us to value our employee stock option grants pursuant to an option valuation formula  such as black scholes  and then amortize that value against our reported earnings over the vesting period in effect for those options 
we currently account for stock based awards to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas if we are required to expense employee stock options in the future  this change in accounting treatment would materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations as the stock based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings 
for an illustration of the effect of such a change on our recent results of operations  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may experience difficulties in implementing or enhancing new information systems 
we implemented a new erp information system to manage our business operations in the second quarter of and are in the process of enhancing this new system 
although the transition has proceeded to date without material adverse effects  the possibility exists that our migration to the new erp information system could adversely affect our disclosure controls and procedures or our operations in future periods 
we also intend to implement a new mrp information system and a new hrm system and the migration to these new systems could also disrupt our operations 
the process of implementing new information systems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner accept and process customer orders  receive inventory and ship products  invoice and collect receivables  place purchase orders and pay invoices  and all other business transactions related to the finance  order entry  purchasing  supply chain and human resource processes within the new erp  mrp or hrm systems 
any such disruption could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and the market price of our class a common stock 
three of the six primary independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our current products and our california facilities are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
two of the six outside foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices are located in taiwan and one such outside foundry is located in japan 
both taiwan and japan have 
table of contents experienced significant earthquakes in the past and could be subject to additional earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster in taiwan or japan could significantly disrupt our foundries production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located near major earthquake fault lines 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located  it could significantly disrupt our operations 
changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by the fcc  other federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets 
although current fcc regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products  they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services to their customers or other aspects of their business may impede sales of our products 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may  in turn  materially and adversely impact our business 
for example  in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
we and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere could also materially and adversely affect our business 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since january  our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of changes in our senior management  the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  continuing international conflicts and acts of terrorism  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  changes in accounting rules  particularly those related to the expensing of stock options  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related  semiconductor and other technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation  and as noted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have been sued in several purported securities class action lawsuits  which have been consolidated into a single action 
we and certain of our directors and officers have also been sued in purported shareholder 
table of contents derivative actions and other securities litigation 
although we believe that those lawsuits are without merit  an adverse determination could have a very significant effect on our business and results of operations  and could materially affect the price of our stock 
moreover  regardless of the ultimate result  it is likely that the lawsuits will divert management s attention and resources from other matters  which could also adversely affect the price of our stock 
our co founders  directors  executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders  and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval 
as of december  our co founders  directors  executive officers and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common stock  and the approval of most significant corporate transactions  including a merger  consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets 
in particular  as of december  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas iii  who is no longer an officer or director of the company  and dr 
henry samueli  our chairman of the board and chief technical officer  beneficially owned a total of approximately of our outstanding common stock and held of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
because of their significant voting stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions  and our shareholders will not be able to effect certain actions or transactions without the approval of one or both of these shareholders 
these actions and transactions include changes in control of our board of directors  mergers  and the sale of control of our company by means of a tender offer or otherwise  open market purchases or other purchases of our class a common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  we have in the past issued and may in the future issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  upon exercise of certain stock options  and for other purposes 
class b shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared with one vote per share in the case of our class a common stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote 
it is possible that the provisions in our charter documents  the exercise of supervoting rights by holders of our class b common stock  our co founders  directors and officers ownership of a majority of the class b common stock  and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock or additional shares of class b common stock may prevent or discourage third parties from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our class a common stock at a premium over the market price for this stock 
these factors may also materially and adversely affect voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock and the market price of our class a common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december  the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
our marketable debt securities  consisting of commercial paper  corporate and foreign notes and bonds  and us treasury and agency obligations  are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted 
table of contents for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
our investment policy for marketable debt securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than one year 
as of december  the carrying value and fair value of these securities were approximately million and million  respectively 
these securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our strategic equity investments are generally classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for our publicly traded investments 
we have also invested in privately held companies  the majority of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage  or in funds that invest in such companies 
we make investments in key business partners and other industry participants to establish important strategic relationships  expand existing relationships and achieve a return on our investment 
these investments are inherently risky  as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as such  we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
we realized a gain on the sale of one of our investments in a privately held company of approximately million in september this investment was previously written down by approximately million in september  representing at the time an other than temporary decline in the value of this security investment 
in september we performed impairment analyses and recorded impairment charges for certain of our strategic investments in privately held companies in the amount of approximately million  representing other than temporary declines in the value of these investments 
in we recorded a net gain of approximately million primarily due to the sale of one of our publicly traded investments and recorded losses of approximately million related to additional strategic investments 
as of december  the carrying and fair value of our strategic investments was approximately million 
the fair value of our marketable debt securities fluctuates based on changes in interest rates  however  given the short term maturities  we do not believe these instruments are subject to significant interest rate risk 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our marketable debt securities and long term debt exposure as of december  and  respectively  were as follows carrying maturity fair amount value in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate marketable debt securities weighted average interest rate carrying maturity fair amount value in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate marketable debt securities weighted average interest rate restricted marketable debt securities weighted average interest rate long term debt capital leases and other obligations weighted average interest rate
