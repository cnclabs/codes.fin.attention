table of contents results of operations the following tables present components of our consolidated income statement and segment information 
consolidated sales cost of sales gross profit sg a expenses amortization other ebit in thousands  except percents by segment pharmaceutical sales ebit ebit energy sales ebit ebit industrial sales ebit ebit total sales ebit ebit fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  sales for the fiscal year ended august  were million compared with million in fiscal foreign currency translation caused an increase in sales of million resulting in a sales decline of million on a constant dollar basis 
the decline in sales is a result of lower sales in our pharmaceutical segment offset by strengthening sales in our energy and industrial segments 
the pharmaceutical segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in a sales decline of million on a constant dollar basis 
the decline in sales volumes is a result of continued weak economic conditions in europe  which represents approximately of this segment s sales volume 
our sales were negatively affected by reduced capital spending by pharmaceutical companies due to general weakness in the capital goods markets in europe and the business consolidations within the pharmaceutical industry 
the consolidation of pharmaceutical companies has resulted in excess capacity as product lines are rationalized among facilities 
the excess capacity as a result of the consolidations is viewed as a short term issue because normal wear and tear on equipment will eventually lead to replacement and the consumption of pharmaceutical products is expected to continue to grow 
the energy segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in a sales increase of million on a constant dollar basis 
higher oil and natural gas prices and accelerated global demand are being reflected in higher rig count and capital equipment spending in this industry 
it is anticipated that these trends should continue through our fiscal 
table of contents the industrial segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this modest increase in sales is attributed to some improvement in the us industrial economy offset by lower spending for wastewater treatment projects by local municipalities 
ebit in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded costs of million related to the retirement of our former president and ceo and million for severance costs related to the closure of a reactor systems facility in italy 
the sales volume decline in constant dollars of had a negative impact on ebit of million 
the remaining decline in ebit is a result of price pressures in our pharmaceutical segment million  higher health care costs million and a shift in sales mix as aftermarket sales in our industrial segment were a lower percentage of sales relative to fiscal the pharmaceutical segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decline of million 
the severance costs of million related to the closure of a reactor systems facility in italy were reflected in this segment 
the sales decline of million on a constant dollar basis reduced ebit by million  while price pressures in europe negatively impacted ebit by another million 
these items were partially offset by our efforts to reduce both material and overhead costs in response to the lower sales volumes 
the energy segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the higher sales volumes caused ebit to increase by million 
this was partially offset by new product development costs and costs to establish operations in new markets such as kazakhstan and indonesia 
the industrial segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the aforementioned million increase in sales volumes only increased ebit by million because of a change in sales mix as the aftermarket business was a smaller percentage of fiscal sales 
in addition  higher health care costs of approximately million negatively impacted ebit in this segment 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was due to lower average debt levels resulting from cash flow generated in fiscal in addition  fiscal includes the full year interest savings from our interest rate swap instrument  whereas the interest rate swap was only in effect for approximately one quarter of fiscal our effective interest rate was in fiscal and in fiscal net income and net income per diluted share in fiscal were million and compared with million and in fiscal the lower net income is a result of the items mentioned above 
fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  sales for the fiscal year ended august  were million  an increase of million or over the prior fiscal year 
the impact of exchange rates  the translation of sales from non us operations into non us dollars  accounted for million of sales 
the pharmaceutical segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in a decrease of million on a constant dollar basis 
the decline in sales volumes is in both our romaco and reactor systems units and is due to weak market conditions in europe 
the energy segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal  an increase of million  or 
most of this increase in sales has occurred in the last quarter of our fiscal year and is due to higher rig counts as a result of higher crude oil and natural gas prices and increased sales in venezuela 
the industrial segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
our acquisition of tarby on november   accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining increase is a result of an improving industrial economic environment in north america in the latter part of our fiscal year 

table of contents ebit in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal the pharmaceutical segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decline of million 
of this decrease  million related to the aforementioned sales decrease in constant dollars of million  excluding the impact of exchange rates  with the remainder of the decline due to lower pricing in europe for glass lined reactor vessels 
the energy segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
two thirds of this increased ebit is a result of higher sales volumes  with the remaining increase coming from cost reduction programs implemented in fiscal that were fully realized in fiscal the industrial segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the tarby acquisition accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining increase in ebit is due to slightly higher sales volumes and cost saving measures undertaken in fiscal that were realized in fiscal interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was due to lower average debt levels resulting from cash flow generated in fiscal and our secondary stock offering in june of fiscal that raised net proceeds of million 
our effective interest rate was in fiscal and in fiscal net income and net income per diluted share in fiscal were million and compared with million and in fiscal the lower net income is a result of the items mentioned above  and the relatively larger decline in net income per share is a result of having million more average common shares outstanding as a result of the secondary stock offering in june of fiscal restructuring we have announced a restructuring plan of our pharmaceutical segment 
the restructuring plan is being initiated to improve the profitability of the pharmaceutical segment in light of the current worldwide economic conditions that are affecting this segment 
the restructuring activities will include the following plant closures one of two reactor systems facilities in italy  a reactor systems facility in mexico and the unipac facility of romaco in italy 
headcount reductions to support the reactor systems business reorganization and to bring the personnel costs in line with the current level of business 
headcount reductions at romaco with the unipac integration into the macofar facility and removal of duplicate administrative costs at other locations 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we will record expenses of approximately million in the first half of our fiscal year ending august  approximately to million of the costs relate to termination benefits as we reduce our workforce by approximately people 
the remaining costs primarily relate to the write down of inventory of discontinued products 
the total cash outlays in connection with the restructuring plan are estimated to be between and million 
we estimate that the restructuring plan will be substantially completed by the second quarter of fiscal the facilities that are being closed are currently owned by us and will be sold 
we expect the facility sales to generate approximately to million of cash proceeds which exceeds the recorded book value of these facilities by approximately to million 
the facilities are in excellent condition and are believed to be readily marketable  but we are unable to predict the specific timing of the sale of any one or all of the facilities 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operations was million compared with million in fiscal the lower cash flow from operations is a result of higher working capital because of higher orders and sales in the latter half of fiscal we expect our fiscal operating cash flow to be adequate to fund the fiscal year operating needs  scheduled debt services  shareholder dividend requirements and planned capital expenditures of approximately million 
our planned capital expenditures are related to additional production capacity  cost reductions and replacement items 
investing activities our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal the majority of our capital expenditures were for replacement of equipment 
financing activities we paid million to amend and extend our credit agreement in october credit agreement our bank credit agreement agreement provides that we may borrow on a revolving credit basis up to a maximum of million 
all outstanding amounts under the agreement are due and payable on october  interest is variable based upon formulas tied to libor or prime  at our option  and is payable at least quarterly 
at august   the weighted average interest rate for all amounts outstanding was 
indebtedness under the agreement is unsecured  except for guarantees by our us subsidiaries  the pledge of the stock of our us subsidiaries and the pledge of the stock of certain non us subsidiaries 
under this agreement and other lines of credit  we have million of unused borrowing capacity 
however  due to our financial covenants and outstanding standby letters of credit  we could only incur additional indebtedness of million 
we have million of standby letters of credit outstanding at august  these standby letters of credit are used as security for advance payments received from customers and future payments to our vendors 
we are currently in negotiations with our lenders to increase our borrowing capacity in light of the restructuring programs in process in our pharmaceutical segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer 
in instances where we have equipment installation obligations  the revenue related to the installation service is deferred until installation is complete 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty accruals  litigation  product liability  environmental accruals and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries we serve 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the market conditions for our products and the on hand quantities of inventory in relation to historical usage 
as of august  we have inventory valuation reserves of million 
the inventory upon which this reserve relates to is still on hand and will be sold or disposed of in the future 
the expected selling price of this inventory approximates its net book value  therefore there is no significant impact on gross margin when it is sold 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of estimated future taxable income and establishment of tax strategies 
future taxable income  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation  product liability and environmental reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill as of september   we adopted two new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
sfas no 
 business combinations  eliminated the pooling method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   and addressed the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
accordingly  we applied the provisions of sfas no 
to all business combinations initiated after june  we also adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective september  goodwill amortization ceased upon adoption of the standard  and the required impairment tests were performed 
results of these impairment tests have not generated any impairment loss to date 
goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  are performed at the end of our first quarter 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in our consolidated income statement 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us financial statements into non us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for all non us units 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 

table of contents pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
pension expense for fiscal and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in the plan s discount rate and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension expense 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense recorded for the funded pension plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at august  the discount rate used to value the liabilities of the principal us plan was 
we determine our discount rate based on the moody s aa corporate bond index and an actuarial yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent decrease in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of increasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable increase in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one half percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense by approximately million 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board issued staff position fas providing final guidance on accounting for the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
we adopted the provisions of fas during the year ended august  this resulted in a reduction in our accumulated postretirement benefit obligations apbo for the subsidy related to benefits attributed to past services of million 
the subsidy resulted in a reduction in our current period net periodic postretirement benefit costs for the year ended august  of million 
we have not incurred a reduction in current gross benefit payments and expect to receive subsidy payments beginning in fiscal year ended august  in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the adoption of financial interpretation no 
had no effect on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and over foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our us dollar net asset positions 
we also enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit and cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we also have market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   we had million in interest bearing debt obligations subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
we expect this balance in the debt profile to moderate our financing cost over time 
we are limited in our ability to refinance our fixed rate debt 
however  we have the ability to change the characteristics of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of balance 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively modifies a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
this agreement involves the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of underlying principal amounts 
the mark to market values of both the fair value hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligation were equal and recorded as offsetting gains and losses in current period earnings 
the fair value hedge qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness 
as a result  there was no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 
the interest rate swap agreement totals million  expires in and allows us to receive an effective interest rate of and pay an interest rate based on libor 
at august   million of our outstanding debt was at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and million was at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our debt at august  was approximately million 
the following table presents the aggregate maturities and related weighted average interest rates of our debt obligations at august  by maturity dates
