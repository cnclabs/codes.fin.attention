item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of essex property trust  inc essex or the company as of and for the years ended december   and this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview the company believes that its operating results have largely been a result of its business strategy of investing in submarkets that provide the greatest potential for rental growth at the lowest relative risk 
essex believes that its market research process  which includes an analysis of both metropolitan statistical areas msa s and submarkets  provides it with a distinct competitive advantage 
essex researches market data by reviewing data from private and government sources as well as information developed or verified by its field personnel 
essex then utilizes its proprietary research model to project market rent trends  allowing the company to allocate capital to the markets with the best risk adjusted return potential 
essex s research process begins with a macro economic analysis of various msa s  followed by an evaluation of the submarkets within that msa 
the objective of the economic research department is to estimate the amount of new demand for housing  comparing it to the number of single family and multifamily homes being constructed within a submarket 
historically  markets with demand for multifamily housing that is greater than supply generate increasing occupancy levels and growth in rents 
key components of essex s analysis are as follows job growth the company believes that quality job growth will lead to demand for multifamily and for sale housing 
based on a variety of considerations  the company estimates how the total demand for housing will be allocated between rental and for sale housing 
housing supply limited housing supply  both rental and for sale  is a very important factor in maintaining high occupancy levels  particularly in periods of recession or slow economic growth 
the company seeks to identify markets in which there is a low level of housing construction  measured as a percentage of existing housing stock 
cost of for sale housing the company prefers areas with relatively expensive for sale housing  which is usually caused by an insufficient amount of single family housing construction 
the company seeks to identify areas where the cost of rent is low relative to both median income levels and the cost of homeownership 
demographic trends the company evaluates areas with long term positive immigration and demographic trends  and areas that provide an attractive quality of life 
based on its evaluation of multifamily housing supply and demand factors  the company forecasts the occupancy and rent trends for its targeted submarkets  and actively seeks to expand its multifamily portfolio in the submarket with the greatest risk adjusted return 
by region  the company s operating and investment strategy are as follow southern california region at the time of the company s initial public offering ipo  the company had ownership interests representing of its multifamily units in this region 
following the ipo  the company  using its research process  determined that various markets in the southern california region were attractive for multifamily property investment and  the company  accordingly increased ownership in such markets 
as of december   we have ownership interests representing of our multifamily units in this region 
during  the region continued to perform well  with same store property revenues increasing versus the company expects this region to continue generating positive operating results in the near term 
northern california region as of december   the company has ownership interests representing of its multifamily units in this region 
several years of job losses have resulted in declining rents 
in  same store property revenues decreased versus the company expects market rents to remain flat in  which would result in same store property revenues to decline the company expects positive multifamily fundamentals in this region after as a result  the company will begin to increase its investment focus in this region 
pacific northwest region as of december   the company has ownership interests representing of its multifamily units in the region 
this region also lost jobs in  but at a lower rate as compared to the company s northern california region 
in  same store property revenues decreased versus the company expects job growth in this region in  and believes this region will generate a slight increase in same store property revenue versus the company expects positive multifamily fundamentals in this region after  and the company will begin to increase its investment focus in this region

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties  its investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  its notes receivables  and qualification as a reit 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from to years using the straight line method 
development costs include acquisition  direct and indirect construction costs  interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods 
maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred 
asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures  and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development 
local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable  the carrying amount is evaluated 
if the sum of the property s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property  then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges 
when the company determines that a property is held for sale  it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property 
the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 
the company assesses the carrying value of its notes receivables pursuant to fasb s sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
pursuant to sfas no 
 a note is impaired if it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest contractually due 
the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note s effective interest rate 
the company does not accrue interest when a note is considered impaired 
when ultimate collectibility of the principal balance of the impaired note is in doubt  all cash receipts on impaired notes are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been recovered and are recognized as interest income  thereafter 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  average financial occupancy rates of the company s multifamily same store properties properties consolidated by the company for each of the years ended december  and increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue 
actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions

based on our analysis of fin revised  we expect to consolidate essex management corporation emc and essex fidelity i corporation efc  effective march   as we are the primary beneficiary of these vies 
the total assets and liabilities of emc and efc  net of intercompany eliminations  were approximately  and  respectively  at december  it is reasonably possible that certain other entities through which and with which the company conducts business  including those described in notes c   and of the consolidated financial statements will be deemed to be vies under the provisions of fin revised and that we may be the primary beneficiary 
the company is continuing its evaluation of these other various entities  which currently it is uncertain if such entities would result in consolidation 
if such other entities are required to be consolidated pursuant to fin revised  the total assets and liabilities  net of intercompany balances would be  and  and an estimated maximum exposure to loss would be equal to the company s investments and commitments to invest in these entities of  as of december  the disclosures provided reflect management s understanding and analysis of fin revised based upon information currently available 
the company continues to evaluate and analyze the complex terms of this fin revised and the evaluation of the impact of fin revised on the company s consolidated financial statements is ongoing and is subject to change in the event additional interpretive guidance is provided by the fasb or others

sfas no

potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect the company s actual financial performance and may cause the company s future results to be different from past performance or trends 
these factors include those set forth under the caption risk factors in item i of this annual report on form k and the following economic environment both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which the company owns  manages and develops properties have been and continue to be in an economic downturn 
this has resulted in increased concessions and reductions in market rental rates 
the company s property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged downturn in the real estate markets in which the company operates 
although the company believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead  it is possible that further reductions in market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues  operating income  cash flows  and the market value of the company s shares 
a prolonged recession could also affect the company s ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable disposition prices 
interest rate fluctuations the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective 
however  current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with historic levels 
the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the company s variable interest rate debt see item a and notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company s ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the company s ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 
inflation inflationary increases would likely have a negative effect on property operating expenses and such increases may be at a greater rate than growth in property rental rates 
the company believes it effectively manages its property and other expenses  but realizes that higher annual rates of inflation could result in increases to operating expense 
failure to qualify as a reit we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
however  we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a reit or that we will continue to so qualify in the future 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates 
we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify 
this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability 
even if we continue to qualify as a reit  we will continue to be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
funds from operations funds from operations  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is generally considered by industry analysts as an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
generally  funds from operations adjusts the net income of equity reits for non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties  gains losses on sales of real estate and extraordinary items 
management considers funds from operations to be a useful financial performance measurement of an equity reit because  together with net income  cash flows  and the interest coverage ratio  funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the performance of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the reit s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to shareholders 
funds from operations also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined under gaap 
further  funds from operations as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of funds from operations 
the following table sets forth the company s calculation of funds from operations for  and for the year for the quarter ended ended income from continuing operations before gain on sale of real estate  minority interests  and discontinued operations   adjustments depreciation and amortization   depreciation and amortization unconsolidated co investments   minority interests   dividends to preferred stockholders series f   write off of series c preferred units offering costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows 
management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december  because interest rates  yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments 
management has estimated that the fair value of the company s  of fixed rate mortgage notes payable at december  is approximately  based on terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace 
for the years ended decemb er there after total fair value in thousands fixed rate debt       average interest rate variable rate libor debt 
  average interest rate  subject to interest rate caps 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates
