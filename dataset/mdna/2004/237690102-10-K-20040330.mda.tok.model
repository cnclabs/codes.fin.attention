the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
the following discussions and the section entitled business cautionary factors that may affect future results describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview in  our primary goal was to manage the business to achieve profitable operations  while developing and enhancing products to drive revenue and earnings growth 
our challenge continued to be the weak and uncertain economic environment with its limited capacity related demand and weak capital spending 
we expect that demand for capacity should improve  based on forecasted increased unit sales for the semiconductor industry  which should provide improved business opportunities for data i o 
the restructuring actions that were initiated in and continued in were completed in this brought our quarterly breakeven point down below the level of net sales that we were experiencing in  resulting in our turnaround and profitability 
we are continuing our efforts to balance increasing costs and strategic investments in our business with the level of demand and mix of business we expect 
we are focusing our research and development efforts in our strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated programming systems for the manufacturing environment  particularly extending the capabilities and support for our flashcore architecture and the proline roadrunner and ps families 
to better support our customers in their geographic areas and time zones  we have expanded device support operations in germany and india and are in the process of setting up a new device support center in shanghai  china 
our customer focus has been on strategic high volume manufacturers and programming centers and the combination of our newer products with the nand flash and microcontroller support to gain new accounts and break into new markets  such as microcontrollers for the automotive market 
we are in the process of setting up a new subsidiary in china  expanding our china operations to take advantage of the growth of manufacturing in china 
we also increased our efforts in to partner with the semiconductor manufacturers to better serve our mutual customers 
business restructuring progress during  we completed the restructuring that began during  which included actions taken to reduce our breakeven point and realign data i o with our market opportunities 
we required this operational repositioning because of the impact of the economic slowdown and the decline in capital spending across a high number of customer groups on general demand for programming equipment over the past few years 
at the end of  our quarterly breakeven point was approximately million in net sales with employees worldwide 
our breakeven point increased in  primarily due to cost increases resulting from the impact of the weaker dollar on foreign currency based costs and from personnel costs due to salary increases  incentive compensation and selective hiring of individuals with critical skills to help position us as the continuing technology leader in our market 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of  in connection with our actions to reduce our quarterly breakeven point from approximately million of net sales at the beginning of to approximately million at the end of we achieved most of these reductions by reducing our personnel from at the beginning of to at the end of during  we recorded restructuring charges of  in connection with a number of strategic restructuring actions to reduce our breakeven point 
this restructuring included the following a reduction in our global workforce from at the start of the year to at the end of  discontinuance or reallocation of numerous projects and activities not essential to our long term goals  streamlining activities to decrease discretionary marketing  distribution and promotional expenses  consolidation of numerous functions across the organization to create a team  which was more productive and able to respond faster to global customer needs  and closure of a facility in germany and moving our operations to other locations within data i o 
at december  all restructuring expenses associated with the activities detailed above had been paid and the excess expense accrual of  was reversed during critical accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  data i o evaluates our estimates  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  contingencies such as litigation  and contract terms that have multiple elements and other complexities typical in the telecommunications equipment industry 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
data i o believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition sales of our semiconductor programming equipment products requiring installation by us that is other than perfunctory are recorded when installation is complete  or at the later of customer acceptance or installation  if an acceptance clause is specified in the sales terms 
we recognize revenue from other product sales at the time of shipment 
we record revenue from the sale of service and update contracts as deferred revenue and we recognize it on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically one year 
we establish a reserve for sales returns based on historical trends in product returns and estimates for new items 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we base the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
inventory provisions we base inventory purchases and commitments upon future demand forecasts and historic usage 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  data i o may be required to increase our inventory provision adjustments and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals data i o accrues for warranty costs based on the expected material and labor costs to fulfill our warranty obligations 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims  which are higher than our historical experience  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
results of continuing operations net sales in thousands net sales by product line change change non automated programming systems    automated programming systems    totals    net sales by location united states    of total international    of total vs 
data i o experienced a turnaround in sales during  with a resurgence in sales of automated system products 
in particular  automated systems aftermarket products and ps flashcore and related upgrades  which were new in  drove the sales growth 
our non automated systems continued a trend of declining sales in older products  however  flashpak  which was new in  grew in  partially offsetting the decline 
also contributing to the non automated system decline was the loss of a low cost programmer line 
ice technology  our former supplier of the line  ceased business 
in  sales related to the ice technology products were approximately  compared to  in international sales grew  particularly in europe  while sales in the us market continued to decline 
the us dollar continued to weaken in  which we believe assisted our export sales  due to increased buying power of foreign currencies and the favorable effect of currency translation for sales denominated in foreign currency  and in particular the euro 
we see a continuing trend in migration of customers moving manufacturing operations to low cost geographies  thereby increasing international sales opportunities 
the weakened us dollar  especially compared to the euro  is expected to continue to assist our export sales 
we are continuing the transition to a common programming architecture for all of our products 
this allows us to consolidate device support on a single platform and provides substantial cost benefits to data i o 
the recently introduced ps flashcore automated programming system incorporates this common architecture 
in  we also introduced nand and microcontroller support flashcore architecture  the tf tray feeder system  and a version of our proline roadrunner designed for panasonic machines 
we expect these products to increase our revenues  however  partially offsetting this increase is the trend of declining sales of our older product lines 
vs 
data i o sales declined for the year compared to however  for the third and fourth quarters of  sales increased over the same quarters in we attribute the overall decline to the continued economic downturn  especially in capital spending 
sales declined in all product categories  but the declines were offset in part by increased sales from our proline roadrunner and new flashpak product lines 
sales declined in both in the us and international markets with the americas and europe declining the most 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net sales vs 
gross margins increased in both dollars and as a percentage of sales for compared to the increase in gross margin dollars was due to both the increase in revenue dollars as well as the savings related to our restructuring actions 
the restructuring efforts lowered our annual breakeven point by implementing cost reductions as well as lowering inventory reserve charges compared to the continued product mix shift towards higher margin automated systems aftermarket continued to be a favorable factor in vs 
gross margin decreased in dollars due primarily to the decline in sales volume 
gross margin increased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the savings from the restructuring and implementation of cost reductions  as well as lower inventory reserve and warranty charges 
the product mix towards additional proline roadrunner and related aftermarket products also improved the gross margin as a percentage of sales 
the restructuring efforts lowered our breakeven point by bringing cost and operation expenditures  primarily personnel reductions  in line with the revenue levels we experienced at the end of research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales vs 
research and development r d spending for as compared to declined both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
this was again due to the restructuring actions  primarily personnel reductions and cost control efforts taken over the past two years 
during  data i o s r d focused on the flashcore architecture  expanding its capability to address newer technologies like nand flash support for m systems diskonchip technology as well as microcontroller device support 
new products in the ps family of automated systems included the ps flashcore  the tf tray feeder system and  introduced in early  the ps flashcore 
also  we released a proline roadrunner version for panasonic machines 
vs 
r d spending for as compared to declined both in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
this was due primarily to the lower headcount related to our restructuring actions during and during  data i o s r d focused on the new flashpak gang programming system and ps flashcore automated programming system  which integrated the programming architecture first introduced in the proline roadrunner 
we also released the following new products proline infinity  a proline roadrunner utilizing an automated handler  proline roadrunner variable capacity options  tf tray feeder system  and high insertion socket adapters 
we believe it is essential to invest in r d to significantly enhance our existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
we are focusing our r d efforts in our strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated programming systems for the manufacturing environment  particularly extending the capabilities and support for our flashcore architecture and the proline roadrunner 
in  we expect to add personnel and project related costs  so r d spending is expected to increase in selling  general and administrative in thousands change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales vs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by  in versus the prior year due primarily to the restructuring actions and reduced marketing expenses 
partially offsetting this decrease was our increased facility costs due to increased rent and loss of a sub tenant  profit based bonuses  and increased selling costs due to currency translation with the weaker us dollar and commissions 
vs 
sg a spending decreased by million in versus the prior year due primarily to the restructuring actions 
we reduced our expense by lowering our bad debts reserve due to collection of accounts receivable  incurring less retirement plan costs and lower commissions  partially offsetting these reductions were higher rent and insurance costs 
interest in thousands change change interest income interest expense vs 
interest income for increased as compared to primarily due to the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
vs 
interest income for decreased as compared to primarily due to the reduction in interest rates that occurred during and income taxes in thousands income tax expense benefit vs 
and vs 
income tax expense in all years relates to foreign income taxes 
for financial reporting purposes  data i o established tax valuation reserves against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty relating to the realization of such asset values 
we had valuation allowances of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates of exchange during the year 
we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of   and  in  and  respectively 
the transaction losses resulted primarily from sales by our german subsidiary to our main customers  which were invoiced in us dollars 
we hedge our foreign currency exposure on sales of inventory and certain loans to our foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign exchange contracts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in thousands change change working capital      in  cash and marketable securities increased by  primarily resulting from funds generated by operations 
key elements of working capital changes reflected the increase in business inventories increased by  accounts receivable increased by  and accounts payable and accrued expenses together increased  the increase in accounts receivable also reflects the longer collection period typically associated with international sales 
we estimate that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment during are planned to be approximately  although we expect to make such expenditures  we had no significant outstanding purchase commitments at december  such expenditures are expected to be funded by existing and internally generated funds or lease financing 
as a result of our significant product development  customer support  and selling and marketing efforts  data i o has required substantial working capital to fund our operations 
over the last few years  we restructured our operations to lower our costs and operating expenditures to lower our breakeven point  preserve our cash position and return to profitable operations  as reflected in our results 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least december  any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  liquidity  or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and or seek additional financing 
aggregate contractual obligations and commitments data i o has purchase obligations for inventory and production costs as well as other obligations such as capital expenditures  service contracts  marketing  and development agreements 
arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty  and with short notice  typically less than days 
any amounts reflected on the balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table below 
data i o has no long term debt 
data i o has commitments under non cancelable operating leases and other agreements  primarily for factory and office space  with initial or remaining terms of one year or more as follows for the years ending december  in thousands purchase operating obligations leases and thereafter total   share repurchase program under a previously announced share repurchase program  data i o is authorized to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
we may execute these purchases through open market purchases at prevailing market prices  through block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions  and we may commence or discontinue at any time 
as of december   data i o has repurchased  shares under this repurchase program at a total cost of approximately million 
data i o has not repurchased shares under this plan since the second quarter of  although it still has the authority to do so 
new accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations and  during  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
the adoption of sfas nos 
and during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf released issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  applicable to data i o for arrangements entered into beginning in fiscal data i o records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
as such  the adoption of eitf no 
during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus opinion on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement should be allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with different provisions if the fair value of all deliverables are not known or if the fair value is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  entities may elect to report the change as a cumulative effect adjustment in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes 
data i o has adopted the provisions of the statement  which has had no material impact 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin interprets arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  as amended by fasb statement no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  which requires the preparation of consolidated financial statements when one entity has a controlling financial interest in a second entity 
fin specifies disclosures that are required for financial statements issued after january  but prior to the effective date of the interpretation for entities created before february  and interests in those entities acquired before that date  as well as disclosures that will be required for financial statements of primary beneficiaries and others with variable interests in variable interest entities issued after the effective date 
the fasb has published a revision to interpretation to clarify some of the provisions of fin and to exempt certain entities from its provisions 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position  as we do not have variable interest entities 
in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under statement data i o has adopted the provisions of the statement  which has had no material impact 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of sfas no during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk with respect to our foreign currency exchange rate risk  we currently use only foreign currency hedge derivative instruments  which  at a given date  are not material 
however  data i o is exposed to interest rate risks 
we generally invest in high grade commercial paper with original maturity dates of twelve months or less and conservative money market funds to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk on our marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale as of december  and december  we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of these financial instruments is not material
