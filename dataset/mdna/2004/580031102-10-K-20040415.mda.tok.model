item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section of the annual report on form k discusses the comparative year over year results of our operations  our liquidity and financial condition  our risk management practices and our critical accounting policies 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in sections f through f of this document 
overview change of fiscal year on january   we changed our fiscal year end to january  from december we believe that the twelve months ended december  and provide a meaningful comparison to the twelve months ended january  there are no factors  of which we are aware  seasonal or otherwise  that would impact the comparability of information or trends  if results for the twelve months ended january  and were presented in lieu of results for the twelve months ended december  and references in this discussion to fiscal represent the twelve months ended january  references to fiscal and represent the twelve months ended december  and revenue growth and competitive industry our revenue for the fiscal year ended january  represented a increase over fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year this year over year revenue growth was driven by strong demand for our new intrepid tm  sphereon tm and eclipse director and switch products  as well as increased sales of our software and services products 
in addition  we broadened our channel mix with the addition of hds as a greater than customer and initial sales to two new oems  sun and stk 
this revenue growth has occurred while the market for our san products and solutions has grown more competitive with a the entrance of new competitors into our market  b pricing pressures resulting from an increase in competitive products and solutions  c challenges to our direct assist sales model  and d anticipated competition from our own storage oem partners through their recent acquisitions of  or alliances with  competitive software management products and or application providers that would utilize the intelligence in the network 
these market conditions present unique risks and uncertainties in a number of respects 
in particular  we anticipate continued lengthened sales cycles and downward pricing pressures that could negatively impact our revenue growth rate 
moreover  revenue growth in is dependent on the introduction of our new products 
we are currently proceeding with the development of new products  which incorporate the new technologies from our acquisitions of nishan and sanera 
in addition  we are taking action to continue sales of existing products acquired in connection with our acquisition of nishan 
as with any product introduction  we face risks in the design  testing  qualification and market acceptance our new products 
some of the products we are developing may be more complex and feature rich than our current products  and some of the development on those products was undertaken externally prior to the nishan and sanera acquisitions 
if we fail to timely introduce new products  or if there is no demand for these or our current products  we may experience a decline in revenue 
in addition to the recent increased competition in the industry  we have experienced a migration in the buying patterns of our customers from configured director products to non configured product sales including our switch products  port cards  and our flexport upgrades 
our oem and reseller partners may purchase certain of these component products ahead of end user demand  which could reduce subsequent purchases by those partners 
variations in the buying patterns of our customers would limit our ability to assemble  test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter and could cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenue or earnings 
moreover  an unexpected decline in revenue without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses could intensify the impact of these factors on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions on september   we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of nishan  a provider of multi protocol native ip storage switching solutions that builds open storage networking products based on ip and ethernet  both international networking standards 
on september   we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of sanera  a producer of intelligent director class switching platform technologies 
the results of operations discussed below reflect the operating results of nishan and sanera from the dates of acquisition 
on august   the company purchased million shares of preferred stock of aarohi communications aarohi 
at january   this represented approximately of the total outstanding shares of aarohi 
the shares were acquired at a total cost of million 
approximately million of this purchase price was determined to represent in process research and development and  as such  management of the company has expensed this amount during fiscal year in addition to the equity investment  we have entered into a non exclusive supply arrangement with aarohi to purchase their asic chip for inclusion in the company s new product launches when  and if  aarohi s product becomes generally available 
we have recorded our share of aarohi s net loss of approximately  from the date of purchase through january  restructuring activities in january  we announced that we were taking certain cost improvement actions  which included a workforce reduction and facility consolidation 
as a result  in the fiscal fourth quarter of  the company recorded an approximate million restructuring charge related to the reduction in workforce 
in addition  we expect to incur an approximate million restructuring charge in our fiscal first quarter of  primarily related to a facilities closure  as well as additional severance costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended january  years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative acquired in process research development and other acquisition related costs amortization of deferred compensation restructuring charges operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit loss before equity in net loss of affiliated company equity in net loss of affiliated company net loss revenues year ended january  years ended december  in millions product revenue software and service revenue other our revenue for the year ended january  was million  which represented a increase over fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year this increase in revenue reflects strong demand for our switching and software products 
although we continue to see solid end user demand and increased year over year revenue for our products and solutions  the on going competitive marketplace is expected to create a challenging sales environment for the foreseeable future 
given the entrance of new competitors and products in our industry  we anticipate longer sales cycles and price declines that could negatively impact our revenue growth rate 
product revenue of million for fiscal year was a increase over fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year this revenue increase was generated from the increased demand in our storage products  in particular our port intrepid tm series director and flexport sphereon tm fabric switch that were introduced in the last half of our fiscal year revenue was negatively impacted by the unfavorable economic conditions and suppressed it storage and infrastructure spending  in particular in the high end director market and our transition from gb to gb products in the first half of this environment had a particularly negative effect on our product revenue which declined from fiscal year levels 
our new product introductions in the last half of  however  were widely received with higher than expected demand and revenue 
software and service revenue of million for fiscal year was a increase over fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year this revenue growth is due to continued revenue growth from all of our software products  in particular our sanavigator and santegrity software 
a significant portion of our software revenue is generated from sales of our enterprise fabric connectivity manager  or efcm  software product 
other revenues for the year  including service fees earned under an escon service agreement with emc  were million in fiscal year this represents a increase from fiscal year and a increase from fiscal year this increase reflects the growth in maintenance fees  which outpaced the decline in service fees related to the escon products 
we continue to realize increased attached rates of our extended maintenance contracts to sales of our switching and software solutions 
we anticipate that service revenue from emc under the escon service agreement will continue to decrease in future years 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with the largest storage oems 
for the year ended january   approximately of our total revenue came from emc  compared to and for fiscal years and respectively 
ibm contributed approximately of our revenue for fiscal year compared to and for fiscal years and  respectively 
in addition  in hds became our third largest oem customer and contributed approximately of total revenue for the year ended january  mcdata solutions are offered by other major storage and system vendors  including dell  hp  stk and sun 
in addition to our storage and system vendors  we have relationships with many resellers  distributors and systems integrators 
expanding our reseller  distributor and system integrator channels into small medium enterprise sme and vertical markets will be a strategic focus for us as we continue to expand our business  however  the level of sales to any single customer may vary and the loss of any one significant customer  or a decrease in the level of sales to any significant or group of significant customers  could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
given the dependencies on our limited number of oem resellers combined with an increasingly competitive environment  we may experience continued adverse price pressures at critical times near the end of the fiscal quarters 
domestic and international revenue was approximately and of our total revenue  respectively  for the fiscal year ended january  for the year ended december   domestic and international revenue was approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   domestic and international revenue was approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customers to which our products are shipped 
international revenues primarily consist of sales to customers in western europe and the greater asia pacific region 
included in domestic revenues are sales to certain oem customers who take possession of our products domestically and then distribute these products to their international customers 
in addition  included in revenues from western europe are sales to certain oem customers who take possession of our products in distribution centers designated for international bound product and then distribute these products among various international regions 
our mix of international and domestic revenue can  therefore  vary depending on the relative mix of sales to certain oem customers 
the increase in international revenues as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year was the result of a large domestic order reduction by emc during the first quarter of that year associated with the technology transition to gb products 
gross profit gross profit for the fiscal year was compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the significant increase in our gross margin was the result of strong revenue growth from our higher margin switching and software products as well as an improved mix of sales to our channel partners 
additionally  during fiscal year and  we incurred significant inventory related charges of million and million respectively 
these charges were generated primarily from our transition to multiple product lines and quality problems on component parts 
we have significantly reduced inventory costs with the implementation of our outsource focused manufacturing model  which was completed during fiscal year operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal year  compared with million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the approximate million  or  increase from fiscal was primarily attributable to retention bonuses and incremental spending associated with our acquisitions  reductions in capitalized software costs  increases in personnel costs  non recurring engineering charges  and depreciation related to engineering and test equipment and the new engineering building occupied in the second half of capitalized software costs were approximately million  million and  for the  and fiscal years  respectively 
capitalized software development costs have decreased in conjunction with the varying stages of development of our application software  our new director and switch products and the related firmware software 
we anticipate the level of spending for the design  testing and qualification of our products to increase over prior years levels as we continue to broaden our product offerings and integrate the personnel and technology of nishan and sanera 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal year compared with million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
increases in sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to increased salaries  commissions and travel costs associated with increased revenues 
in addition  demonstration equipment and marketing costs associated with the completion of two new oem contracts as well as market development activities with our partners increased our overall sales and marketing expenses 
we believe that selling and marketing expenses will increase as we grow our sales force to assist our channel partners and increase our contact with end user customers to create product pull through our channels 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal year  compared to million and million for fiscal year and  respectively 
amortization expense for purchased intangible assets increased approximately million as a result of our acquisitions of sanera and nishan 
in addition  we experienced increased personnel costs  equipment and facilities costs while realizing overall reductions in bad debt and legal expenses 
expenses for fiscal year included significant legal expenses related to the costs of litigating brocade patent infringement lawsuit see item  legal proceedings and million in charges related to the termination of a collateralized lease and the disposal of fixed assets 
amortization expense will continue to increase in fiscal year as a full year of nishan and sanera intangible asset amortization will be reflected 
acquired in process research and development ipr d and other acquisition related costs 
in connection with our equity investment in aarohi and our acquisition of nishan in september  a portion of the respective purchase prices was allocated to ipr d 
this ipr d was expensed at the time of purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative use existed 
the ipr d charge for fiscal year totaled million 
in connection with our acquisition of sanavigator in fiscal  we incurred non recurring acquisition costs and integration related charges 
additionally  a portion of the sanavigator purchase price was allocated to ipr d 
this ipr d was expensed at the time of purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative use existed 
the ipr d charge totaled million for the year ended december  the other acquisition related charges recorded during the year ended december   related primarily to one time consideration paid for the completion of ongoing employment arrangements with sanavigator employees 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of deferred compensation 
we have recorded deferred compensation in connection with class b stock options granted prior to our august  initial public offering and restricted class b stock grants granted through our equity incentive plans 
in connection with our acquisitions during fiscal  we issued approximately million shares of class b restricted common stock with vesting periods ranging from to months 
in addition   shares vested immediately upon the retention of employees at nishan and sanera and were fully expensed 
we are amortizing all deferred compensation on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the applicable options and stock awards  resulting in amortization expense of million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year of which approximately   and  was included in cost of revenue  respectively 
deferred compensation expense levels fluctuate with the class b option and restricted stock award activity 
additional grants of these awards under existing compensations plans  future plans or through acquisitions could increase the level of deferred compensation expense 
restructuring charges 
in january  we announced that we were taking certain cost improvement actions  which included a workforce reduction and facility consolidation 
as a result  in the fiscal fourth quarter of  the company recorded an approximate million restructuring charge related to the reduction in workforce 
in addition  we expect to incur an approximate million restructuring charge in the fiscal first quarter  primarily related to a facilities closure  as well as additional severance costs 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consisted primarily of interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and various investment holdings 
interest income was million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in income from levels reflects the decline in interest rates during and fiscal years 
these declines offset the effects of higher cash and investment balances resulting from cash generated from operations and the net proceeds from convertible subordinated notes that were issued in february see note convertible subordinated debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the average rate of return on investments for the year ended january  was compared to for fiscal year  and for fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended january  compared with  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense represents the interest cost associated with our convertible subordinated notes issued in february in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that has the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the notes so that the interest payable on the majority of the notes effectively becomes variable based on the six month libor minus basis points 
the reset dates of the swap are february and august of each year until maturity on february  the six month libor setting for the swap was during the fiscal year  creating a rate of approximately minus  which is effective until february  this rate significantly reduced our overall interest expense during this period 
on february   the six month libor setting was reset to  resulting in a rate of approximately minus  which is effective until august  significant increases in interest rates in future periods could significantly increase interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
during the fiscal year we recorded a non cash charge of million to create a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
generally  the effective tax rate is determined by the relationship between pre tax book income or loss and certain amounts which are reported differently between the financial statements and the tax return 
during  the tax rate is favorably impacted primarily by the settlement of tax items related to previous years  the deductibility of costs associated with our convertible subordinated debt  and the research tax credit 
the tax rate is unfavorably impacted by deferred compensation and the write off of the ipr d related to aarohi  as well as by the non cash charge for the valuation allowance 
during  the tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by tax exempt interest and the research tax credit 
the tax rate was unfavorably impacted by deferred compensation 
during  the tax rate was favorably impacted primarily by tax exempt interest and the benefit attributable to export sales 
the tax rate was unfavorably impacted by deferred compensation 
a full valuation allowance was also created in fiscal against acquired deferred tax assets for million and against deferred tax assets relating to tax benefits recorded directly to shareholders equity for million 
neither of these items resulted in a current charge to income tax expense 
the valuation allowance related to acquired deferred tax assets resulted in an increase in goodwill 
if this portion of the valuation allowance is released in subsequent periods  goodwill will decrease by a like amount and we will record a charge to tax expense when the related deferred tax asset is realized 
if the valuation allowance charged to shareholders equity is released in subsequent periods  shareholders equity will increase by a like amount and we will record a charge to tax expense when the related deferred tax asset is realized 
liquidity and capital resources in summary  our cash flows were in thousands year ended january  years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities we invest excess cash predominantly in debt instruments that are highly liquid  of high quality investment grade  and predominantly have maturities of less than three years with the intent to make such funds readily available for operating purposes  including expansion of operations and potential acquisitions or other transactions 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments  including restricted cash  of million compared to approximately million as of december  cash provided by operating activities of million for primarily consists of our net loss adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  in process r d charges related to our acquisitions  deferred compensation  deferred taxes and inventory related charges offset by approximately million of changes in working capital and other activities 
working capital changes included an increase in accounts receivable balances of approximately million  reflecting increases related to our revenue growth particularly  in the last month of the fiscal fourth quarter 
days sales outstanding dso has decreased in to days compared to days in this reflects the impact of the change in fiscal year and increased level of accounts receivable collection 
we believe that dso may increase in as compared to as we see the linearity of our sales shift towards the third month of our fiscal quarters and as our channel mix continues to diversify 
our cash flows from operations were impacted by the growth in deferred revenue balances of approximately million in representing primarily increased sales of extended maintenance contracts attached to sales of our hardware and software products 
in addition  the growth in deferred revenue reflects deferred service fee revenue related to our escon agreement with emc 
from fiscal year to  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher revenues and a lower net loss before income taxes 
cash provided by operating activities in of million consisted primarily of the net loss adjusted for non cash charges of approximately million offset by approximately million used by working capital and other activities 
from fiscal year to  the increase in cash from operations was primarily a result of large inventory purchases in and larger income tax payments from our profitable fiscal year 
cash provided by operating activities in of approximately million consisted primarily of a net loss of approximately million adjusted for non cash items of approximately million and approximately million used by working capital and other activities 
cash used in investing activities in of approximately million was primarily attributable to cash used in acquisitions and purchases of equity investments of million  cash used to purchase net of sales and maturities investments in marketable securities during the year  cash used to secure restricted investments related to our interest rate swap transaction of approximately million  and capital expenditures totaling approximately million 
cash used in investing activities increased from to primarily as a result of the acquisitions of sanera and nishan  as well as increased net purchases of marketable securities related to higher cash balances available for investing from our issuance of convertible subordinated notes in february reduced spending for capital expenditures in from offset these increases 
cash used in investing activities in of approximately million was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million  contributed to by our completion and occupation of our office and engineering building 
the cash purchases were offset by proceeds from sales and maturities net of purchases of marketable securities for approximately million 
cash used for investing activities decreased in from primarily as a result of cash used for acquisitions in  as well as net purchases of investments in  compared to net proceeds from investments in cash used in investing activities in of approximately million was primarily attributable to cash used in acquisitions of million  capital expenditures totaling approximately million and net purchases net of sales and maturities of investments of million 
cash provided by financings in of million was primarily due to proceeds from issuance of convertible subordinated notes of million in principal amount  with proceeds of million and proceeds from the issuance of stock related to our stock option and employee purchase plans of million 
the convertible subordinated notes mature in february  unless converted into mcdata common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain conversion price adjustments 
upon conversion  mcdata has the right to deliver cash  stock or a combination of both 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the issuance of convertible subordinated notes 
offsetting these net proceeds were the use of million of those proceeds to enter into share option transactions  cash used for payments made on notes payable and capital lease obligations of approximately million  and million of cash used to repurchase common stock under our stock buy back program 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to the company s repurchase of common stock 
cash used in financing activities in of  was primarily due to principal payments on capital leases of million offset by proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities in of million was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million offset by payments on our capital lease obligations of million 
commitments the company has contracted with sanmina sci systems  inc ssci and solectron corporation solectron collectively  contract manufacturers for the manufacture of printed circuit boards and box build assembly and configuration for specific multi protocol directors and switches 
the agreements require us to submit purchasing forecasts and place orders sixty calendar days in advance of delivery 
at january   our commitment with the contract manufacturers for purchases over the next sixty days totaled million 
additionally  the contract manufacturers have outstanding purchase commitments related to materials that have been ordered on our behalf 
we may be liable for materials that the contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf if our actual requirements do not meet or exceed our forecasts and those materials cannot be redirected to other uses 
at january   we had recorded obligations of approximately million primarily related to materials purchased by our contract manufacturers for certain end of life and obsolete material used to manufacture our products 
we do not expect the remaining commitments under these agreements to have a continued material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in february  the company sold million of convertible subordinated notes due february  see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the notes are convertible into our class a common stock at conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes aggregate of approximately million shares or per share  subject to certain conversion adjustments 
upon a conversion  the company may choose to deliver shares of our class a common stock  or  in lieu of shares of our class a common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of class a common stock 
we are required to pay interest on february and august of each year  beginning august  debt issuance costs of million are being amortized over the term of the notes 
the amortization of debt issuance costs will accelerate upon early redemption or conversion of the notes 
the net proceeds remain available for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  the company entered into share option transactions using approximately million of proceeds 
as part of these share option transactions  the company purchased options that cover approximately million shares of class a common stock  at a strike price of 
the company also sold options that cover approximately million shares of class a common stock  at a strike price of 
the net cost of the share option transactions was recorded against additional paid in capital 
these share option transactions are intended to give the company the option to mitigate dilution as a result of the notes being converted to common shares up to the price per common share and mitigate dilution if the share price exceeds at that time 
should there be an early unwind of either of the share option transactions  the amount of cash or net shares potentially received or paid by the company will be dependent on then existing overall market conditions  the stock price  the volatility of the stock  and the amount of time remaining until expiration of the options 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that has the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the notes so that the interest payable on the majority of the notes effectively becomes variable based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor minus basis points 
the reset dates of the swap are february and august of each year until maturity on february  the six month libor setting for the swap at january  was  creating a rate of approximately minus  which was effective until february  on february   the six month libor setting was reset to  resulting in a rate of approximately minus  which is effective until august  significant increases in interest rates could significantly increase the interest expense we are obligated to pay to holders of the notes in future periods 
the swap was designated as a fair value hedge and  as such  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument  as well as the fully offsetting gain or loss on the notes attributable to the swap  were recognized in earnings 
at january   the fair value of the interest rate swap had decreased from inception to  and is included in other long term liabilities 
corresponding to this change  the carrying value of the notes has decreased by  we are also required to post collateral based on changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap 
this collateral  in the form of restricted cash  was million at january  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations including interest expense and commitments as of january  in thousands total less than year years more than years convertible subordinated debt non cancelable operating leases non cancelable purchase agreements capital leases  including interest total contractual obligations long term cash availability we believe our existing cash  short term and long term investment balances  and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements at least through the next twelve months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development of new products and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
inflation we believe that our revenue and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the last three fiscal years 
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this form k 
critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of mcdata s board of directors 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  products are delivered or services rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is assured 
in instances when any one of these four criteria is not met  we will defer recognition of revenue until all the criteria have been met 
with respect to revenue from our configured products  we request evidence of sell through from our oem and distributor partners prior to recognizing revenue 
in situations where our oem and distributor partners refuse to provide sell through information when requested  but all the criteria under sab as discussed above have been met  we recognize revenue for such configured products 
these configured products represent high value  customized solutions of directors  cabinets and various combinations of port cards ordered by our sales partners as required by the end user 
non configured products and components  such as our switch products  port cards  and flexport upgrades  are recognized as revenue when the criteria for sab as discussed above have been met  generally at time of shipment 
revenue for both configured and non configured products and components is reduced for estimated customer returns  price protection  rebates  and other offerings that occur under sales programs established with the company s oems  distributors and resellers 
service revenues  which to date have not been material  include training  consulting and customer support 
revenue from training and consulting are recognized when the service has been performed and the customer has accepted the work 
we recognize revenue from support or maintenance contracts  including post contract customer support pcs services  ratably over the contractual period 
we recognize revenue from software products in accordance with the sop software revenue is allocated to the software license and pcs service elements using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  and recognized appropriately as discussed above 
vsoe of the fair value for an element is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in transactions that include multiple products  services and or software  we allocate the revenue to each element based on their relative fair values or in the absence of fair value  the residual method and recognize the revenue when the above recognition criteria have been met for each element 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable values 
we regularly review inventory on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about current and future demand for our products  the current market conditions  new product introductions  new technologies and the current life cycle of our products 
adverse changes in these factors and our assumptions could result in an increase in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand and increase our cost of revenue 
additionally  we have certain purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers that are non cancelable 
we may be liable for materials that our third party manufacturers purchase on our behalf if our actual requirements do not meet or exceed our forecasts and those materials cannot be redirected to other uses by the contract manufacturers 
we evaluate these open purchase orders in light of our current inventory on hand  expected demand  market conditions and new product introductions 
based on this information  we record purchase obligations for inventory we believe is excess or obsolete and cannot be redirected to other uses by our contract manufacturers 
adverse changes in our and our contract manufacturers calculations and assumptions concerning these purchase commitments may result in an increase to our vendor obligations and increase our cost of revenue 
valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in addition  we also make estimates of potential future product returns 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns  we consider specific accounts  analysis of our accounts receivable aging  changes in customer payment terms  historical write offs and returns  changes in customer demand and relationships  concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
historically  we have experienced a low level of write offs and returns given our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs and product returns and increase our general and administrative expenses or decrease product revenues 
warranty provision we also provide for estimated expenses for warranty obligations as revenue is recognized 
our warranty accruals utilize management s estimates of potential future product warranty claims including the estimated numbers of failures by product and estimated costs to repair or replace failed product 
we have not experienced material warranty claims  however material warranty claims  including the catastrophic or epidemic failure of any one of our products  would require revisions to the estimated warranty liability and could significantly increase our product costs  reduce revenue and cause significant customer relations problems 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction where we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
at january   our net deferred tax assets equaled million before any valuation allowance 
this balance relates to various items in mcdata s results of operations that have different timing or treatment for income tax and financial accounting purposes  such as the timing of revenue recognition and accrued expenses  depreciation methods  and reserve accounts  as well as research and development credits 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we assessed the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have considered past operating losses  cumulative losses for financial accounting in recent years  estimated future taxable income and our ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
after considering all available evidence  both positive and negative  management concluded  after applying the provisions of sfas  that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future 
therefore  a full valuation allowance has been provided against those deferred tax assets 
the portion relating to the acquisitions is applied as an increase to the basis of other assets from the acquired companies 
we are subject to audit by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
these audits may result in additional tax liabilities 
we account for such contingent liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and believe that we have appropriately provided for taxes for all years 
several factors drive the calculation of our tax reserves including i the expiration of statutes of limitations  ii changes in tax law and regulations  and iii settlements with tax authorities 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to our reserves which could impact our reported financial results 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets we review property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
we have performed and will perform an annual impairment test for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
this review is based on a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets including goodwill balances to the fair value of our net assets using the quoted market price of our common stock 
we performed the impairment test during our first fiscal quarter and determined that no impairment loss should be recognized 
in the event that business conditions change  future tests may result in a need to record a loss due to write down of the value of goodwill 
at january   goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
we currently operate our business as a single solutions business and do not maintain separate cash flows or operating margins for any other business segments 
future operating losses  deterioration of our business or segmentation of our operations in the future could also lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
sales commission estimates our sales approach is focused on an indirect model executed primarily through oems and resellers 
our field sales and service personnel support these distribution channels using a direct assist model and are commissioned based on sales results achieved during the reporting period 
because specific sales data used to calculate these commissions is not always available at the time our financial results are released  we routinely make certain estimates based on known revenue achievement  historical experience and assumptions regarding individual sales contributions 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could cause revisions to our sales commission liabilities and result in variations between estimated liabilities and actual payments 
restructuring charges we monitor and regularly evaluate our organization structure and associated operating expenses 
depending on events and circumstances  we may decide to restructure our operations to reduce future operating costs 
in determining the restructuring charges  we analyze our future operating requirements  including the required headcount by functions and facility space requirements 
our restructuring costs  and any resulting accruals  involve significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time the estimates are made  some of which may be provided by third parties 
in recording facilities lease loss reserves  we make various assumptions  including the time period over which the facilities will be vacant  expected sublease terms  expected sublease rates  anticipated future operating expenses  and expected future use of the facilities 
our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control  including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates 
we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and lease loss accruals including the various assumptions noted above 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates and credit risks 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is primarily maintained in four major financial institutions in the united states and consists primarily of readily marketable investment grade debt securities of various issuers and maturities ranging from overnight to greater than ten years 
all investments are denominated in us dollars and are classified as available for sale 
these instruments are not leveraged  and are not held for trading purposes 
as interest rates change  the amount of unrealized gain or loss on these securities will change 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of january   using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant 
the discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at january  the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  assuming that such investment holdings remained constant through the year and an increase of investment income of approximately  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  and a decrease in investment income of approximately our convertible subordinated notes are subject to a fixed interest rate and such notes are based on a fixed conversion ratio into class a common stock 
in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that has the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with the notes so that the interest payable on the majority of the notes effectively becomes variable based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor minus basis points 
if interest rates on this variable rate debt were to increase or decrease by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million 
this increased or decreased interest expense would be partially offset by the effects of these interest rate changes on our cash and investment portfolio 
the notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system  however  the notes are eligible for trading on the portal sm market 
on january   the approximate bid price of our notes was and the approximate ask price of our notes was  resulting in an aggregate fair value of between million and million 
our class a common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market under the symbol  mcdta 
on january   the last reported sale price of our class a common stock on the nasdaq national market was per share 
credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  short and long term investments  including collateral held under the securities lending program as discussed in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements  trade receivables and certain share option transactions 
the company places its temporary cash investments and short and long term investments in investment grade instruments and limits the amount of investment with any one financial institution 
the company evaluates the credit risk associated with each of its customers and has concluded that it does not have a material exposure to credit risk with its customers 
in february  the company sold million of convertible subordinated notes due february  in conjunction with the issuance of these convertible notes  we also entered into share option transactions on our class a common stock with bank of america  na and or certain of its affiliates 
subject to the movement in our class a common stock price  we could be exposed to credit risk arising out of net settlement of these options in our favor 
based on our review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of bank of america  na and its affiliates  we have concluded that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk as a result of these share option transactions
