table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with item business  our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and exhibit risk factors 
overview our auto retail model is focused on acquiring average performing new vehicle franchised stores and then integrating and improving them 
our goal is to maximize the operations of all four departments of every store we acquire 
we have had success with this strategy since our initial public offering in late while our strategy has not changed over the last seven years  our ability to integrate and improve the stores that we acquire has increased dramatically 
we have also developed a better process for identifying acquisition targets that fit our operating model 
our cash position  substantial lines of credit  plus an extremely competent and well trained staff are all available to facilitate our continued growth as the opportunities develop 
in keeping with this model  we acquired stores with franchises during with total estimated annual revenues of approximately million 
during an economic downturn  customers tend to shift towards the purchase of more modestly priced new vehicle models or used vehicles 
many customers decide to delay purchasing a new vehicle and instead repair existing vehicles 
in addition  manufacturers typically offer increased dealer and customer incentives during an economic downturn in order to support new vehicle sales volume 
these factors generally lead to less volatility in earnings for automobile retailers than for automobile manufacturers 
historically  new vehicle sales have accounted for approximately of our total revenues but less than of total gross profit 
in  we continued with a volume based strategy in new vehicle sales that we initiated in through an advertising campaign called driving america that is centered on promo pricing  we were able to gain new vehicle market share in many of our markets 
this strategy complemented the approach taken by the auto manufacturers  which had continued to offer a high level of customer incentives 
in  we expect that manufacturers will continue to incentivize new vehicle sales through a combination of rebates and low interest rate loans to consumers 
we plan to continue with our volume based new vehicle strategy in most of the markets where we operate 
as the economy and the incentive environment change  we will adjust our new vehicle sales strategy accordingly to take advantage of any new conditions 
industry wide used vehicle sales continued to experience substantial weakness throughout all of the competition from highly incentivized new vehicles with low interest rate financing and high rebates had a strong negative impact on the used vehicle market 
the industry also experienced a large number of lease returns that negatively impacted used vehicle pricing throughout the year

same store sales percentage increases decreases were as follows vs

new vehicles retail used vehicles service  body and parts finance and insurance total retail sales same store sales are calculated by dealership comparing only those months that contain full month operating data 
the automotive retailing industry reported declines in new vehicle sales of approximately in compared to and in compared to the industry has reported an approximately decrease in sales of domestic brands in compared to  while we achieved a same store increase in sales of our domestic brands  which represented of our total new vehicle sales in our same store chrysler sales  which represents our largest brand  have increased approximately in the same period 
we have same store sales increases in compared to for all domestic brands  which is counter to national trends 
we are able to generate positive sales trends that run contrary to industry and specific brand trends due to our operating model that is focused on increasing market share through the use of promotional pricing at our stores 
additionally  we believe that the market dynamics of smaller  non metropolitan  western markets support more stable domestic truck and suv sales 
slowing economies in our markets and higher than normal new vehicle inventories at the end of  coupled with a strong new vehicle incentive environment  spurred our aggressive approach to new vehicle sales in during both and  we utilized an aggressive company wide marketing campaign based on the driving america theme that is aimed at increasing market share by competitively pricing new vehicles in order to secure a long term customer base for future parts and service business and repeat and referral business 
the increases in new vehicle sales also led to increases in same store finance and insurance sales  as we have been able to maintain our high penetration rate for such sales 
the industry used vehicle business was weak in and due to competition from highly incentivized new vehicles within the overall weaker total vehicle market 
our used vehicle gross profit demonstrated improvement throughout  achieving retail used vehicle gross margins of   and  respectively  in the first through fourth quarters of the improvements in used vehicle margins in more than offset the declines in same store sales resulting in positive same store gross profit growth for compared to 
table of contents the service and parts business has been negatively impacted in the past couple of years by substantial improvements in the quality of domestic vehicles  resulting in less warranty work  offset in part by increases in the customer pay portion of the business 
however  in the second half of  we saw positive trends with the decline in domestic warranty repairs slowing in comparison to declines in previous quarters and customer pay service and parts growth increasing in  on a same store basis  compared to fleet and other sales include both fleet sales and fees received for delivering vehicles on behalf of the manufacturer  the us military  rent a car companies or leasing companies 
in we decided to deemphasize fleet sales due to their low margins 
this has resulted in a decrease in total fleet and other sales  but an increase in the gross margin percentage due to a higher percentage of fee income compared to fleet income 
penetration rates for certain products were as follows finance and insurance service contracts lifetime oil change and filter during and  manufacturers offered  and are continuing to offer  incentives  including low interest rates and rebates  in order to attract new vehicle buyers 
the availability of cash rebates and zero percent and low interest rate financing have enhanced our ability to sell finance  warranty and insurance products and services in both and gross profit gross profit increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to due primarily to increased total revenues 
gross margins achieved were as follows year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicles bp retail used vehicles service and parts finance and insurance overall year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicles bp retail used vehicles service and parts finance and insurance overall bp stands for basis points one hundred basis points equals one percent 
our overall gross margin increased in compared to due primarily to increases in margins achieved on used vehicle sales as a result of selling older aged vehicles which carry a higher margin and improved inventory management 
these increases in the used vehicle gross margin also contributed to a same store increase in total gross profit dollars per used vehicle sold 

table of contents the improvements in our gross margin in were offset by the following factors a significant shift towards our lowest margin new vehicle business as a result of the strong incentive environment  lower floorplan interest credits from the manufacturers on new vehicles due to lower market rates  and aggressive pricing of new vehicles in order to gain market share  which resulted in lower new vehicle margins 
the decrease in the overall gross margin in compared to was primarily a result of four factors a significant shift towards our lowest margin new vehicle business with the strong incentive environment  lower floorplan interest credits from the manufacturers on new vehicles due to lower market rates  aggressive pricing of new vehicles in order to gain market share  which resulted in lower new vehicle margins  and a mix shift in used vehicle sales to the lower margin  one to three year old vehicles  which have lower margins than the older used vehicles 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in the gross margin achieved in our parts and service business in compared to selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes salaries and related personnel expenses  facility lease expense  advertising net of manufacturer cooperative advertising credits  legal  accounting  professional services and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to due to increased selling  or variable  expenses related to the increase in revenues and the number of locations 
the increase as a percentage of revenue in compared to is due partially to higher advertising and sales compensation expenses related to our aggressive new vehicle marketing 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue in compared to was due to expense leverage on higher sales 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in due to the addition of property and equipment primarily related to our acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in the first quarter of  offset by additions to property and equipment primarily related to acquisitions 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized 
goodwill and other intangibles amortization expense totaled million in income from operations operating margins improved by basis points to in from in the increase is due to the improved overall gross profit margin as discussed above  partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
operating margins decreased basis points in compared to due to the decrease in the overall gross margin percentage  offset in part by lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
floorplan interest expense the million increase in floorplan interest expense in compared to is primarily due to an approximately million increase in expense as a result of an increase in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities  mainly due to acquisitions 
in addition  increased 
table of contents expense from interest rate swaps was responsible for million of the increase 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in the libor and the prime rates in compared to the decrease in floorplan interest expense in compared to was primarily due to approximately million in savings as a result of decreases in the effective interest rate on the floating rate credit lines  offset in part by a million increase in expense as a result of an overall average increase in the outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities  mainly due to acquisitions 
in addition to the interest expense on our flooring lines of credit  floorplan interest expense includes the interest expense related to our interest rate swaps 
other interest expense other interest expense includes interest on debt incurred related to acquisitions  real estate mortgages  our used vehicle line of credit and equipment related notes 
changes in the weighted average interest rate on our debt in compared to decreased other interest expense by  changes in the average outstanding balances in compared to resulted in increases to other interest expense of  the million decrease in other interest expense in compared to resulted from million of savings due to lower interest rates in compared to and approximately million in savings due to the pay down of million on our lines of credit in march  following our equity offering 
these decreases were offset in part by less capitalized interest on construction projects in progress in compared to and by an increase in the outstanding balances due to acquisitions and the financing of previously unfinanced real estate during the lower interest rates in are due in part to the refinancing of million of fixed interest rate mortgage loans since november  utilizing floating rate loans with toyota motor credit and ford motor credit 
income tax expense our effective tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective tax rate may be affected in the future by the mix of asset acquisitions compared to corporate acquisitions  as well as by the mix of states where our stores are located 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue remained flat in compared to as a result of improvements in gross margins being offset by increased operating expenses 
net income net income as a percentage of revenue increased basis points in compared to as a result of increased revenues and lower operating expenses and interest expense  offset by a lower gross margin percentage 
discontinued operations during  we decided to sell certain of our stores and related franchises 
we recognized a net gain on the sale of one of our stores classified as discontinued operations totaling  net of tax  in  which is netted with loss from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of operations 
at december   we had million of assets classified as assets held for sale on our balance sheet related to one store we intend to sell during the assets primarily include inventory and property  plant and equipment 
we did not recognize any gain or loss on disposal of discontinued operations during or we continually monitor the performance of each of our stores and make determinations to sell based on return on capital criteria 

table of contents selected consolidated quarterly financial data the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for the quarterly periods presented

table of contents seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance may be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the other quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt and consumer confidence  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
historically  the timing  performance and frequency of acquisitions have been the largest contributor to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources our principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  as well as for working capital 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and the proceeds from public equity offerings to finance operations and expansion 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital requirements for at least twelve months from december  our free cash flow in  defined as net income plus depreciation minus dividends and maintenance unfinanceable capital expenditures was approximately million 
in and  free cash flow was million and million  respectively 
the reconciliation of net income to free cash flow is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income depreciation dividends maintenance capital expenditures free cash flow our inventories decreased slightly to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to efficiencies gained from the implementation of our new centralized inventory control process  offset by acquisitions 
our new and used flooring notes payable increased to million at december  from million at december  due to a higher percentage of used vehicles being financed as well as an increase in new vehicle inventory and a decrease in used vehicle inventory 
new vehicles are financed at approximately and used vehicles are financed at approximately 
our days supply of new vehicles decreased by approximately days at december  compared to december  our days supply of used vehicles also decreased by approximately days at december  compared to december  our used vehicle inventories are at lowest levels for this time of year compared to the last five years 
we believe that our new and used vehicle inventories are at appropriate levels at this time 
assets of discontinued operations held for sale include inventory and property  plant and equipment related to one store held for sale and are recorded on our balance sheet at the lower of book value or estimated fair market value  less applicable selling costs 
primarily as a result of the acquisition of eleven stores in  our goodwill and other intangibles increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  in  our board of directors approved dividends on our class a and class b common stock of per share for both the second and third quarters of the dividends totaled million 
in february  our board of directors approved a dividend on our class a and class b common stock 
table of contents of per share for the fourth quarter of  which will total approximately million 
we anticipate recommending to the board of directors the approval of a cash dividend each quarter 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
through october  we have purchased a total of  shares under this program and may continue to do so from time to time in the future as conditions warrant 
however  the recent change in the tax law tends to equalize the benefits of dividends and share repurchases as a means to return capital or earnings to shareholders 
as a result  we believe it is now advantageous to shareholders to have a dividend in place 
with the dividend  we are able to offer an immediate and tangible return to our shareholders without reducing our already limited market float  which occurs when we repurchase shares 
in february we entered into a working capital and used vehicle flooring credit facility with daimlerchrysler services north america llc totaling up to million  which expires in february  with interest due monthly 
in december  toyota motor credit joined daimlerchrysler in syndication on this credit facility 
none of the terms of the credit facility were changed 
the credit line with daimlerchrysler services is cross collateralized and secured by cash and cash equivalents  new and used vehicles that are not specifically financed by other lenders  parts inventories  accounts receivable  intangible assets and equipment 
we pledged to daimlerchrysler services the stock of all of our subsidiaries except entities operating bmw  honda  nissan or toyota stores 
the financial covenants in our agreement with daimlerchrysler services require us to maintain compliance with  among other things  i a specified current ratio  ii a specified fixed charge coverage ratio  iii a specified interest coverage ratio  iv a specified adjusted leverage ratio  and v certain working capital levels 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of this agreement 
toyota motor credit corporation  ford motor credit and general motors acceptance corporation have agreed to floor all of our new vehicles for their respective brands with daimlerchrysler services and toyota motor credit corporation serving as the primary lenders for substantially all other brands 
these new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the relevant brands 
we also have a real estate line of revolving credit with toyota motor credit totaling million  which expires in may this line of credit is secured by the real estate financed under this line of credit 
in february  our us bank us credit facility agreement was amended to provide for a million revolving line of credit for leased vehicles and equipment purchases  which expires january  previously  the amount available under this line of credit was million and it was set to expire january  interest rates on all of the above facilities ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december  together with amounts remaining available under such lines were as follows in thousands outstanding at remaining availability as december  of december  new and program vehicle lines working capital and used vehicle line real estate line equipment leased vehicle line there are no formal limits on the new and program vehicle lines with certain lenders 
as limited by the terms of the line regarding the borrowing base 

table of contents contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual and and and obligation total beyond floorplan notes lines of credit and long term debt capital commitments operating leases our capital commitments of million at december  were for the construction of one new store facility and additions to three existing facilities and the remodel of four facilities 
the new facility will be a hyundai store in anchorage  alaska 
we have already incurred million for these projects 
we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances until completion of the projects  at which time we anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended 
in addition  we have recorded a reserve for our estimated contractual obligations related to potential charge backs for vehicle service contracts and lifetime oil change contracts that are terminated early by the customer 
at december   this reserve totaled million 
based on past experience  we estimate that the million will be paid out as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management 
while we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include service contract and lifetime oil contract income recognition  finance fee income recognition  workers compensation insurance premium accrual  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  and used vehicle inventory valuations 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for valuation of accounts receivable  expense accruals and other revenue recognition 
however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable 
however  actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents service contract and lifetime oil change contract income recognition we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts and lifetime oil contracts to customers 
the contracts are sold through an unrelated third party  but we may be charged back for a portion of the fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
at december  and  this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we may also participate in future underwriting profit  pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  that would be recognized as income upon receipt 
finance fee income recognition we receive finance fees from various financial institutions when we arrange financing for our customers on a non recourse basis 
we may be charged back for a portion of the financing fee income when the customer pays off their loan prior to the guidelines agreed to by the various financial institutions 
we have established a reserve for potential net charge backs and cancellations based on historical experience  which typically result if the customer pays off their loan during the to days after receiving financing 
at december  and  this reserve totaled  and  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
workers compensation insurance premium accrual insurance premiums are paid for under a retrospective cost policy  whereby premium cost depends on experience 
we accrue premiums based on our historical experience rating  although the actual experience can be something greater or less than the anticipated claims experience 
we expect that the retrospective cost policy  as opposed to a guaranteed cost with a flat premium  will be the most cost efficient over time 
intangible assets we review our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value based test using discounted estimated cash flows 
discounted future cash flows are prepared by applying a growth rate to historical revenues 
growth rates are calculated individually for each region with data derived from the us census bureau on population growth and the us department of labor  bureau of labor statistics for historical consumer price index data 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is derived from a capital asset pricing model which factors in an equity risk premium and a risk free rate 
the review is conducted more frequently than annually if events or circumstances occur that warrant a review 
our other identifiable intangible assets primarily include the franchise value of the business units  which is considered to have an indefinite life and not subject to amortization  but rather is included in the fair value based testing 
impairment could occur if the operating business unit does not meet the determined fair value testing 
at such point  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value 
during and  we concluded that there was no impairment 
at december  and  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
used vehicle inventory used vehicle inventories are stated at cost plus the cost of any equipment added  reconditioning and transportation 
we select a sampling of dealerships throughout the year to perform quarterly testing of book values against market valuations utilizing the kelly blue book and nada guidelines 
used vehicle inventory values are cyclical and could experience impairment when market valuations are significantly below inventory costs 
historically  we have not experienced significant write downs on our used vehicle inventory 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory and certain real estate holdings 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are tied to either the one or three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates to to  respectively  would increase annual interest expense by approximately  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding on the lines of credit at december  fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall because we could refinance for a lower rate 
conversely  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
at december   we had million of long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding with maturity dates of between january and may based on discounted cash flows  we have determined that the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we have effectively changed the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of our flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not speculate using derivative instruments 
as of december   we have outstanding the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective september  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective february  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month 
table of contents effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month we earn interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
these amounts are recorded as deferred gains or losses in our consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount of deferred gains and losses at december  were and million respectively 
the difference between interest earned and the interest obligation results in a monthly settlement which is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the statement of operations as incremental flooring interest expense 
the resulting cash settlement reduces the amount of deferred gains and losses 
because the critical terms of the interest rate swaps and the underlying debt obligations are the same  there was no ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense 
if  in the future  the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination date  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  we would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the deferred gains or losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
incremental flooring interest expense recognized  net of tax  related to the reclassification of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income was million  million and  respectively  in  and interest expense savings  net of tax  on un hedged debt as a result of decreasing interest rates  based on interest rates effective as of january  was approximately million  million and million  respectively  in  and interest expense savings  net of tax  on un hedged debt as a result of decreasing interest rates  based on interest rates effective as of january of each year was   and million  respectively  in  and as of december   approximately of our total debt outstanding was subject to un hedged variable rates of interest 
at current interest rates  we estimate that we will incur additional interest expense  net of tax  of approximately million related to our interest rate swaps during risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and our forecasted debt obligations as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows
