under the new agreement  sales into certain territories have been transferred to the joint venture partner in exchange for which tdn receives a product development fee equal to the gross margin formerly earned on such sales 
the effect of this change was to reduce sales by million for the fiscal year ended june   with no effect on net earnings 
product development fees included in net sales in fiscal year approximated million 
in fiscal  the company recognized million of sales that are no longer recognized in accordance with the new agreement 
as a result of the strong euro and asian currencies versus the dollar  foreign currency exchange had a net favorable impact on sales of million in fiscal  compared to fiscal in fiscal  sales for our worldwide manufacturing operations  before eliminating intra segment and inter segment sales  were million  or  higher than in the prior year 
over half of this increase came at our domestic manufacturing operations  which saw a recovery across most of its product markets 
of the remaining increase  approximately million was due to the impact of net favorable exchange rate movements on our european operations in belgium and italy 
net sales for distribution operations were down million  or  in fiscal however  there was a million decrease due to the change in the tdn agreement mentioned above 
adjusting for this change  sales were million  or  higher than fiscal of this increase  the net positive impact due to the change in foreign exchange rates was million  or 
from a product perspective  the company saw increases of   and in its industrial  transmission and propulsion product sales 
after adjusting for the impact of the change in the tdn agreement  marine product sales were higher down before adjusting 
of particular note in fiscal was the continued acceptance of our quickshift tm marine transmissions  the overall recovery of the marine pleasure craft market  the double digit sales growth in our arneson surface drives propulsion and series transmission for oilfield applications 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales improved basis points in fiscal to  compared to in fiscal the improvement in fiscal can be attributed to a number of factors increased sales and favorable product mix  which accounted for over half of the current year s improvement  increased productivity and absorption  lower fixed costs as a result of cost reduction initiatives  favorable purchase price variances as a result of a material cost reduction program and the absence in fiscal of a million sfas impairment charge taken in fiscal these were partially offset by a million increase in pension expense in fiscal compared to fiscal marketing  engineering and administrative me a expenses marketing  engineering  and administrative me a expenses increased million  or  in fiscal versus fiscal over million  or basis points  of this increase can be attributed to the unfavorable exchange rate impact of the weakening dollar on our overseas operations me a expenses 
increased pension expense for salaried and administrative employees accounted for another million of the increase 
restructuring during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million in connection with the reduction of its workforce 
these actions were taken in an effort to streamline the company s cost structure and align its corporate workforce with market conditions 
the charge consisted of employee termination and severance benefits for a total of employees  production employees and salaried employees 
during and  the company made cash payments of million and million  respectively 
accrued restructuring costs were million and million at june  and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  or  in fiscal the average outstanding debt for fiscal of million computed monthly was million lower than fiscal the decrease in interest expense for the fifth straight year can be attributed to overall lower debt levels and a lower weighted interest rate 
the latter is partially due to the fact that the company continues to pay down its senior notes  which carry a fixed rate of  which is significantly higher than the interest rate on its other credit facilities 
equity in net earnings of affiliate in january  the company sold its minority interest in palmer johnson distributors  llc

the company recognized pre tax earnings of  and  in fiscal years and respectively  from its investment in pjd 
in addition  the company received cash distributions of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
income taxes in fiscal  the effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by the inability to utilize foreign tax credits and a relatively high proportion of foreign earnings 
the low effective tax rate in fiscal results from the benefit of domestic losses partially offset by taxes incurred on foreign earnings  the inability to utilize foreign tax credits and a reduction in statutory rates at some foreign locations 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets except for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance has been recorded 
order rates in fiscal  we saw an improvement in our order rates for most of our products 
as of fiscal year end  our manufacturing facilities in the united states  belgium and italy saw year over over increases in their six month backlogs of  and  respectively 
the backlog of orders scheduled for shipment during the next six months six month backlog of million at the end of fiscal compared favorably to the million for fiscal year end in june  the company announced that it had received an order to provide transmission systems for medium tactical vehicles to be supplied to israeli defense forces 
as of june   million of the six month backlog related to this military contract 
prior to the over improvement experienced this fiscal year  order rates for most of our products were down throughout much of the prior three fiscal years  contributing along with improved deliveries  to a steady decline in backlog 
the year over year change in foreign exchange rates resulted in an approximately million increase in the backlog at june  versus june  other on july   the company announced a number of actions to address rising pension and retiree healthcare costs  meant to ensure both the future strength of our pension fund and the company s ability to remain globally competitive 
in addition to changes to both the pension and post retirement healthcare plans see footnote p to the consolidated financial statements  the company announced across the board wage reductions for corporate officers  and most domestic salaried and hourly employees 
domestic employee groups  including officers  also will forego performance bonuses in both fiscal and the k company match also has been reduced from percent to percent on the first six percent of employees contributions 
the combined effect of these actions approximately offset projected increases for both pension and post retirement healthcare costs in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  the company will restore salary and wages to their prior levels and plans to implement a new incentive plan that emphasizes the achievement of earning returns in excess of the company s cost of capital as well as other financial and non financial objectives 
it is estimated that the annual net pre tax impact of the salary and wage restoration will be approximately million 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased less than one percent to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a result of the strong euro and asian currencies versus the dollar  foreign currency exchange had a net favorable impact on sales of million in fiscal  compared to fiscal in fiscal  our domestic operations experienced a decline in sales versus in all market segments except for propulsion  which had a very strong year 
after adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange rate changes  sales for overseas operations were slightly higher in fiscal compared to overall  the company s three major markets  marine  transmission and industrial products  all continued to be impacted by global economic conditions 
however  the second half of the fiscal saw significant contributions from new product introductions  such as our high performance quickshift tm marine transmissions and the series transmissions for oilfield applications  which supplemented improving core business strength 
our continuing ability to compete successfully for defense applications was underscored by the million contract for transmission systems announced in june  augmenting recently awarded us defense contracts for other land based transmissions 
sales from this contract were first realized in late fiscal for fiscal  the company s wholly owned distribution companies posted a improvement in sales  of which can be attributed to the favorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations versus fiscal in particular  we saw strong sales for arneson surface drives and the italian luxury yacht industry weathered the pleasure craft downturn better than any other segment 
our distribution offices in italy and the pacific rim continued to show strength in spite of weak global market conditions 
we had mixed results in our manufacturing operations in fiscal our italian operations posted another strong sales year with an increase of versus fiscal however  the majority of this increase was caused by the strengthening euro 
although our belgian operations got off to a slow start in fiscal  the second half of the year saw some recovery as we began to produce and see the effects of our new quickshift marine transmissions 
after adjusting for the impact of a strengthening euro in fiscal  our belgian operations posted a slight increase in sales  primarily driven by a very strong fourth quarter 
in the us  our domestic operations were faced with a number of challenges early in fiscal in the first quarter  quality problems necessitated downtime in order to segregate non conforming parts received from two of the company s vendors 
by the end of the second quarter  the disruption of production flow as a result of these vendor supplied off spec parts was normalized 
in the second quarter  the company announced restructuring actions that impacted both our us and belgian manufacturing operations see footnote s to the consolidated financial statements 
these actions were taken in an effort to streamline the company s cost structure and align its corporate workforce with market conditions 
in addition to these challenges  the company continued to be confronted with softness in many of its key markets 
however  propulsion products continued to be a strong area for the company in fiscal  increasing over versus the prior year almost half of this increase is attributable to exchange rate changes versus fiscal gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales deteriorated basis points to in fiscal compared to fiscal almost half of the deterioration can be attributed to increased pension and medical costs of nearly million  and a million impairment charge taken in the second quarter see footnote f to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining deterioration was due to unfavorable volume and mix in fiscal as well as supplier quality issues the company experienced in the first and second quarters of fiscal the latter was somewhat offset by ongoing productivity and cost improvement initiatives in our manufacturing operations 
despite early setbacks caused by the supplier quality issues and restructuring actions taken in the first half of  the second half of the year was much stronger 
for example  fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of sales of compared favorably with fiscal at 
marketing  engineering and administrative me a expenses in fiscal  marketing  engineering  and administrative me a expenses remained flat versus the prior year  in spite of an almost million increase attributable to the unfavorable exchange rate impact of the weakening dollar on our overseas operations 
this was achievable primarily as a result of ongoing cost reduction initiatives  including the restructuring actions announced in the nd quarter 
for fiscal  total engineering related expenses were approximately million higher than the prior year as the company continued to invest in engineering projects related to the development of new marine  industrial  surface drive and electronic control products 
this increase was more than offset by reductions in marketing and administrative expenses  even with the negative foreign exchange impact 
approximately one half of the million increase in fiscal spending was due to the first year expenses of ntc  and the balance consisted of added marketing and engineering expenses related to a new product introduction 
restructuring during the second quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million in connection with the reduction of its workforce 
these actions were taken in an effort to streamline the company s cost structure and align its corporate workforce with market conditions 
the charge consisted of employee termination and severance benefits for a total of employees  production employees and salaried employees 
during  the company made cash payments of million 
accrued restructuring costs were million at june  interest expense interest expense declined for the fourth straight year in fiscal as debt was further reduced by million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  and the company continued to pay down its senior notes  which carry a significantly higher interest rate than its revolver facility 
income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal was adversely effected by state income taxes and higher taxes at foreign operations 
the low effective tax rate in fiscal results from the benefit of domestic losses partially offset by taxes incurred on foreign earnings  the inability to utilize foreign tax credits and a reduction in statutory rates at some foreign locations 
in fiscal year  limitations on foreign tax credit utilization  the relatively high proportion of foreign earnings and settlement of some state tax issues resulted in an unusually high tax rate 
the effective rate in fiscal was increased further by two third quarter adjustments totaling about  also in fiscal  a tax incentive provided by the belgian government several years ago was disallowed by the european commission and was refunded to the government  and the united states tax provision was adjusted upward for the taxes due on an asset sale gain recorded in the prior year s third quarter 
statutory rate changes at european operations reduced taxes in by approximately  management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets except for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards for which a valuation allowance has been recorded 
order rates order rates for most of our products were down throughout much of fiscal and  contributing along with improved deliveries  to a steady decline in backlog 
the backlog of orders scheduled for shipment during the next six months six month backlog remained relatively flat at million at the end of fiscal however  the year over year change in foreign exchange rates resulted in an approximately million increase in the backlog at june  versus june  the year over year change in foreign exchange rates resulted in an approximately million increase in the backlog at june  versus june  liquidity and capital resources fiscal years  and cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal cash flows from operating activities were million higher than the prior year 
fiscal experienced significantly higher net earnings than in fiscal  a profit of million versus a loss of million in the prior fiscal year  for a net increase of million 
in addition  improved cash flows in fiscal related to a decrease in accounts receivable and other assets versus increases in the prior year for a net change of million and million  respectively as well as a net change in provision for deferred income taxes of million 
these net favorable year over year operating cash flows were offset partially by the net year over year unfavorable cash flow impacts of increased inventories of million and decreased accrued prepaid retirement benefits of million 
the fiscal cash flows from operating activities were million lower than fiscal fiscal experienced a net loss of million versus net earnings of million in fiscal  for a net decrease in operating cash flows of million 
in addition  a further reduction in operating cash flows in fiscal related to an increase in accounts receivable and other assets versus the prior year of million and million  respectively  as well as a net decrease in the operating cash flow impact of the year over year change in the provision for deferred income taxes of million 
these net unfavorable year over year operating cash flows were offset partially by the net year over year favorable cash flow impacts of a smaller decrease in accrued liabilities in fiscal versus of million and increased accrued prepaid retirement benefits of million 
the net cash used for investing activities in fiscal consisted of the net acquisition price for rolla sp propellers sa of million  net of million cash acquired  and nearly million in investments in capital equipment offset by the net proceeds from the sale of the company s minority interest in pjd  inc to the majority holder for million 
in fiscal and  the net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures at our domestic and european manufacturing locations 
in fiscal  the company continued its effort to invest in key manufacturing cells in both our domestic and european operations 
total capital spending totaled million in fiscal  slightly below the level of the prior year and just over million higher than in fiscal a little over of the capital investment made in fiscal was at our domestic manufacturing locations 
with the acquisition of rolla sp propellers sa of balerna  switzerland in may  the company is in the process of constructing a new state of the art facility for the design and manufacturing of high performance  custom propellers 
as a result  management expects capital expenditures in fiscal to significantly exceed recent years  reversing a trend of below depreciation capital spending 
in fiscal  and  the net cash flow used by financing activities consisted primarily of dividends paid to shareholders of million and the repayment of long term debt 
in each fiscal year  the company repaid million of its senior notes due the net payments proceeds from long term debt were payments or borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility 
future liquidity and capital resources twin disc has a three year million revolving credit facility that expires in october this credit facility is used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and other financing needs 
this facility and twin disc s other indebtedness contain certain restrictive covenants as are fully disclosed in note j of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
twin disc is currently renegotiating its revolving credit agreement and plans to have a new agreement negotiated by the end of fiscal s first quarter 
at this time  we do not foresee any difficulties in securing an extension as well as an increase in the available borrowings under the agreement 
the overall liquidity of the company remains strong 
we continue to reduce total borrowings  have over million of available borrowings on our million revolving loan agreement  and continue to generate enough cash from operations to meet our operating and investing needs 
in fiscal  the company expects to contribute million to its pension plans  an increase of nearly million over fiscal the company intends to meet this funding requirement from cash from operations and  if necessary  from available borrowings under existing credit facilities 
working capital increased million to about million in fiscal  and the current ratio has been unchanged at between and for the past four fiscal years 
the company s balance sheet is strong  there are no off balance sheet arrangements  and we continue to have sufficient liquidity for near term needs 
twin disc expects capital expenditures to be up to million in fiscal  partially reflecting the impact of the cost of a new a facility under construction in switzerland noted above 
these anticipated expenditures reflect our plans to continue to reinvest in modern equipment and facilities  and new products 
management believes that available cash  the credit facility  cash generated from future operations  existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund twin disc s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company had no off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees or obligations except for normal open purchase orders and operating leases as of june  and obligations for operating leases are listed in the table below 
the company has obligations under non cancelable operating lease contracts and loan and senior note agreements for certain future payments 
a summary of those commitments follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years short term debt   revolving loan borrowing   long term debt    operation leases      the company believes the capital resources available in the form of existing cash  lines of credit see footnote j to the consolidated financial statements  and funds provided by operations will be adequate to meet anticipated capital expenditures and other foreseeable future business requirements  including pension funding requirements 
as noted above  the company is currently in discussions to increase the borrowings available under and extend its  revolving loan agreement  which expires on october  management expects to have the amended agreement finalized before the end of fiscal s first quarter 
other matters environmental matters the company has been involved in various stages of investigation relative to hazardous waste sites  two of which were on the united states epa national priorities list superfund sites 
the company s involvement in one of the superfund sites was settled in for approximately  the company has made a  payment in trust in settlement of its exposure related to the second superfund site and anticipates that no further payments will be required 
the excess reserve for these sites of  was reversed against cost of sales in critical accounting policies the preparation of this annual report requires management s judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
twin disc s significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements on pages through of this form 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition twin disc recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
while we respect the customer s right to return products that were shipped in error or do not function properly  historical experience shows those types of adjustments have been immaterial and thus no provision is made 
with respect to other revenue recognition issues  management has concluded that its policies are appropriate and in accordance with the guidance provided by securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accounts receivable twin disc performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s credit worthiness as determined by review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
in addition  senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible 
although our accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the inventories located in the united states  and by the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on future orders  demand forecasts  and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the adjustments to the reserve are estimates that could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
warranty twin disc engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers 
however  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation 
the warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical claim rates and costs of repair  knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends 
while we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate must be estimated 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure and assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
if it is deemed more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded
