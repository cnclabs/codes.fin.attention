item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled business factors that may affect future results for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we develop  manufacture and market products for medical applications using embolotherapy techniques 
our core technologies  consisting of patented bio engineered polymers and manufacturing methods  are used to produce miniature spherical beads with unique properties for a variety of applications 
embolotherapy works by reducing blood flow to targeted areas of the body 
the procedure is performed by injecting particles through a catheter into the blood vessels that feed these target areas 
by selectively blocking the target tissue s blood supply  the deprived tissue will either become destroyed or devitalized  resulting in therapeutic benefit 
we generate revenues primarily from product sales of our embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres in north america 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenues from product sales in europe and other geographic territories including the middle east  africa  south america  and the far east 
product revenues also include the sale of accessory embolotherapy devices such as our embocath catheter and our segway guidewire  as well as our other non embolotherapy products  including barium and other ancillary medical devices 
we derived a majority of our revenues in the united states for the years ended december  and from the sale of embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres for use in uterine fibroid embolization  or ufe 
in april  we received clearance from the fda for the use of embosphere microspheres in the embolization of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations 
in november  we received additional clearance from the fda to market our embosphere microspheres for use in treating symptomatic uterine fibroids 
we do not have fda clearance to market our embogold microspheres for use in the treatment of uterine fibroids  and determined in not to seek such approval at this time 
we made this decision because of reports that a small number of the patients treated with ufe using embogold microspheres  which we believe constitute approximately of the total number of patients receiving the procedure  reported a delayed onset of pain and or rash 
if we cease to market embogold microspheres for any reason  we could incur substantial costs to write off and replace existing inventory 
we received ce mark approval of our embosphere microspheres product in the european union in ce mark approval is a certification granted by european regulatory bodies  or by some manufacturers with satisfactory quality systems  that substantiates the compliance of products with specific standards of quality and or safety 
this approval is generally required prior to the commercialization of a medical device in the european union 
in january  we received marketing approval of our embosphere microspheres product in australia and canada 
our principal focus is on growing our embosphere microsphere business worldwide  which we believe will be a key driver to our success 
we have not yet received widespread market acceptance of the ufe procedure 
our success will depend upon the acceptance by the medical community  patients and third party payers of the ufe procedure as medically therapeutic and cost effective 
in late  after receiving ufe marketing clearance for our embosphere microspheres  we began an aggressive marketing strategy to promote ufe through our askufe awareness and education program and also to specifically promote our embosphere microspheres as the choice of treatment for ufe 
we have experienced operating losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
most of our expenditures to date have been for sales and marketing activities  general and administrative expenses and research and development activities 
we expect to experience continued operating losses until at least the fourth quarter of as we execute our business plan  including continuing to establish sales and marketing capabilities and conducting research and development activities 
research and development the following table identifies each of our major product and research and development programs and the current development phase of each product 
product product candidate development status embosphere microspheres marketed in united states  canada  australia and eu embogold microspheres marketed in united states  canada  australia and eu embocath infusion catheter marketed in the united states  canada and eu segway guidewire marketed in the united states  canada and eu hepasphere sap microspheres clinical evaluation in japan  seeking ce mark approval in the eu temprx microspheres early stage pre clinical research radiosphere microspheres early stage pre clinical research research and development expenses relate primarily to research to identify and evaluate new and innovative embolotherapy products based on our platform microsphere technology  pre clinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates  development related to improving manufacturing processes  and product and production facilities validation processes under fda good manufacturing practices 
total research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing approximately  and of our total costs and expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our research and development functions typically work on a number of projects concurrently 
in addition  except for clinical expenses  a substantial amount of fixed research and development costs such as salary and salary related benefits  rent  equipment depreciation  utilities  insurance and maintenance are shared among various programs 
accordingly  we have not historically tracked specific costs for each of our research and development projects 
there is a risk that any medical device development program may not produce revenue 
moreover  because of uncertainties inherent in medical device development  including those factors described above under business risk factors that may affect results  we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize any of the product candidates included in the table above 
as described in the table above  we are seeking ce mark approval for our hepasphere sap microspheres  which are also in clinical evaluation in japan 
our temprx microspheres and radiosphere microspheres product development initiatives are in pre clinical and clinical evaluation 
the successful development of these early stage product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medical devices  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us  future clinical trials results  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth above in business risk factors that may affect results 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are most critical in gaining an understanding of our financial statements include policies and judgments relating to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories and deferred taxes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note b to our consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical in gaining full understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines summarized in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as updated by sab no 
revenue recognition  corrected copy 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists a valid purchase order from an approved customer  and the sales price is fixed 
we establish reserves for potential sales returns and evaluate  on a monthly basis  the adequacy of those reserves based upon realized experience 
under our current policy  only those products on a customer s initial order qualify for product satisfaction related credit returns 
to date  returns related to product satisfaction have been minimal and immaterial 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant change in product satisfaction and any resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical payment experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
substantially all of our receivables are due from hospitals  distributors  health care clinics  and managed care systems located throughout the united states  australia  canada  and europe 
a significant portion of products sold  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on liquidity and profitability of our customer base 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the market value for such inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities in process and on hand and record a provision for production loss and obsolete inventory based primarily on actual loss experience and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our costs of product sales at the time of such determination 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our production process and forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in production yield or product demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
deferred taxes we use the asset and liability accounting method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current statutory tax rates 
a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  the ability to recover the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance 
due to the size of our net operating loss carry forward in relation to our history of unprofitable operations  we have not recognized any of our net deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded income tax benefits equal to the cumulative amount of recoverable prior years tax payments and expense primarily foreign subsidiary and certain state minimum net worth tax for current income 
however  future improvements in operational performance could result in the increased certainty of our ability to apply our deferred tax assets against taxable income  which could  in turn  result in a significant impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and our reported operating results 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the same period in of the  or  increase in product sales in   was due to the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 
the remaining  increase was due to worldwide sales growth of our embocath catheter and our segway guidewire  which were launched in the fourth quarter of the majority of our revenues in was derived from the sale of embosphere microspheres 
as a result of our strategic focus on ufe and other embolotherapy applications using our microsphere products  we expect that sales of embosphere microspheres and our ancillary embolotherapy delivery systems will continue to increase and will account for substantially all of our revenues in costs of product sales 
costs of product sales for the year ended december  were million  compared with million for the same period in the  or million  increase was primarily due to the following factors our manufacturing overhead increased  in from the establishment of a us manufacturing team that we expect will assist in improving the overall quality and efficiency of the manufacturing process and increase the capacity of our french manufacturing facility  the european launch of embosphere microspheres in sterile syringe packages that are manufactured through a sub contractor agreement resulted in higher total unit cost  which contributed  to the increase  we experienced a foreign currency impact of  due to a stronger euro against the us dollar  we reserved an additional  in as compared to for obsolescence of specific sizes of embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres that were historically slow moving  we launched our segway guidewire and embocath catheter in the fourth quarter of  and we experienced  in additional cost of product sales in in connection with a full year of sales volume  and we incurred a one time expense of  to streamline the delivery system supply chain  which is expected to result in future manufacturing cost savings 
gross margin decreased from million or in to million or in  primarily due to the addition of fixed costs of product sales as described above  net of foreign currency translation adjustments 
we expect that future gross margin will be highly correlated with the following factors revenue growth  production levels  foreign exchange rate movements  and sub contracted manufacturer and supplier agreement terms and conditions 
research and development expense 
total research and development expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the  or million  decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the completion of our pivotal phase ii clinical trials in to support fda specific labeling clearance to use our microsphere products in the treatment of uterine fibroids 
total clinical costs were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also contributing to the decrease in total research and development expenses in was a reduction in certain non essential headcount after the completion of development related projects in we estimate that during the years ended december  and  the majority of our research and development expenses were related to clinical trial costs  development and validation of our new embolotherapy products and packaging formats  development and validation of our embocath catheter and segway guidewire  as well as salary and related benefit expenses and laboratory supplies related to our radiosphere  temprx and hepasphere sap programs 
sales expense 
sales expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million in sales expense in included  of stock based compensation to non employees 
the  or  increase in the year ended december  was primarily due to salary and salary related benefits as a result of an increase in headcount in the us sales force and to a lesser degree the stronger euro against the us dollar 
marketing expense 
marketing expense for the year ended december  increased to million  from million for the same period in marketing expense in includes  of stock based compensation to non employees 
the  or million  increase was primarily due to expenses relating to our ufe awareness and education programs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the  or  decrease was primarily due to the executive transition and severance expenses incurred in in connection with the departure of certain executives of the company  and the reduced executive bonus expense in interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared with  in the decrease in interest income from to was due primarily to decreases in the average daily invested cash balances and interest rates on available investment grade assets 
interest expense 
interest expense is generally incurred in relation to capital leases for the year ended december  and short term working capital bank obligations 
interest expense for the year ended december  was relatively constant at  compared to  for the year ended december  other income 
other income for the year ended december  increased to  from  in the increase in was due primarily to realized euro to us dollar foreign currency exchange gains associated with our intercompany trade accounts 
income tax benefit provision 
the income tax provision represents minimum corporate taxes due in both france and in the united states 
income tax benefit recorded during represents recoverable prior year tax expense 
all other future tax benefits resulting from our operating losses have been reserved for in their entirety  as management believes the ability to realize any benefit against future taxable income is uncertain 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the same period in the  or million  increase in product sales in when compared to is primarily due to an increase in the volume of sales of embogold microspheres and embosphere microspheres in north america 
also significantly contributing to the sales growth in was an increase in the average per unit selling price of our microspheres  driven mostly by the september introduction of a premium priced embogold microsphere in a pre filled syringe package  and the may introduction of our new embosphere microspheres pre filled syringe package 
north american product sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
included in total revenues were  of collaboration revenues earned in relation to a supply agreement that was dissolved in as a result of our strategic focus on ufe and other embolotherapy applications using our microsphere products  we expect that sales of embosphere microspheres and our ancillary embolotherapy delivery systems will continue to increase and account for substantially all of our revenues in cost of product sales 
costs of products sales for the year ended december  were million  compared with million for the same period in the  or  increase was primarily due to a increase in product sales  partially offset by a shift in the aggregate product sales mix away from the lower margin european ancillary device products to the higher margin embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres products 
gross margin from all our device product sales for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of product sales  compared with million  or of product sales  for the same period in research and development expense 
total research and development expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the  or  decrease was primarily due to the completion of our pivotal phase ii clinical trials to support fda specific labeling clearance to use our microsphere products in the treatment of uterine fibroids 
total clinical costs were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also contributing to the decrease was a decline in new syringe and new vial packaging validation costs as we transitioned these products out of development and into production in late offsetting the decrease  to a limited extent  was an increase in salary and related benefit expenses associated with increased research and development functions in the united states 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the period included  of stock based compensation to non employees 
the  or million  reduction in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to territory realignment to focus our efforts on geographic areas with higher anticipated procedural volume 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million in from million for the year ended december  the  or  increase was primarily due to executive transition and severance expenses incurred in connection with the departures of the former ceo and european president 
offsetting the total general and administrative expense increase was the absence of litigation defense expenses during and the elimination of goodwill amortization expenses as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
interest income expense 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared with  in the decrease in interest income in was due primarily to decreases in the average daily invested cash balances and interest rates on available investment grade assets 
interest expense 
interest expense is generally incurred in relation to capital leases and short term working capital bank obligations 
interest expense for the year ended december  was relatively constant at  compared to  for the year ended december  other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  increased to  from  in the increase in was due primarily to realized euro to us dollar foreign currency exchange gains associated with our intercompany trade accounts 
the loss of  was primarily comprised of realized foreign currency exchange losses 
also contributing to the increase in other income in was a  reversal during of a french statutory reserve established in connection with a business acquisition 
income tax benefit 
income tax benefit recorded during represents recoverable prior year tax expense 
all other tax benefit resulting from our operating losses has been reserved for in its entirety as management believes the ability to realize any benefit against future taxable income is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations from the net proceeds provided by public and private equity offerings  funds provided by the sale of our former chromatography business  funds provided by sepracor  net revenues  bank financing  equipment financing leases and  to a lesser extent  the exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of million from million as of december  this decrease resulted from million used to fund operations   used to purchase property and plant  and  in euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate adjustments 
offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of  as of december   we had million in working capital 
we expect to finance our operations through our existing cash balances 
for the year ended december   we used million in operating cash primarily to fund our sales  marketing  research and product development activities and to finance working capital requirements 
cash used in operations is expected to decrease over the remainder of as anticipated increases in product sales are expected to partially offset our operational and product development expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and primarily represents transfers of investments to cash to fund current operational needs 
offsetting the total increase was  in property and equipment purchases 
property and equipment purchases during the year ended december  included the acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment for the packaging and sterilization of our embosphere microspheres syringes and vials at our facility in roissy  france 
we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures over the next twelve months will be approximately  which is comparable with levels of spending over the prior twelve month period 
these capital expenditures are principally related to the purchase of manufacturing  production and office equipment  consistent with our plan to expand our infrastructure capabilities 
if available on favorable terms  we expect to finance certain future fixed asset acquisitions through leasing arrangements 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the twelve months ended december   of which  resulted from the exercise of common stock options  and from the proceeds of common stock sold under the employee stock purchase program 
we also made payments of  towards long term debt and capital lease obligations in the twelve month period ending december  we believe that our existing cash and other working capital  including the approximate million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we have as of december   will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements  as currently planned  at least into the first quarter of however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  changes in our ufe marketing programs  anticipated research and development efforts  the scope and results of pre clinical and clinical testing  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the timing and results of fda regulatory review and the market s acceptance of any approved products  including our embosphere microspheres for ufe 
we may incur additional costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  pre clinical studies  clinical trials  the expansion of our manufacturing  laboratory and administrative functions  as well as costs relating to further market development and commercialization efforts 
we may also need additional funds for such activities and for possible strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses  products and or technologies 
these additional funds may be substantial and raised from time to time through additional public or private sales of equity  through borrowings  or through other financings 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional funding that may be required  or that any such funding will be on acceptable terms 
borrowing arrangements in march  bmsa entered into a   equivalent as of december  term loan with a french national bank that is payable in euros over four years and accrues interest at per annum 
the total loan balance outstanding as of december  was approximately  or in may  we entered into a two year credit facility with a bank under which we may borrow  subject to limitations defined in the agreement  up to million for general working capital and corporate purposes 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement as of december  each available   or day advance shall bear interest at a per annum rate that we may select equal to either i a variable rate as determined by the bank or ii a rate equal to the corresponding   or day libor rate to of december  plus a libor advance rate spread as determined by certain current working capital balances at the time of the advance 
as of december   there was approximately million available to borrow under this credit facility 
our ability to borrow under this credit line is dependent upon maintenance of certain financial ratios and levels of cash and cash equivalents and tangible capital bases 
in connection with the credit facility  we entered into a security agreement pursuant to which we have pledged to the bank all of our us assets  excluding the equity ownership of bmsa  as collateral 
as of december   we were in compliance with all credit facility covenants 
contractual obligations as of december   we are party to two operating leases for the lease of our facilities in rockland  massachusetts and roissy  france 
the rockland  massachusetts  lease expires in march and the roissy  france operating lease expires in may during  we entered into several non cancelable capital lease agreements with various equipment financing companies  in connection with the acquisition of certain manufacturing and computer equipment 
the equipment leases have initial terms of to months with interest rates of to 
equipment leased under these arrangements serves as pledged capital with respect to each capital lease agreement 
future cash payments  including interest  under contractual obligations in effect as of december   are as follows period thereafter total contractual obligations in thousands term loans operating leases capital leases total related party transactions during the year ended  we did not have any related party transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we believe that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidations of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  in december  the fasb issued fin r  which supersedes fin fin r will be applicable to all non spe s created prior to february  by public companies that are not small business issuers at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the company believes that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its financial statements or our results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  corrected copy  which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments 
however  in the future  we may consider certain financing instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  or alternative instruments  which may be considered derivative in nature 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our operations in france 
operations in france are denominated in the euro  and as of december   approximately  or  remained outstanding within the inter company trade accounts 
accordingly  a hypothetical percent increase in euro to us dollar conversion rates would result in an approximate  foreign currency market to market change in the fair value of our inter company trade account balance as of december  we have not engaged in formal currency hedging activities to date  but do have a limited natural hedge in that our revenues and expenses in france are primarily denominated in the euro 
we also attempt to minimize exchange rate risk by converting non us currency to non us dollars as often as practicable 
we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries operating under a functional currency the euro other than our reporting currency the us dollar as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the other accumulated comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
because our foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material  no quantitative tabular disclosure has been provided 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that an increase in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to decrease 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  investment grade asset backed corporate securities  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  due to the conservative nature of our investments  the relatively short duration of their maturities  our ability to convert some or all of our long term investments to less interest rate sensitive holdings and our general intent to hold most securities until maturity  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   approximately of the million classified as available for sale marketable securities will mature within one year
