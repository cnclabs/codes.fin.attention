our future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors that are beyond our control 
these include the factors set forth in forward looking statements 
accordingly  past results and trends may not be reliable indicators of future results or trends 
with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution readers that a number of important factors discussed in this report could affect our actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview we are a financial holding company offering full service community banking and financial services through locations in kansas  missouri  nebraska  oklahoma and colorado through our wholly owned banking subsidiaries  teambank n 
a and colorado national bank 
our presence in kansas consists of seven locations in the kansas city metro area and three locations in southeast kansas 
we operate two locations in western missouri  three in the metropolitan area of omaha  nebraska  and one in colorado springs  colorado 
a second location in colorado springs  colorado will be opened in march additionally  we provide insurance services in the tulsa  oklahoma metropolitan area 
our total assets over the past eight years have more than doubled  growing from million at january  to million december  the growth in assets and the corresponding increase in earnings were achieved primarily through purchases of branches of large banks  the purchase of community banks  and branch expansion 
our branch expansion includes growth at existing branches as well as the opening of new branches 
accompanying the acquisition growth were increased operating expenses resulting from growth as well as increases in provisions for loan losses and amortization expense of intangible assets related to acquisitions and in some instances issuance of shares of common stock in conjunction with the acquisitions 
our experience is that it takes between to months to realize meaningful net income improvements from acquisitions and expansion due to our emphasis on retaining key employees rather than the immediate implementation of cost reduction measures 
at december  total assets were million  a decrease of million  or  from million at december  the decrease in total assets was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million and a decrease in investment securities of million offset by an increase in loans of million  an increase in premises and equipment of million and an increase in other assets of million 
total assets at december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in total assets at december  net income totaled million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in net interest income of million  or  offset by a decrease in tax expense of million  or 
net income totaled million for the year ended december  versus million for december  the increase for compared to was primarily the result of a  increase on sale of loans from the favorable interest rate environment for home re financings and new home purchases  and a  decrease in goodwill expense due to the adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the unites states of america 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statement of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses we establish allowances for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses charged to operations is based on management s judgment of current economic conditions and the credit risk of the loan portfolio 
management believes that this allowance is adequate for the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on borrowers conditions and changes in economic conditions 
impairment of goodwill analysis as required by the provisions of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred 
the evaluation of possible impairment of intangible assets involves judgment based upon short term and long term projections of future performance 
there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  or analysis of the results of operations net interest income our income is derived primarily from net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans  investment securities  federal funds sold  and interest bearing deposits  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and interest rates earned and expensed 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following tables set forth the average balances of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as the amount of interest income or interest expense and the average rate for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate for the periods indicated

total interest income on a tax equivalent basis for was million  representing a decrease of million  or  from million for the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income on loans receivable and a million decrease on taxable investment securities 
interest income on loans receivable decreased due to a basis point decrease in the average yield on the loans receivable to in from in offset with an increase of million in the average loan receivable balance to million in from million in the decrease in the yield of loans receivable reflects the decrease in the rates applied to loans that re priced in as required by the notes terms or were refinanced by customers at lower rates 
interest income from taxable investment securities was million during  a decrease of million  or  from of million 
the decrease was due to a decrease in the average rate of basis points to in from in the decrease in the average rate of investment securities was related to the relatively low interest rates in the market 
the decrease has caused many of our portfolio s issuers of securities to retire or prepay their securities prior to maturity since they have been able to refinance at lower rates 
because of these early prepayments  we have re invested the proceeds in lower yielding securities  which reflect the decline in market interest rates 
in addition  the early prepayments accelerate the amortization on premiums paid for investment securities further decreasing the yield on the securities 
total interest expense was million for  a million  or  decrease from million in the decrease was primarily related to the decrease in average rate paid on savings deposits and interest bearing checking balances to 
in from in  representing a basis point decrease  and to the decrease in average rate paid on time deposits to in from in  representing a basis point decrease 
additionally there was a decrease in the average balance of interest bearing savings and checking deposits of approximately to million in from million in and a decrease of in average time deposit balances to million in from million in the decrease in the average deposits balances was due to the sale of two bank branches in june the average balance of notes payable and federal home loan bank advances increased million as we continued to borrow from the federal home loan bank and invest the proceeds to achieve the planned balance sheet management strategy to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet 
the average rate on notes payable and federal home loan bank advances decreased basis points to during from during as a result of the changes described above  the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased to million during  representing a decrease of million  or  compared to of million 
the average rate paid on our subordinated debentures  which we issued in third quarter in connection with the sale by our wholly owned subsidiary  team financial capital trust i the trust  of trust preferred securities  was for and the difference between the contractual amount of and the reported interest rate is the amortization of debt issuance costs  which are amortized over a year period

total interest income on a tax equivalent basis for was million  representing a decrease of million  or  from million for the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income on loans receivable 
interest income on loans receivable decreased due to a basis point decrease in the yield on the loans receivable to in from in  as well as a million decrease in the average balance of loans receivable to million in from million in the decrease in the yield of our loans receivable was the result of a decrease of basis points in the national prime interest rate from january  also contributing to the decrease in yield was the decrease of our average balance of loans receivable  primarily due to a decrease in our one to four family loan portfolio  as customers re financed loans due to favorable long term fixed mortgage interest rates 
we typically sell fixed rate loans to the secondary market instead of maintaining the loans in our loan portfolio 
interest income from taxable investment securities increased million for the year compared to  primarily due to a million purchase of short term mortgage backed securities from the proceeds of long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
this transaction was initiated in the third quarter of as an interest rate risk management strategy 
the federal home loan bank borrowings  which carried an average rate of  consisted of million in year fixed rate advances convertible to floating rate advances if libor increases to within the next years and million in year fix rate advances convertible to floating rate advances if libor increases to within the next years 
the intent of the transaction was to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to benefit from an increase in interest rates and borrow long term borrowings during the period of historical low interest rates 
the yield on taxable investment securities decreased basis points to in from in  which was related to the decrease in market interest rates since january of total interest expense was million for  a million  or decrease  from million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily related to the decrease in interest rates since january of the average rate paid on savings deposits and interest bearing checking balances decreased basis points to in from in and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in from in the average balance of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased million as a result of our reduction in overnight federal funds purchased due to increased liquidity resulting from the decrease in loans receivable balances 
the average rate paid on federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased basis points to for from for the average balance of notes payable and federal home loan bank advances increased million as we borrowed million in long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank at approximately and invested the proceeds into short term mortgage backed securities 
the average rate on notes payable and federal home loan bank advances decreased basis points to during from during the average balance of our subordinated debentures increased million due to the issuance of million in subordinated debentures in  purchased by our subsidiary  team financial capital trust i 
concurrent with the issuance of the subordinated debentures  the trust issued million in cumulative trust preferred securities 
the proceeds from the sale of the debentures were used to acquire colorado national bank in the third quarter of the average rate on loans receivable decreased basis points due to the decrease in interest rates during the year 
as a result of the changes described above  the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million for  representing an increase of million  or  from million during the following table presents the components of changes in our net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  attributed to volume and rate 
changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior fiscal year s average interest rate 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to change in interest rates are calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the prior fiscal year s average volume 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and change in interest rate are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in volume

provision for loan losses a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical loss experience  the volume and type of lending conducted  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to our market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of our loan portfolio 
after considering the above factors  management recorded a provision for loan losses on loans totaling million for the year ended and million for the years ended and the provision recorded for the year ended was predicated upon the level of non performing loans and net charge offs during the year of million

the increase in total loans receivable was primarily due to our continued allocation of resources to the commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate markets 
our commitment to focus our resources on internal loan growth in these areas produced an increase of million  or in these loans compared to offsetting the increase in our commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate loans was the continued decrease in our one to four family portfolio resulting primarily from a decrease in loans held for sale of million 
agriculture loans and farmland real estate loans decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was due to our continued reduction in exposure to the kansas and missouri agricultural markets 
installment loans at december  were million  representing a million decrease  or  from installment loans at december  of million 
installment and other consumer loans have been decreasing as a percentage of total loans over the past several years as we have placed more emphasis on growing our small to mid size business lending

the sale of the branches in june of accounted for million of the decrease in loans receivable 
net of the branch sales  loans receivable decreased million  or 
the decrease in total loans receivable was primarily due to a million decrease in our one to four family portfolio resulting from a decrease in loans held for sale as well as a reduction in the portfolio due to increased customer refinancing due to the favorable fixed rate mortgage rates 
we typically sell fixed rate one to four family loans to the secondary market instead of holding them in our portfolio 
offsetting the decrease in our one to four family loan portfolio was the favorable results of our continued allocation of resources to the commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate markets 
our commitment to focus our resources on internal loan growth in the commercial  construction and land development  and commercial real estate markets produced internal loan growth of million  a increase in these loans compared to offsetting this growth was our decision to exit our low margin dealer paper business in decreasing installment loans by million 
we also reduced our credit exposure to the kansas and missouri agricultural markets beginning in resulting in a decrease in agricultural loans of million for the year 
also contributing to the decrease in total loans receivable was the decision to exit the higher risk commercial leasing business in  which reduced lease financing receivables by million during loans secured by real estate loans secured by real estate represent our largest type of loan 
at december   these loans totaled million  a million  or  increase from million at december  the increase was generated from an million increase in commercial real estate loans and a million increase in construction and development loans 
offsetting this increase was a million decrease in one to four family loans primarily resulting from a decrease in loans held for sale 
at december   the balance of real estate mortgage loans held for sale was million  representing a million decrease from the balance at december  of million 
we typically sell fixed rate one to four family loans to the secondary market instead of holding such loans in our one to four family portfolio 
we occasionally retain the servicing rights on these loans 
capitalized servicing rights are recorded at the time the loan is sold  thereby increasing the gain on sale by such amount 
the balance of our mortgage servicing rights was  at december  compared to  at december  construction and land development loans secured by real estate increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  we have experienced steady growth in this area increasing in each of the last five years from million at december  nonfarm  nonresidential commercial loans secured by real estate increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  we have experienced steady growth in this area increasing in each of the last five years 
we anticipate continued growth in this loan portfolio with our continued emphasis on small to mid size business loans in our metropolitan markets 
at december   real estate loans totaled million  a million  or  increase from million at december  the increase was generated from a million increase in commercial real estate loans and a million increase in construction and development loans 
offsetting this increase was a million decrease in one to four family loans resulting from a decrease in loans held for sale as well as a reduction in the portfolio due to increased customer refinancing as a result of the favorable fixed rate mortgage rates 
also contributing to the offset was a decrease in real estate loans secured by farmland of million to million at december  from at december  commercial and agricultural commercial and agricultural loans were million at december   a decrease of million  or  from million at december  commercial loans include loans to service  retail  wholesale  and light manufacturing businesses

installment and other loans were million at december   a decrease of million  or from million at december  at december   installment and other loans decreased million or from million at december  installment and other loans have been decreasing as a percentage of total loans over the past several years as we have placed less emphasis in this area and more emphasis on our small to mid size business loans in our markets 
loan maturities the following tables present  at december  and  loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual repricing maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are re evaluated using substantially the same credit procedures that are used when loans are made

nonperforming loans consist of loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  nonaccrual loans  and restructured loans 
when  in the opinion of management  a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest  regardless of the delinquency status of a loan  the accrual of interest income is discontinued and any interest accrued to date is reversed through a charge to interest income 
while a loan is on nonaccrual status  it is our policy that interest income is recognized only after payment in full of the past due principal 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is days or more past due  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table presents information concerning the nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
december dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans      loans days past due and still accruing   restructured loans  nonperforming loans      other real estate owned    total nonperforming assets     nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets total nonperforming assets were million at december  compared to million at december   representing an increase of million or 
the increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans of million offset by a decrease in other real estate owned of approximately  nonperforming loans increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in nonperforming loans was a result of an increase in nonaccrual loans of million and an increase of million in restructured loans 
nonaccrual loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily a result of one large loan approximating million to a residential property developer placed on nonaccrual status in included in the million of nonaccrual loans at december  were four large loans aggregating million with specific reserves of  these loans include million with a residential property developer  million with an individual for a single family dwelling   with an underground cabling company and  with an aluminum extrusion company 
we do not anticipate losses on these credits in excess of the specific reserves 
restructured loans at december  consisted of seven relationships 
the largest relationship included agricultural lending restructured through farmer home administration of approximately  other real estate owned was million at december  compared to million at december  other real estate owned consisted of properties held by our subsidiary banks 
the properties consisted of four commercial buildings totaling  seven one to four family properties totaling  and four parcels of land totaling  the properties are all located within our market areas 
management is working to sell the real estate as soon as practical 
nonperforming assets have steadily increased from along with the increase in our total assets 
nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets increased to at december   compared to at december   and at december  nonperforming assets will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of nonperforming assets may increase if economic weaknesses are experienced in  although the magnitude of any increase in nonperforming loans is not determinable 
impaired loans we consider a loan to be impaired when it is deemed probable by management that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
however  when determining whether a loan is impaired  management also considers the loan documentation  the current ratio of the loan s balance to collateral value  and the borrower s present financial position 
included as impaired loans are all loans contractually delinquent days or more and all loans upon which accrual of interest has been suspended 
at december   we had impaired loans totaling million  which have related specific reserves of million 
this compares to million of impaired loans  which had related specific reserves of million at december  the increase in impaired loans was the result of the increase in non performing assets above 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended december  was million 
interest income recognized on impaired loans during the period the loans were considered to be impaired for approximated  impaired loans will generally increase in times of economic uncertainty or stress 
management believes the level of impaired loans could increase if economic weaknesses are experienced in our market area during allowance for loan losses management maintains its allowance for loan losses based on industry standards  historical experience and an evaluation of economic conditions 
we regularly review delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon these factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for potential loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans if their ultimate collectibility is considered questionable 
since certain lending activities involve greater risks  the percentage applied to specific loan types may vary 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
year ended december dollars in thousands average total loans     total loans at end of period     allowance at beginning of year     loans charged off real estate one to four family construction other commercial  lease financing receivables installment and other total charge offs    recoveries real estate one to four family construction other commercial lease financing receivables installment and other total recoveries net charge offs    provision for loan losses     allowance related to acquisitions allowance at end of period      ratio of net charge offs to average total loans allowance to total loans at end of period allowance to nonperforming loans the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans at december  compared to million or of total loans at december  allowance to nonperforming loans was at december  compared to at the decrease in the allowance as a percent of total loans and percent of nonperforming loans was a result of management s calculation of the estimated reserve  consistently applied from year to year  which considers historical experience  evaluation of economic conditions and knowledge of specific loans 
contributing to the decrease in the allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans was the inclusion of a loan in nonperforming loans of approximately million to a residential property developer without a corresponding increase in specific allowances as the loan was adequately collateralized by real estate 
also contributing to the decrease in the allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans was the increase in restructured loans included in nonperforming loans of million of which approximately  was a loan to an agriculture borrower  restructured through farmer home administration 
excluding the increase in restructured loans  the allowance was of nonaccrual loans and loans days or more delinquent 
net charge offs were million for the year ended compared to million for the year ended net charge offs for primarily consisted of million in commercial loan net charge offs   in installment and other loan net charge offs and  in one to four family loan net charge offs

net charge offs were million for the year ended  compared to million for the year ended net charge offs for primarily consisted of  in commercial loans   in installment loans  and  in one to four family real estate loans 
commercial loan net charge offs were primarily composed of five credits totaling  these credits were from various industries in our markets including an auto leasing company  a retail packaging manufacturer  a convenience store  an auto body shop  and fraudulent receivables purchased 
one to four family net charge offs were also the result of one larger credit  where we released the mortgage in error and the customer filed for bankruptcy 
installment net charge offs have increased over the past few years at approximately of installment net charge offs to total installment loans 
we also exited the dealer paper business and sold our credit card portfolio during as a result  the net charge off percentage for installment loans has improved to for  compared to for our lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the loan portfolio 
additionally we have a separate loan review process  which reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine compliance with loan policy  including the appropriateness of risk ratings assigned to individual loans  as well as the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based primarily on management s estimates of probable loan losses from the foregoing processes and historical experience 
the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
management believes that the table may be a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowances as a whole 
the table has been derived in part by applying historical loan loss ratios to both internally classified loans and the portfolio as a whole to determine the allocation of the loan losses attributable to each category of loans

the allowance for loan losses allocated to one to four family increased approximately  at december  compared to december  due to assignment of specific reserves to certain loans included in this category 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to other loans secured by real estate increased approximately  due to the increase in loans in that category of approximately 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to commercial and agricultural loans decreased approximately  due to a decrease in agricultural loans of approximately million or 
the decrease in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses allocated to installment and other loans of approximately  is due to the decrease in the loan balance in that category of million or 
investments we invest a portion of our available funds in short term and long term instruments  including federal funds sold and investment securities 
our investment portfolio is designed to provide liquidity for cash flow requirements  to assist in managing interest rate risk  and to provide collateral for certain public deposits and other borrowing arrangement 
at december  and  the investment portfolio was comprised principally of obligations of us government agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  and mortgage backed securities 
total investment securities at december  of million decreased million from total investments at december  of million 
the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in mortgage backed securities of million offset by an increase in us government agency securities of million

the federal home loan bank borrowings  which carry an average rate of  consisted of million in year fixed rate advances convertible to floating rate advances if libor increases to within the next years and million in year fixed rate advances convertible to floating rate advances if libor increases to within the next years 
the intent of the transaction was to increase the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to benefit from an increase in interest rates and borrow long term borrowings during the period of historical low interest rates 
the cumulative net result of this transaction from through was net interest income of approximately  the following table presents our investments in certain securities accounted for as available for sale

capital resources we monitor compliance with bank and financial holding company regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on risk based guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent upon the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet  and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital

 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
fin provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s financial statements 
vies are generally defined in fin as entities that either do not have sufficient equity to finance their activities without support from other parties or whose equity investors lack a controlling financial interest

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies  measures and discloses in its financial statements certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that an issuer classify financial instruments that are within its scope as a liability  in most circumstances 
such financial instruments include i financial instruments that are issued in the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable  ii financial instruments that embody an obligation to repurchase the issuer s equity shares  or are indexed to such an obligation and that require the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets  iii financial instruments that embody an obligation that the issuers settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligations is predominately based on a fixed amount  variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity share or variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares  and iv certain freestanding financial instruments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity we continuously forecast and manage our liquidity in order to satisfy cash flow requirements of depositors  borrowers  and our own cash flow needs 
we have developed internal and external sources of liquidity to meet our continued growth needs 
these include  but are not limited to  the ability to raise deposits through branch promotional campaigns  maturity of overnight funds  short term investment securities classified as available for sale and draws on credit facilities established through the federal home loan bank 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december  and december   these liquid assets totaled million and million  respectively 
management believes our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
asset and liability management asset and liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities 
controlling the maturity of repricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of repricing assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
we monitor our assets and liability mix monthly in an effort to maintain consistent earnings performance through control of interest rate risk 
below is a static gap schedule as of december  this is just one of several tools which may be used to measure and manage interest rate sensitivity 
interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented below within selected time intervals based on their repricing and maturity characteristics 
in this view  the sensitivity position is perfectly matched when an equal amount of assets and liabilities reprice during any given time period 
excess assets or liabilities repricing in a given time period results in the interest rate gap shown in the table 
a positive gap indicates more assets than liabilities will reprice in that time period  while a negative gap indicates more liabilities than assets will reprice 
static gap analysis at december  months or loss through months through months through months through months more than months total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable  net of unearned income    investment securities available for sale    federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits  other assets total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities savings deposits and interest bearing checking  time deposits under      time deposits over      federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal home loan bank advances    notes payable and subordinated debentures  total interest bearing liabilities    periodic repricing gap     cumulative repricing gap     periodic repricing gap as a percent of interest earning assets cumulative repricing gap as a percent of interest earning assets the table indicates that we are liability sensitive in the less than three month period  the four through month period  and the through month period  and are asset sensitive for all other periods 
this means that during the first two period classifications  interest bearing liabilities reprice faster than interest earning assets  thereby improving net interest income when rates are falling and reducing net interest income when rates are rising 
while the static gap method is a widely used measure of interest sensitivity  it is not  in management s opinion  the only indicator of our rate sensitivity 
the following table indicates that at december   if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  our net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in net interest income 
change in interest rates net interest income decrease increase percent change dollar in thousands basis point rise   basis point rise  base rate scenario  basis point decline   basis point decline   we believe we are appropriately positioned for future interest rate movements  although we may experience fluctuations in net interest income due to short term timing differences between the repricing of assets and liabilities
