item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
t was incorporated in october during the year  we acquired five operating companies in transactions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
on february   we acquired cor val for approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed and the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
on april   we acquired preferred industries for approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed and the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
on april   we acquired o m equipment  inc for approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed and a maximum earnout of million based on the performance of o m through million was earned in  million was earned in  and million was earned in 
additionally  we acquired control products of louisiana  inc and coastal electric motors  inc 
in september and december  respectively  for total consideration of approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed 
the results of operations of these companies have been included in our operating results from the dates of acquisition 
on may   simultaneous with the signing of the merger agreement with ihi  we acquired a b bolt  inc  a subsidiary of ihi  for million in cash including expenses in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations of a b bolt have been included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
on december   t energy services  inc  a private delaware corporation former t  merged into ihi  a texas corporation  with ihi surviving the merger 
in connection with the merger  the combined company was reincorporated in delaware under the name t energy services  inc and implemented a one for ten reverse stock split of its common stock 
the merger was treated for accounting purposes as a purchase of ihi by former t a reverse acquisition in a purchase business transaction 
the purchase method of accounting requires that we carry forward former t s net assets at their historical book values and reflect ihi s net assets at their estimated fair market values  with the fair market value of the purchase consideration in excess of the fair market value of ihi s identifiable net assets treated as goodwill 
the historical financial data presented in this annual report on form k includes the historical financial condition and operating results of t prior to its merger with ihi 
for the year  the historical financial data also includes the two weeks of operations of the combined company from december  to december  as part of the merger with ihi  we acquired a non energy subsidiary 
because the subsidiary s operations were outside our strategic focus  at the time of the merger  we identified this operation as one to be sold 
the sale was completed in july on december   our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the new symbol ttes 
immediately after the merger  first reserve fund viii  lp first reserve owned approximately of our common shares  and collectively all of the former t stockholders including first reserve owned approximately of our common shares  with the remaining of our common shares being held by the stockholders of ihi immediately prior to the merger 
before the closing and as part of the merger  ihi divested of substantially all of its non energy related subsidiaries  sjmb  lp converted million of its ihi debt into shares of ihi common stock  first reserve converted million of its former t debt into shares of former t common stock  and first reserve purchased an additional million in shares of former t common stock 
in addition  the combined company completed a refinancing of its senior debt simultaneously with the closing of the merger 
under the terms of the merger  all but two of ihi s then existing directors and all of its officers resigned their positions with the combined company  and the management of former t and six of former t s director designees assumed the management and director duties for the combined company 
in mid year  we hired a new management team and began to evaluate our various existing businesses and products to determine t s future strategic direction  and to improve return on stockholder investment and position t for future growth 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a formal plan to sell certain non core assets within our products segment 
the sale of these assets was consummated in february the assets sold comprised substantially all of the assets of lss lone star houston inc  bolt manufacturing co  inc d b a walker bolt manufacturing company and whir acquisition  inc 
d b a ameritech manufacturing  collectively  the businesses 
the businesses primarily manufacture and distribute a broad line of standard and metric fasteners  in addition to manufacturing specialty fasteners and parts in small quantities for the commercial and aerospace industries as well as the military 
pursuant to the asset sale agreement  the buyer purchased all of the assets of the businesses for a purchase price of million  subject to a working capital adjustment after closing 
we received million in cash on february   which was immediately used to pay down our wells fargo term loan see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we received two promissory notes in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we did not record these two notes as their ultimate collection is contingent upon the occurrence of certain specified events which management believes are not probable of occurring 
at december   these assets constituted a business and thus were held for sale 
accordingly  their results of operations were reported as discontinued operations 
goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million  net of tax  based upon a pending sales contract 
included in this loss was a goodwill impairment charge of million and a long lived asset impairment of million 
the assets sold were acquired as part of the ihi merger that occurred on december  the results of operations and cash flows for for these assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  our new management team completed its evaluation of each of the business segment s product lines and service revenues for expected performance in the forthcoming years and formulated a new business strategy and operating plan 
management based its expectations for t s future performance on current market conditions and on each of the business segment s potential to maximize the value of the overall business by either expansion or growth of product lines and services  internally and through acquisitions  and in both the domestic and international markets 
we reevaluated our expectations for the earnings  growth and contribution of the products segment for and concluded that the segment would still generate revenues and earnings and contribute positively to t s consolidated results of operations and cash flows but at a much reduced level 
this determination was based on the continued softness in the gulf of mexico upstream and downstream oil and gas industry as well as lower revenues generated from larger fabricated equipment and component revenues 
in addition  we expect lower revenues from the electrical motor and generator repair and storage business 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million on goodwill attributable to our products segment 
management s business strategy is to continue to expand and grow our product lines and services in both existing and strategically acquired domestic and international operations 
this will be accomplished by acquiring products and services that complement each other in the manufacturing  aftermarket and service arenas 
in addition  to increase the volume of our products growth  we plan to improve and expand on our international agency agreements 
to promote quality and excellence to our customers  we have increased our engineering group to improve and expand on our existing product lines in addition to any future products we may develop or acquire 
we plan to expand our higher margin after market services by promoting rapid response to customer needs and promote intercompany coordination through combined sales efforts 
finally  we continue to improve our existing operations through the integration and consolidation of our facilities

demand for our products and services is cyclical and dependent upon activity in the oil and gas industry and the profitability  cash flow and willingness of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors to spend capital on the exploration  development and production of oil and gas reserves in the gulf of mexico and the united states gulf coast regions where our products and services are primarily sold 
the level of exploration and production  our primary driver  especially in the gulf of mexico  is highly sensitive to current and projected oil and natural gas prices  which have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
over the last several years  the united states drilling rig count has fluctuated due to world economic and political trends that influence the supply and demand for energy  the price of oil and natural gas and the level of exploration and drilling for those commodities 
the united states drilling rig count remained stable throughout the second half of  before increasing steadily throughout however  the average gulf of mexico rig count for was below the average rig count for and had declined slightly from higher average levels in late the level of revenue improvement for us in the future will continue to be heavily dependent upon the timing and strength of the recovery in the gulf of mexico market and our gains in market share outside the gulf of mexico 
the speed and extent of any recovery in these markets is difficult to predict in light of continued economic uncertainty 
as illustrated in the table above  the market price of oil and gas alone is not an indicator of a recovery in these markets 
many external factors  including world economic and political conditions  quotas established by opec organization of petroleum exporting countries and weather conditions  will influence the recovery and continued strength of the industry 
based on our assessment of external factors and our current levels of inquiry and quotation  we believe that continuing price and general economic uncertainty will cause near term activity levels to remain flat for the first half of results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating statement data for each of our segments for each of the years presented in thousands for the years ended december  revenues pressure control    products    distribution    cost of revenues pressure control    products    distribution    gross profit pressure control    products    distribution    operating expenses pressure control    products    distribution    corporate    income loss from operations pressure control    products  distribution    corporate    year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
on a consolidated basis  revenues increased million  or  in compared to this increase was attributable to an improved united states onshore rig count  increased market penetration for our pressure control products and services  and increased revenues in the distribution segment resulting from several large customer projects 
these increases were negatively impacted by continued softness in the gulf of mexico drilling rig activity  continued pricing pressure for our products and services and lower revenues from artificial lift systems and larger fabricated equipment and components for use in the exploration and production of oil and gas  especially in the gulf of mexico 
revenues for the pressure control segment increased million  or  in compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to revenue increases associated with the increased united states onshore rig count and a slight increase in market share for our pressure control products and services

gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in the decrease in gross profit margin was due to pricing pressure for our products and services  increased insurance and self insured medical costs  a shift in product mix to lower margin items and the temporarily higher than normal manufacturing costs of one of our new manufactured pressure control products 
we anticipate that the costs of manufacturing this new product will decrease in future periods and benefit our operations 
cost of revenues for the products segment decreased million  or  in compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in gross profit margin decreased primarily as a result of pricing pressure for our products and services  increased insurance and self insured medical costs  and a change in the revenue mix of products and services sold  with a greater percentage of revenues consisting of lower margin products revenues when compared to higher margin service revenues in the prior period 
cost of revenues for the distribution segment increased million  or  in compared to  primarily due to the increase in revenues in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in gross profit margin decreased primarily because of pricing pressure for our products  startup costs associated with the sale and distribution of a new valve automation product line and initial costs associated with new distribution facilities located in houston and beaumont  texas

operating expenses for the distribution segment increased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses remained at in both and operating expenses for the corporate operations increased million  or  in compared to this was primarily attributable to an increase in costs associated with relocation and compensation expenses for new management  the recognition of severance payments to former management  the integration of the former ihi operating units into t  and professional fees

principal debt instruments 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million borrowed under our principal bank credit facility and other bank financings 
as of december   as a result of the funded debt to ebitda ratio covenant  as defined in the credit agreement  our availability under our revolving credit facility was limited to million 
on december   we entered into a senior credit facility with wells fargo  na and general electric capital corporation maturing december  concurrently  we entered into a million subordinated term loan with wells fargo energy capital  inc maturing december  the senior credit facility includes a revolving credit facility of the lesser of a defined borrowing base based upon of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory or million  a term loan of million and an optional facility for up to an additional million in the form of a revolving credit commitment for future acquisitions based upon specific criteria 
the senior credit facility s term loan is payable in equal quarterly installments of million 
the applicable interest rate of the senior credit facility is governed by our trailing twelve month funded debt to ebitda ratio and ranges from prime plus or libor plus to prime plus or libor plus 
at december   the senior credit facility bore interest at libor plus  with interest payable quarterly 
we are required to prepay the senior credit facility under certain circumstances with the net cash proceeds of asset sales  insurance proceeds  equity issuances and institutional debt  and if  and for so long as  our funded debt to ebitda ratio is to or greater  with of excess cash flow as determined under the senior credit agreement 
in connection with the sale of certain assets of the products segment in february see note to our consolidated financial statements  we used the net proceeds to pay down the wells fargo term loan 
the remaining balance of the loan was concurrently paid off with other funds 
the senior credit facility provides  among other covenants and restrictions  that we comply with certain financial covenants  including a limitation on capital expenditures  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio 
the senior credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets

the subordinated term loan bears interest at a fixed rate of with interest payable quarterly 
the principal balance is due in full on december  the effective interest rate  including amortization of loan costs  is

we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our senior credit facility and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund existing operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and financing obligations 
we also believe any significant increase in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through debt financing 
we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of our senior credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with an acquisition 
however  acquisition funds may not be available at terms acceptable to us 
a summary of our outstanding contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt    operating leases     total contractual obligations     related parties we have transactions in the normal course of business with certain related parties 
except as noted below  management believes these transactions were made at the prevailing market rates or terms 
on september   we entered into a  million convertible subordinated note payable to first reserve 
in may  we entered into a  million convertible promissory note payable to first reserve 
the proceeds of the note were used to fund our acquisition of a b bolt 
in december  the two convertible promissory notes and accrued interest in the aggregate amount of million were converted into million shares of common stock 
interest expense on these two notes was million for the year ended december  in  we sold million shares of common stock to an executive officer and a director of the company for cash proceeds of million 
on march   we sold million shares of our common stock at per share to our largest stockholder  first reserve 
the per share price was at a premium to our then recent trading history 
our common stock closed at per share on march  general electric capital corporation is a beneficial owner of  shares of our common stock see note to our consolidated financial statements  and provides debt financing to us 
in connection with this financing  we paid financing costs of approximately million and incurred interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  prior to the merger of t and ihi  ihi sold one of its subsidiaries to an entity controlled by don carlin and robert cone  and ihi received a million note receivable from the former subsidiary as part of its purchase price see note to our consolidated financial statements 
mr 
carlin is a former director  and mr 
cone is a former executive officer and director of the company 
as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we determined in that this note receivable was uncollectible and wrote off million as other expense 
we lease certain buildings under noncancelable operating leases from related parties 
lease commitments under these leases are approximately million for rent expense to related parties was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inflation although we believe that inflation has not had any material effect on operating results  our business may be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the sale and performance of our products and services 
we believe that our business is not subject to any significant seasonal factors  and do not anticipate significant seasonality in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to our reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates are described below 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount  net of write offs and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our receivables are exposed to concentrations of credit risk since a majority of our business is conducted with companies in the oil and gas  petrochemical  chemical and petroleum refining industries in the gulf coast region 
we continually monitor collections and evaluate the financial strength of our customers but do not require collateral to support our domestic customer receivables 
we may require collateral to support our international customer receivables  if any 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential collection issues in addition to reserves for specific accounts receivable where collection is no longer probable 
we cannot give assurances that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past or that our losses will not exceed the amount reserved 
inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and slow moving inventory to write down the recorded cost of inventory to its fair market value 
this analysis is based primarily on the length of time the item has remained in inventory and management s consideration of current and expected market conditions 
however  a significant decrease in demand and a further weakening of market conditions could result in further writedowns in inventory carrying values and a charge to earnings 
long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used by us are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
assets are classified as held for sale when the company has a plan for disposal of certain assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria of sfas no 
at december   we assessed the assets of continuing operations of the products segment 
as of december  and  no significant impairment had occurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and represents a significant portion of our assets 
identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon fair market value at the date of acquisition 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard changes the accounting for goodwill and certain other intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
the standard also requires a reassessment of the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill and at least an annual test for impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives 
during  we completed the transitional goodwill and indefinite life intangibles impairment tests as well as the annual impairment tests required by sfas no 
during  our calculations indicated the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and  accordingly  goodwill and indefinite life intangibles were not impaired 
our annual tests of impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are performed as of december the fair values of our reporting units were determined based on the reporting units projected discounted cash flow and publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples of comparable businesses 
in mid year  we hired a new management team and began to evaluate our various existing businesses and products to determine t s future strategic direction  and to improve return on stockholder investment and position t for future growth 
in the fourth quarter of  our new management team completed its evaluation of each of the business segment s product lines and service revenues for expected performance in the forthcoming years and formulated a new business strategy and operating plan 
management based its expectations for t s future performance on current market conditions and on each of the business segment s potential to maximize the value of the overall business by either expansion or growth of product lines and services  internally and through acquisitions  and in both the domestic and international markets 
in december  the board of directors approved management s business strategy and annual operating plan 
in connection with the disposition of certain non core assets see note to our consolidated financial statements  we reevaluated our expectations for the earnings  growth and contribution of the products segment for and concluded that the segment would still generate revenues and earnings and contribute positively to t s consolidated results of operations and cash flows but at a much reduced level 
this determination was based on the continued softness in the gulf of mexico upstream and downstream oil and gas industry as well as lower revenues generated from larger fabricated equipment and component revenues 
in addition  we expect lower revenues from the electrical motor and generator repair and storage business 
accordingly  at december   we assessed the realizability of the company s recorded goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
our analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired for the remaining businesses within the products segment as their carrying value was greater than fair value 
we then performed a discounted cash flow analysis and used other market methods to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill and intangibles 
this assessment indicated that goodwill of million was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge in continuing operations 
we will continue to test on a consistent measurement date unless events occur or circumstances change between annual impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
management s business strategy is to continue to expand and grow its product lines and services in both existing and strategically acquired domestic and international operations 
this will be accomplished by acquiring products and services that complement each other in the manufacturing  aftermarket and service arenas 
in addition  to increase the volume of our products growth  we plan to improve and expand on our international agency agreements 
to promote quality and excellence to our customers  we have increased our engineering group to improve and expand on our existing product lines in addition to any future products we may develop or acquire 
we plan to expand our higher margin after market services by promoting rapid response to customer needs and promote intercompany coordination through combined sales efforts 
finally  we continue to improve our existing operations through the integration and consolidation of our facilities 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
we operate in a number of domestic tax jurisdictions under various legal forms 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events 
changes in tax laws and regulations or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends upon the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
this requires us to use estimates and make assumptions regarding significant future events such as the taxability of entities operating in the various taxing jurisdictions 
when the likelihood of the realization of existing deferred tax assets changes  adjustments to the valuation allowance are charged  in the period in which the determination is made  either to income or goodwill  depending upon when that portion of the valuation allowance was originally created 
in addition  we have identified various domestic tax planning strategies we would implement  if necessary  to enable the realization of our deferred tax assets

 reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  will now be used to classify those gains and losses

in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks and rewards of ownership among their owners and other parties involved 
the provisions of interpretation no 
are applicable immediately to all variable interest entities created after january  and require certain disclosures for all variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb published a revision to fin fin r to clarify some of the provisions of the interpretation and to defer the effective date of implementation for certain entities created before january  under the guidance of fin r  entities that do not have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities spes are required to apply the provisions of the interpretation in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of the provisions applicable to spes and all other variable interests obtained after january  did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for all other interests  we are currently evaluating the impact this interpretation will have  but do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
other new accounting pronouncements effective during did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating interest rate under our revolving credit facility and certain of our term debt 
as of december   our revolving credit facility had no principal balance and our variable long term debt had a principal balance of million  with interest rates that float with prime or libor 
a increase in interest rates could result in a million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances
