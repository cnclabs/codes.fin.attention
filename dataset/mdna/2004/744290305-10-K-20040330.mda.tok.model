introduction we are the nation s second largest provider based electronic healthcare transaction services company 
we provide connectivity services and related value added products to physicians  payers  pharmacies  medical laboratories  and other healthcare providers and suppliers 
our services support a broad range of financial  clinical and administrative transactions  and are hipaa certified through claredi  an independent certification and testing services company specializing in hipaa compliance 
to facilitate these services  we operate phoenixtm  our secure national electronic information platform  which provides physicians and other healthcare providers with direct connectivity to one of the industry s largest list of payers  the industry s largest list of chain and independent pharmacies and the largest list of clinical laboratories 
our corporate headquarters is located in atlanta  georgia  and our products and services are provided from various operational facilities located throughout the united states 
we also operate our clinical computer network and portions of our financial and real time production computer networks from a secure  third party co location site also located in atlanta  georgia 
all of our revenues are generated domestically 
our primary strategy is focused on leveraging our leading position as an independent back end connectivity provider to small physician offices 
through strategic relationships and partnerships with front end solution providers  our goal is to drive more healthcare transactions through phoenixtm while remaining neutral in the battle for the physician s desktop 
additionally  we expect that there will be opportunities to increase revenues by cross selling our existing products and services to our current customer base of physicians and other healthcare providers  as well as revenue opportunities from the development of new services from our development efforts  including internet based transaction services 
we remain committed to developing additional capabilities and value added products and services  and to expanding our back end connectivity network 
in conjunction with this philosophy  we have recently introduced proxymed 
net  our new web portal for providers  and phoenixtm  our new transaction processing platform which has been hipaa certified through claredi 
we have also added new services offerings for our payer customers through agreements with planvista corporation planvista for claims re pricing services and first data corporation for a jointly marketed suite of services being offered under the brand name firstproxy 
acquisitions on december   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of medunite  inc medunite for million in cash and an aggregate of million principal amount of convertible promissory notes 
in addition  we paid approximately million in transaction and exit related costs which were originally estimated at million 
interest on the convertible notes is payable in cash on a quarterly basis 
the convertible promissory notes now currently payable at a maturity value of million after a claim setoff against the escrow in december are payable in full on december   and are convertible into an aggregate of  shares originally  shares before the claim setoff of our common stock if the former shareholders of medunite achieve certain revenue based triggers over the next three and one half year period 
the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes will be registered by us promptly after a conversion trigger event is met 
the first threshold trigger was reached during the fourth quarter of and the convertible notes were reduced to million at december  as a result of a claim against the escrow 
the operations of medunite are reflected with our operations for the twelve months ended december  additionally  we spent much of the year integrating the operations of medunite into our existing operations and currently the organizations are run and managed as one operating unit 
as a result  meaningful separate results and statistics for medunite are no longer available 
on march   a merger was consummated by and among proxymed  planet acquisition corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of proxymed that was formed solely to effect the merger and planvista a company that provides medical cost containment and business process outsourcing solutions for the medical insurance and managed care industries  as well as services for health care providers  including individual providers  preferred provider organizations and other provider groups 
in connection with this merger  our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares of the company s common stock from  shares to  shares  the issuance of  shares of our common stock at per share in a private equity offering valued at million to retire debt of planvista and pay certain expenses associated with the merger  the issuance of  shares of our common stock in connection with the merger  and an amendment to our stock option plan to increase the total number of shares available for issuance from  to  upon completion of the merger  each share of planvista s outstanding common stock was cancelled and converted into the right to receive of a share of our common stock and each holder of planvista series c preferred stock received shares of our common stock in exchange for each share of planvista series c preferred stock  representing approximately of our common stock on a fully converted basis  and the holders of our outstanding stock  options and warrants retained approximately of proxymed 
planvista will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and its operations will be included in our transaction services segment commencing march as described above  to acquire planvista we issued  shares of our common stock to planvista shareholders valued at million based on the closing price of our common stock on march   we assumed debt and other liabilities of planvista  and we estimated approximately million in acquisition related costs 
additionally  we raised in a private placement sale of our common stock to partially fund repayment of planvista s debts and other obligations outstanding at the time of the acquisition 
the merger enables us to enter into a new line of business  provide new end to end services  increase sales opportunities with payers  strengthen business ties with certain customers  expand technological capabilities  reduce operating costs and enhance our public profile 
operating segments we operate in two reportable segments that are separately managed transaction services formerly known as electronic healthcare transaction processing and laboratory communication solutions 
transaction services includes transaction and value added services principally between physicians and insurance companies payer services and physicians and pharmacies prescription services  and laboratory communication solutions includes the sale  lease and service of communication devices principally to laboratories and the contract manufacturing of printed circuit boards laboratory services 
the results for the transaction services and laboratory communication solutions segments do not include an allocation of corporate overhead in assessing the operating performance of the respective segments 
commencing in march  the operations of planvista will be included in our transaction services segment medical cost containment services 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
consolidated net revenues for increased by million  or  to million from consolidated net revenues of million for net revenues classified by our reportable segments are as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions net revenues in our transaction services segment formerly known as electronic healthcare transaction processing increased by over the period 
this increase was driven by strong internal growth and more significantly by transactions generated by medunite 
total healthcare transactions grew from million transactions in the period to million transactions in core transaction growth is up from the period 
the increase in transaction volume was primarily attributable to the medunite acquisition and internal growth in both claims and statements processed 
while our encounter volume remained flat between the periods  the net increases were generally the result of transactions acquired from medunite and new sales  including transactions generated by new vendor partners that resulted in greater claim and patient statement processing transactions 
a summary of the number of transactions we processed for the periods presented is as follows in thousands core transactions encounters total transactions core transactions represent all transactions except for encounters 
encounters are an administrative reporting transaction for payers but do not generate revenue for the provider who must submit them 
accordingly  rather than submitting on a routine basis  most providers choose to periodically catch up on their submissions  creating monthly and quarterly swings in both the number of encounters we process and what percentage of our transaction mix they represent 
since encounters are at a significantly lower price point than claims  these swings make it difficult to easily analyze our quarter over quarter growth in our core business 
in addition  we do not expect our encounter volume to grow on an annual basis  as payers are not expanding the capitated service model that is the foundation of encounters 
therefore  we believe that breaking out encounters shows more clearly our growth in core transactions  which are the growth engine for our transaction services segment 
for the period  approximately of our revenues came from our transaction services processing segment  compared to from this segment for laboratory communication solutions segment s net revenues decreased by from the period 
as the sluggish economy continued throughout  we have seen a slowdown in contract manufacturing sales and sales of communication devices at our smaller labs and hospital labs 
additionally  beginning in  we lost a customer in our contract manufacturing business that represented approximately of this segments revenues 
our future goals for this business include creating new opportunities with existing customers with our report tracker product and capitalizing on our relationships for transaction based solutions 
cost of sales 
consolidated cost of sales decreased from of net revenues in to in cost of sales classified by our reportable segments is as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions cost of sales in our transaction services segment consists of transaction fees  services and license fees  third party electronic transaction processing costs  certain telecommunication and co location center costs  revenue sharing arrangements with our business partners  third party database licenses  and certain labor and certain travel expenses 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in this segment was in the period compared to in the same period last year primarily due to a change in the mix of transaction types from higher cost patient statements to lower cost sales of data and claims and real time transactions such as eligibility verification through additional transactions acquired from medunite 
in  we reclassified direct labor and manufacturing overhead from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of tangible products sold to better reflect the production of tangible products 
all prior periods have a similar reclassification 
as a result  cost of sales in the laboratory communication solutions segment includes hardware  third party software  consumable materials  direct manufacturing labor and indirect manufacturing overhead 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in this segment increased to for compared to for primarily due to a change in the mix from lower cost leases to higher cost contract manufacturing 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
consolidated sg a increased for by million  or  to million from consolidated sg a of for consolidated sg a expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased to for compared to in sg a expenses classified by our reportable segments are as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions corporate sg a expenses in the transaction services segment increased during over the same period last year  primarily due to the incremental expenses incurred in the operations of medunite  costs related to our hipaa compliance efforts  implementation staffing and sales marketing programs implemented since last year 
segment sg a expenses as a percentage of segment net revenues increased to for compared to in due to the higher expense run rate in the medunite operations earlier in the period compared to our existing business 
while we incurred significant sg a costs related to the medunite operations in the first quarter of  we were successful at significantly reducing the monthly operating expenses in the second and third quarters of and thus achieving much improved results in the second half of the year 
we were successful in eliminating or renegotiating substantial telecommunication expenses and duplicative contact management  human resources and customer relationship management systems 
however  this improvement was somewhat offset as the development projects related to the integration of medunite were moved into production resulting in a decrease in the amount of capitalized development related to our real time and phoenixtm platforms 
by the end of the period based on our unaudited fourth quarter results  sg a expenses in this segment were of segment revenues and indicative of the run rate we expected for a combined operation 
sg a expenses in our laboratory communications solutions segment decreased by in the period from the same period last year primarily due to cost cutting measures implemented in the third quarter of segment sg a expenses as a percentage of segment net revenues remained the same at for both periods 
corporate sg a expenses increased for the period compared to same period of last year due to increased insurance premiums  professional fees and personnel costs 
we expect our corporate sg a expenses to increase in as a result of our compliance efforts related to the sarbanes oxley act of and financial systems consolidation plans for depreciation and amortization 
consolidated depreciation and amortization increased by million to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to million for the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the medunite acquisition  which includes amortization of proxymed 
net  our real time network based on the technology platform acquired from medunite  and the amortization of the customer relationships acquired from medunite 
amortization of intangible assets related to additional capitalized software development increased in late as we placed the phoenixtm platform into production and commenced the amortization of this asset 
depreciation and amortization classified by our reportable segments is as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions corporate loss on disposal of assets 
as a result of the consolidation of the proxymed and medunite offices in atlanta during  we recorded million in net losses primarily related to the disposition of certain assets owned and leased that were acquired in the acquisition of mdp corporation in gain loss on disposal of assets classified by our reportable segments is as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions corporate write off of impaired and obsolete assets

during  we wrote off  in capitalized programming costs in connection with the development of our real time transaction processing applications as a result of acquiring the same functionality in the software platforms acquired from medunite 
these write offs are expected to lower amortization expense by million in impairment charges classified by our reportable segments are as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions operating income loss 
as a result of the foregoing  consolidated operating loss for was million compared to operating income of million for operating income loss classified by our reportable segments is as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions corporate interest income expense  net 
consolidated net interest expense was million compared to net interest income of million for this increase in expense is primarily due to interest related to proxymed s convertible debt issued to the former owners of medunite and the financing of certain liabilities of medunite during the period  and lower interest income earned on a smaller investment base at lower interest rates 
other income expense  net 
in conjunction with our distribution and marketing agreement with planvista for claims re pricing services signed in june  we received a warrant to purchase up to of planvista common stock that expired in december the warrant was initially valued at million and recorded as an asset 
during the term the warrant was outstanding  the value of the warrant was evaluated at the end of each calendar quarter 
on september   the value of the warrant increased to approximately million primarily as a result of an increase in the market value of planvista common stock and this increase was reflected as other income in the statement of operations during the third quarter of upon expiration of the warrant in december  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of million resulting in a net impairment loss in the amount of million representing the original value of the warrant for the year 
net income loss 
as a result of the foregoing  consolidated net loss for was million compared to net income of million for deemed dividends and other charges

as a result of the foregoing  we reported net loss applicable to common shareholders of million for compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of million for year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
consolidated net revenues for increased by million or  to million from consolidated net revenues of million for net revenues classified by our reportable segments are as follows in thousands transaction services laboratory communication solutions net revenues in our transaction services segment increased by primarily due to a increase in the number of electronic clinical and financial healthcare transactions processed through phoenix previously called proxynet 
total transactions grew from million transactions in the period to million transactions in core transaction growth is up from the period 
the increase in transaction volume was primarily attributable to internal growth in both claims and statements processed 
additionally  we continued to make progress in our cross selling efforts to our existing customers resulting in an increase of transaction services utilized per directly contracted provider from a estimated in to in a summary of the number of transactions we processed for the periods presented is as follows in thousands core transactions encounters total transactions core transactions represent all transactions except for encounters

in addition  we do not expect our encounter volume to grow on an annual basis  as payers are not expanding the capitated service model that is the foundation of encounters 
therefore  we believe that breaking out encounters shows more clearly our growth in core transactions  which are the growth engine for our transaction services segment 
we exited the year on an annualized run rate of over million total transactions for proxymed on a stand alone basis 
the acquisition of medunite added another million transactions  therefore  we exited with a combined annualized run rate of almost million total transactions 
for  approximately of our revenues came from our transaction services segment  compared to from this segment for laboratory communication solutions net revenues increased by primarily due to the acquisition of kencom and an increase in contract manufacturing revenues  offset by decreases in sales and leases of communication devices  and field service revenues

these increases were offset by the capitalization of payroll and other costs for hipaa and private label internal use software projects for segment sg a expenses as a percentage of segment net revenues decreased to for compared to for due to the operational leverage inherent in the business 
as we increase the number of transactions we process  we do not experience a direct correlation in our costs due to the semi fixed nature of operating expenses in this segment

cash used for investing activities totaled million and consisted primarily of payments of costs related to the acquisition of medunite  capital expenditures and capitalized software 
cash used in financing activities totaled million mainly due to repayments of notes payable  other long term debt  and payments related to capital leases 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million 
during this period  we paid million million cash less million cash acquired  in addition to million now million after a claim against the portion held in escrow in convertible notes due december for our acquisition of medunite  we paid million million adjusted cash purchase price less million cash acquired  in addition to  shares of our common stock valued at million for our acquisition of kencom  we paid million for our acquisition of mdip  paid million for our acquisition of customer relationships from claimsnet 
com  paid in full our million promissory note for our acquisition of mdp  and paid million for fixed assets and capitalized software 
these activities were principally financed through a private placement of our common stock valued at million resulting in net proceeds to us of million in april  proceeds of million from the exercise of  series b warrants  and available cash resources 
we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million as of december  compared to million at december  these available funds will be used for operations  strategic acquisitions  the further development of our products and services  and other general corporate purposes 
we continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities and strategic alternatives that may add synergies to our product offerings and business strategy 
on march   we acquired planvista through the issuance of million shares of our common stock valued at million 
in addition  we raised an additional million in a private placement sale of our common stock and drew down million on our asset based line of credit 
these funds  along with available cash resources  were used to satisfy million of planvista s debt and other obligations outstanding as of the effective time of the acquisition 
at the current time  we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures except for the final installment related to the licensing of software for use in our internal systems in the amount of million due in the first quarter of we expect to incur million for various development projects scheduled to be undertaken by us in including million related to projects at planvista 
additionally  we anticipate spending approximately million including the licensing commitment above and million at planvista primarily for hardware and software costs related to enhancements to our technical infrastructure and administrative systems 
at the time we acquired medunite at the end of  medunite had incurred significant losses since its inception and was utilizing cash significantly in excess of amounts it was generating primarily due to technical and research and development activities related to their various processing platforms 
as a result  there were substantial liabilities and obligations as well as future commitments both known and unknown at december  associated with the business in addition to the transaction and exit costs associated with the acquisition 
in an effort to immediately curtail and reduce the expenditure levels  medunite s senior management team was terminated along with approximately of the general workforce  and in february  and we moved our atlanta facility into medunite s norcross facility 
while we did not achieve the expected reductions in medunite s cost early in the first quarter  we did exit the first quarter on an expense run rate in line with our expectations 
furthermore  during the second and third quarters of  we continued expense reductions by successfully eliminating or renegotiating substantial telecommunication expenses and eliminating duplicative contact management  human resources and customer relationship management systems 
additionally  in april  we terminated the san diego facility lease effective july  in return for a million letter of credit held by the current landlord and furniture at the facility 
by december   we had paid all but million of the transaction and exit costs associated with the medunite acquisition 
as a result of our negotiations  the original million in transaction and exit costs were ultimately settled for approximately million  representing a savings of million 
additionally  other medunite contractual obligations have been canceled or renegotiated with the respective vendors 
we have entered into financing agreements with certain major vendors as a means of settling liabilities that existed at december   and to date have financed million of liabilities to one vendor  million in net liabilities to a former owner of medunite  and million for a required insurance policy as part of the acquisition 
between these financing agreements  existing capital leases  and the convertible notes issued in the acquisition  we incurred significant interest expense charges in in december  we closed on a million asset based line of credit with our commercial bank 
borrowing under such facility is subject to eligible cash  accounts receivable  and inventory and other conditions 
borrowings bear interest at the prime rate plus or at libor plus or libor plus in the case of borrowings against eligible cash only 
as of december   there were no borrowings against this line of credit 
however  as a result of our acquisition of planvista  we drew down million against this line at the end of february at this time  the assets of planvista are not eligible collateral for this line of credit due to covenants of the senior debt in place at planvista 
as noted above  with our acquisition of planvista on march   we utilized the million in proceeds raised from our private placement  drew million on our line of credit and used available cash to satisfy million of planvista s debt and other obligations outstanding as of the effective time of the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  we acquired a cash flow positive company with million in senior debt due in may at an interest rate of until december when the interest rate increases to 
while it is our intent to satisfy this debt either through refinancing  obtaining a senior line of credit  or possible equity raise  we will incur substantial additional cash interest charges until we do so 
we may be unable to raise additional funds 
the following table represents our contractual cash obligations due over the next several years including a separate table for planvista commencing after the acquisition 
at the present time  none of our contractual cash obligations extend beyond except for the maturity of our million in convertible notes on december  assuming no prior conversion 
operating leases are shown net of any sublease agreements 
in thousands interest on convertible notes convertible notes notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases acquisition related costs other obligations subtotal proxymed interest on senior and other debt senior debt notes payable operating leases subtotal planvista grand total assumes no conversion of convertible notes 
we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand to fund our future operational capital requirements and expenditures  and a sufficient level of capital in order to fund specific research and development projects or to pursue smaller additional strategic acquisitions 
even with the positive cash flow expected to be generated from our operations  we anticipate that we will need to refinance the planvista debt  obtain a senior line of credit  or raise capital in order to satisfy this debt on or before maturity 
however  if we require additional funding in the future to satisfy any of our outstanding  future obligations  or further our strategic plans  there can be no assurance that any additional funding will be available to us  or if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of significantly diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our common stock 
we believe that if we are not successful in obtaining additional financing for further product development or strategic acquisitions  such inability may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our business plan and may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions but we believe that any variation in results would not have a material effect on our financial condition 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition transaction services fee revenue is recorded in the period the service is rendered 
certain transaction fee revenue may be subject to revenue sharing per agreements with resellers  vendors or gateway partners and are recorded as gross revenues 
revenue from sales of inventory and manufactured goods is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue from certain up front fees is amortized ratably over the expected life of the customer or contract 
revenue from hardware leases  network access and maintenance fees is recognized ratably over the applicable period 
goodwill we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
this adoption resulted in the reduction of approximately million of amortization relating to its existing goodwill each quarter  which would have otherwise been recorded through the first quarter of sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a fair value methodology versus an undiscounted cash flow method required under previous accounting rules 
in accordance with our adoption of sfas no 
 we completed our annual tests at december  and utilizing various valuation techniques including a market value analysis 
no impairment charges were recorded as a result of these tests 
capitalized software development and research and development costs incurred internally and fees paid to outside contractors and consultants during the application development stage of our internally used software products are capitalized 
costs of upgrades and major enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized 
costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades are expensed as incurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred as research and development expenses which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
application development stage costs generally include software configuration  coding  installation to hardware and testing 
once the project is completed  capitalized costs are amortized over their remaining estimated economic life 
our judgment is used in determining whether costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
we periodically review projected cash flows and other criteria in assessing the impairment of any internal use capitalized software and take impairment charges as needed 
equity transactions over the past three years  we have engaged in various equity transactions 
these transactions were first aimed at providing capital to continue to operate and grow our business and then became a critical step aimed at simplifying our capital structure 
these transactions are complex and require the application of various accounting rules and standards that have resulted in significant cash and non cash charges reflected primarily as deemed dividend charges included our net loss applicable to common shareholders 
additionally  the valuation of the planvista warrant was based on a series of assumptions that are used in a complex financial model 
this warrant s value of million was written off upon its expiration in december bad debt estimates we rely on estimates to determine the bad debt expense and the adequacy of the reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates are based on our historical experience and the industry in which we operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights  or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  disclosure requirements apply to any financial statements issued after january  currently we do not have variable interest entities  therefore we do not believe that the implementation of fin no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for certain provision that relate to sfas no
