item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary was a year of great achievement for first regional bancorp 
total assets rose by during the year  deposits rose  and loans rose by in this balance sheet growth led first regional to achieve record earnings in our net income represented a increase over the results of the prior year 
also contributing to our increased profitability were our regional offices and business units 
each of these profit centers increased its contribution to first regional s success in  and we anticipate further improvement in the future as these units continue to penetrate their respective markets 
during the year  we established new regional offices in hollywood and westlake village  enabling us to bring our proven business banking expertise to a broader base of business clients 
in order to keep pace with our strong asset growth  first regional bancorp further strengthened its capital base during early in the year  we obtained approximately million of equity capital through a private placement of common stock  and in october we generated additional capital through the private placement of million in convertible subordinated debentures 
in each case  the majority of the new capital was contributed to first regional bank to support its future growth 
while was a most successful year for first regional  we are optimistic that further improvement can be achieved in and beyond 
of course  unforeseen events such as an economic slowdown or further interest rate reductions by the federal reserve could impact future results  but nonetheless we believe that first regional s future is bright 
we further believe that our proven business model characterized by strong asset quality  capital strength  and prudent reserves is the most effective way to deal with the inevitable economic uncertainties and to maximize shareholder value over time

the company achieved continued profitability in  with significant increases in assets  deposits and loans 
the company continues to benefit from strategic decisions made previously  when the company initiated a program of prudent  managed growth  this program resulted in higher levels of earning assets and interest revenue in  and the company s profitability was also in part a reflection of the continued low levels of nonperforming loans  other real estate owned  and other nonearning assets 
average assets in were  compared to  in and  in as was the case in and  the company s asset growth in was funded by an increase in deposits  as well as by the retention of earnings for the year 
the company generated net income of  in compared to a profit of  in and a profit of  in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans 
management considers this accounting policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment as described in loan portfolio and provision for loan losses 
we generally cease to accrue interest on any loan with respect to which the loan s contractual payments are more than days delinquent  as well as loans classified substandard for which interest payment reserves were established from loan funds rather than borrower funds 
in addition  interest is not recognized on any loan for which management has determined that collection of our investment in the loan is not reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current  the loan is paying in accordance with its payment terms and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
properties acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure  are transferred to the other real estate owned portfolio and carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated costs to sell the property 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less costs to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value includes revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property less construction and renovation costs 
net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest income earned on interest earning assets over interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
interest income or expense are determined by the average volume of interest bearing assets or liabilities  and the average rate of interest earned or paid on those assets or liabilities 
as was the case during  in the company s continued growth efforts resulted in an increase in interest earning assets  including loans 
the bank s core loan portfolio increased significantly during the asset growth reflects a corresponding increase in total deposits resulting from an increase in full service bank branches during and an increase in personnel in and while the deposit growth was centered in noninterest bearing deposits  time deposits and money market deposits  there was also growth in savings deposits 
average money market and time deposits increased in as compared to the prior year 
deposit levels increased and interest rates decreased in from the  and the combination of higher deposit levels and lower interest rates led to a slight increase in interest expense in average time deposits decreased slightly in as compared to the prior year 
deposit levels increased and interest rates decreased in from the  and the combination of higher deposit levels and lower interest rates led to a significant decrease in interest expense in interest rates and interest differential the following table sets forth the average balances outstanding for major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the average interest rates earned and paid thereon for year ended december  average balance interest income expense average yield rate average balance interest income expense average yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans     investment securities   federal funds sold   time deposits with other financial institutions  total interest earning assets    for year ended december  average balance income expense yield rate average balance income expense yield rate dollars in thousands interest bearing liabilities savings deposits   money market accounts     time deposits     other borrowings  subordinated debentures   total interest bearing liabilities    this figure reflects total loans  including non accrual loans  and is not net of the allowance for losses  which had an average balance of  in and  in includes loan fees of  in and  in the following table shows the net interest earnings and the net yield on average interest earning assets for year ended december  dollars in thousands total interest income   total interest expense   net interest earnings   average interest earning assets   average interest bearing liabilities   net yield on average interest earning assets includes loan fees of  in and  in the following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense

includes loan fees of  in because customer deposits are the company s principal funding source outside of its capital  management has attempted to match rates and maturities of its deposits with its investment and loan portfolios as part of its liquidity and asset and liability management policies 
the objective of these policies is to manage the company s interest rate sensitivity and limit the fluctuations of net interest income resulting from interest rate changes 
the table which follows in section a indicates the repricing or maturity characteristics of the major categories of the bank s assets and liabilities as of december   and thus the relative sensitivity of the bank s net interest income to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
other operating income other operating income increased for to  versus  in and  for the year trust administration services corp 
tasc  the banks s wholly owned subsidiary that provides administrative services to self directed retirement plans  had revenue that totaled  during and  during and  during the bank s merchant services operation  which provides credit card deposit and clearing services to retailers and other credit card accepting businesses  had revenue that totaled  in   in and  in the bank s trust services department  which provides trust services for living trusts  investment agency accounts  ira rollovers  and all forms of court related matters commenced operations in and had revenue that totaled  in   in and  in loan portfolio and provision for loan losses the loan portfolio consisted of the following at december  and dollars in thousands commercial loans   real estate construction loans   real estate loans   government guaranteed loans   other loans   total loans   less allowances for loan losses deferred loan fees   net loans   the allowance for loan losses is intended to reflect the known and unknown risks which are inherent in a loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is continually evaluated in light of many factors  including loan loss experience and current economic conditions 
the company s emphasis on maintaining high asset quality continued in  and as a result  non performing assets loans past due ninety days or more excluding government guaranteed loans  loans on nonaccrual status  and other real estate owned totaled  less than of total loans at the end of although this is an increase from  on december  and  on december   management believes the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate in relation to both existing and potential risks in the loan portfolio 
the bank has historically evaluated the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses on an overall basis rather than by specific categories of loans 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers such factors as historical loan loss experience  known problem loans  evaluations made by bank regulatory authorities  assessment of economic conditions and other appropriate data to identify the risks in the loan portfolio 
the first major element includes a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio in two phases 
the first phase is conducted in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
individual loans are reviewed to identify loans for impairment 
a loan is impaired when principal and interest are deemed uncollectable in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan 
impairment is measured as either the expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the loan s collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  or an observable market price of the loan if one exists 
upon measuring the impairment  the bank will insure an appropriate level of allowance is present or established 
central to the first phase and the bank s credit risk management is its loan risk rating system 
the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating  which is based primarily on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition  which would impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
credits undergo a quarterly loan review and a periodic review by the regulators 
risk ratings are adjusted as necessary 
based on the risk rating system specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicates the probability that a loss has been incurred 
management performs a detailed analysis of these loans  including  but not limited to  cash flows  appraisals of the collateral  conditions of the marketplace for liquidating the collateral and assessment of the guarantors 
management then determines the inherent loss potential and allocates a portion of the allowance for losses as a specific allowance for each of these credits 
the second phase is conducted by evaluating or segmenting the remainder of the loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans with similar characteristics in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in this second phase  groups or pools of homogeneous loans are reviewed to determine a portfolio allowance 
additionally groups of non homogeneous loans  such as construction loans  are also reviewed to determine a portfolio allowance 
the risk assessment process in this case emphasizes trends in the different portfolios for delinquency  loss  and other behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios 
the second major element in the bank s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of management s considerations of all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect a loan s collectibility 
this includes management s estimates of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties  the volatility of the market value of collateral  and other relevant factors 
the relationship of the two major elements of the allowance to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions which are charged to operating expense and is reduced by loan chargeoffs 
any subsequent recoveries of charged off loans are added back into the allowance 
based on its ongoing analysis of the risks presented by its loan portfolio  in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses  a significant increase from the prior year due to the substantial increase in the loan portfolio   in loans were charged off  and no loans previously charged off were recovered 
in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses  no loans were charged off  and no loans previously charged off were recovered 
by way of comparison  in provisions of  were made to the reserve for loan losses   in loans were charged off  and  in loans previously charged off were recovered 
these transactions brought the balance of the allowance for loan losses at the end of to  or of total loans  compared to to  or of total loans  and compared to  or of total loans at december  in  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
in  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
in contrast  during  the company identified loans having an aggregate average balance of  which it concluded were impaired under sfas no 
the company s policy is generally to discontinue the accrual of interest income on impaired loans  and to recognize income on such loans only after the loan principal has been repaid in full  and to establish a general loss reserve for each of the loans which at december  totaled  for the loans as a group 
operating expenses total operating expenses rose in  to  from  in and  in while the total expense figures increased primarily due to increases in overall bank growth  most components continue to be moderated by the effects of an ongoing program of expense control 
salaries and related benefits expense increased again in  rising to  from a total of  and from  in the increase in this expense category principally reflects the increases in staffing which took place due to the additions of the trust department as well as staffing in the new regional offices as part of the company s growth initiative 
occupancy expense rose in  to  from  in and a total of  the increases reflect the rent paid on the various facilities which house the bank s expansion of regional offices 
other expenses rose again in as they did in and other expenses totaled  in compared to  in  which was increased from  in other expenses in include professional services of  an increase from the prior year when professional services were  for  an increase after totaling  in data processing fees increased in to  compared to  in and  in equipment expense increased to  during from  during and  for customer courier service expense increased to  during from  during and  for directors fees increased due to increased corporate regulations and were  in   in  and  in most of the remaining categories of other expense generally remained stable  which rose to  in from  in and  in principally due to higher costs of services provided to customers 
taxes the combined effects of the activity described above resulted in income before taxes of  in  up from  in  and  in in  the company recorded tax provisions of  the company recorded tax provisions of  and  during and  respectively 
as a result  the company generated net income of  in  compared to  in  and versus net income of  in contractual obligations the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in notes    and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands deposits without a stated maturity  certificates of deposits    federal home loan bank advances   subordinated debentures     note payable operating leases      excludes interest

total liquid assets cash and due from banks  investment securities  and federal funds sold totaled  and  or and of total deposits at december  and  respectively 
in addition  at december   some million of the banks total loans consisted of government guaranteed loans which represent a significant source of liquidity due to the active secondary markets which exist for these assets

total shareholders equity was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the company s capital ratios for those dates in comparison with regulatory capital requirements were as follows leverage ratio tier i capital to assets first regional bancorp regulatory requirement the regulatory requirement listed represents the level of capital required for adequately capitalized status 
in addition  bank regulators have risk adjusted capital guidelines which assign risk weighting to assets and off balance sheet items and place increased emphasis on common equity 
the company s risk adjusted capital ratios for the dates listed in comparison with the risk adjusted capital requirements were as follows tier i capital to assets first regional bancorp regulatory requirement total capital to assets first regional bancorp regulatory requirement the company meets all applicable capital standards at december  and believes that it will continue to meet all applicable capital standards 
during  the company established an employee stock ownership plan consisting of  shares of first regional common stock was acquired in market transactions or directly from first regional bancorp at an average price of per share

since the yields on these assets quickly adjust to reflect changes in the overall level of interest rates  there are no significant unrealized gains or losses with respect to the company s assets  nor is there much likelihood of large realized or unrealized gains or losses developing in the future 
the bank s investment portfolio continues to be composed of high quality  low risk securities  principally us treasury and agency securities 
no gains or losses were recorded on security sales during  or as of december  the bank s investment portfolio contained no gross unrealized losses or gains 
as of december  the bank s investment portfolio contained no gross unrealized losses and gross unrealized gains of  for net unrealized gains of  because the company s holdings of securities are intended to serve as a source of liquidity should conditions warrant  the securities have been classified by the company as available for sale  and thus unrealized gains and losses have no effect on the company s income statement
