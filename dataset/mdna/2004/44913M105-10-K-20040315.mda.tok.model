table of contents during the third quarter of  we committed to a profit improvement plan which included the closure of offices around the world in favor of a more cost effective distributor sales model and the termination of our direct manufacturing operations in brazil 
restructuring charges in cost of sales include million related to the write down of inventories and other related costs 
restructuring charges of million  which are separately stated  include million related to the write down of a building and other fixed assets to their estimated fair value and million related to termination costs and other charges 
see note to the financial statements 
during the third quarter of  we wrote off our remaining million investment in cirilium corporation  a joint corporate venture that we had formed in late with inter tel incorporated 
through september   we had accounted for our investment in cirilium on the equity method and had reported million in losses in connection with this investment 
this write off and the reporting of these losses  in the total amount of million  contributed to our net loss for the year ended december  in connection with the early retirement of two term loans  we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the loss resulted from the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loan discount associated with our term loans 
during  we increased the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by million  of which million contributed to our loss before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and million was recorded in discontinued operations related to golden eagle for the period ending december  during the third quarter of  the company identified certain unprofitable businesses and  effective with the decision to hold these operating units for sale  recorded a loss of million to write down the assets to their estimated fair value 
for comparative purposes  all prior operating results of these unprofitable businesses have been reclassified to reflect the results of operations in discontinued operations 
during  the company completed the disposition of all remaining operating units identified and initially held for sale in september in connection with the disposition of these operating units  the company recorded a loss on sale of million during comprised of a million cash infusion made by the company in accordance with the terms of the sale  non cash inventory and fixed asset write downs of million  severance costs of million  the write off of million in uncollectible accounts receivable  and facility lease and other exit costs of million 
consistent with the company s strategy of disposing of operating units not aligned with its core business  the company sold its direct finance lease subsidiary  golden eagle  effective october   for million gross cash proceeds  and recorded a million gain net of severance and other exit costs 
as a result of the disposition  the net operating results of golden eagle have been reported within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the transition provisions of sfas  we evaluated our reporting units for impairment of goodwill and recorded a million write off primarily attributable to goodwill associated with the acquisition of golden eagle leasing 
per share data is diluted per share  except for the years ended december    and  as the effect of common stock equivalents in those years was anti dilutive 
subsequent to the release of its operating results for the third quarter ended september   and prior to the filing of its form q for the period  the company identified million of prepaid taxes at a foreign subsidiary not expected to be recoverable 
upon review of the transactions that gave rise to the amounts  the company determined that these prepaid amounts related to transactions which had occurred in and  and were not correctly interpreted by the personnel responsible for financial reporting and  as a result  were not correctly recorded in light of information that was available at that time 
the company has determined that this is an accounting error and should be corrected by restating the amounts previously reflected in the and financial statements 
accordingly  the decem 
table of contents ber  balance sheet has been restated to reduce prepaid expenses and other current assets and increase accumulated deficit by million  respectively 
the company reflected the results of this restatement in the and information presented 
the correction resulted in the reduction of six months ended december  sales and net income by million  respectively  and reduced earnings per share by 
the year ended sales were reduced by million  the net loss increased by million  and net loss per share increased by see note

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in exhibit of this annual report on form k entitled cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and risk factors  in the discussion below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  long term contracts  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  foreign currency  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our sales relate to product shipments  which are recognized upon shipment of product pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
and no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab and 
service revenues and revenues from long term contracts are each less than of our revenues 
although we meet the requirements of sab and upon shipment of product and the recording of revenue  we continually evaluate our accounts receivable for any bad debts or product returns and make estimates for any bad debt allowances or product return reserves as the specific situations dictate 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we compute such allowance based upon a specific customer account review of our larger customers and balances in excess of days old 
our assessment of our customers ability to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  investigation into our customers financial status  as well as consideration of our customers payment history with us 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if we determine  based on our assessment  that it is more likely than not that our customers will be unable to pay  we will charge off the accounts receivable 

table of contents we record reductions to revenue based on estimates of product returns 
the estimate of product returns is based on historical return trends as well as our assessment of individual customer orders and shipments 
such returns can result from customer nonpayment  in which we request that our product be returned  or a decision on the part of the customer to return the product 
direct financing leases direct financing lease activity was reported in our direct financing lease subsidiary  golden eagle 
we sold golden eagle in the fourth quarter of  recognizing a gain on sale of approximately million 
the gain and operating results of golden eagle for all prior periods presented have been recorded and reclassified  respectively  into discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
the net investment in direct financing leases reported in the consolidated balance sheets at december  relates solely to golden eagle 
in addition to the lease contract receivables and initial direct costs  the balance of net investment in direct financing leases contains an allowance for credit losses and an amount representing an estimate of the unguaranteed residual value of the equipment under finance lease 
the balance of net investment in financing leases was subsequently realized at the time of sale  october  sales type leases certain sales of product are sold under a capital lease arrangement  recorded as a sales type lease in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases  as amended 
sales type lease revenues consist of the initial sale of the product shipped and the interest and maintenance elements of the lease payments as they are earned 
we maintain an allowance for estimated uncollectible sales type lease receivables at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our sales type lease portfolio 
our allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the sales type lease customer base 
if loss rates increase or credit conditions at our customers deteriorate  we may need to increase our allowance for uncollectible sales type leases 
in addition  as part of the initial recording of our sales type leases  we estimate the unguaranteed residual value of the equipment under sales type lease 
this is the estimated fair value of the equipment that will be returned to or purchased from us at the end of the initial lease period 
our estimate of the residual value is based on industry standards and our actual experience 
if market conditions change negatively  it could have an adverse impact on the estimated residual value amount 
long term contract revenue we are involved in one long term contract with the brazil health ministry requiring substantial performance of customized software and hardware 
we recognize revenues and an estimated gross profit upon the attainment of scheduled performance milestones under the percentage of completion method 
we follow this method since the contract contains well defined performance milestones and we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of our contract 
our gross profit estimates rely on our continuous estimates of total contract costs compared to contract revenue and any claims in excess of contract revenue where it is both probable the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of the excess claim can be reliably estimated 
previously recognized gross profits and the valuation of deferred contract costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion and any claims for revenues in excess of the original contract are settled 
revisions in profit estimates and the valuation of deferred contract costs are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
inventory we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions generally over a twelve month period on an item by item basis 
if actual market 
table of contents conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes during  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our then remaining unreserved deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of a continued economic downturn on our estimated us sourced future income 
as a result  there are no remaining unreserved balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheets as of december  and the valuation allowance is subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  operating profits  in the tax jurisdictions giving rise to the deferred tax assets  become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas accounting for income tax 
the recoverability criteria in sfas requires our judgment of whether it is more likely than not  based on an evaluation of positive and negative evidence  that a valuation allowance is not needed 
if in the future  positive evidence of sufficient quality and quantity overcomes the negative evidence  we would reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance resulting in a decrease to our income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and need for valuation allowances quarterly 
the company does business in a number of different countries 
tax authorities may scrutinize the various tax structures employed by the company in these countries 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves  including our valuation reserve for deferred tax assets  to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense or reduction to our related valuation reserve would result 
in addition  any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit could affect the individual items that comprise the company s fully reserved deferred tax asset balance 
contingencies and litigation on an ongoing basis management monitors the need to provide an estimated loss contingency arising from normal operations or litigation matters 
there are no such contingencies provided for at december  we rely on our in house counsel and outside counsel to advise us about ongoing litigation matters 
based upon information available at this time  we believe our current litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and our financial condition 
overview of financial results the following overview will highlight certain key events and factors impacting our financial performance over the past three years year the year was highlighted by our focus on the performance deficiencies at golden eagle and our debt and equity activity 
as discussed previously  golden eagle was sold in the fourth quarter of  and consequently the operating results of golden eagle have been reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented 
one of our main objectives was to improve the financial performance of golden eagle 
as a result of our continued focus on golden eagle  we recorded an incremental charge of million in the first quarter of to strengthen credit reserves for certain segments of golden eagles direct finance lease receivables that had been specifically impacted by certain events of that economic period 
this charge was recorded in costs of revenue and is included in the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  
table of contents our debt and equity activity in began with a series of interim measures to raise cash in anticipation of refinancing our primary credit facility 
these interim measures included the issuance of common stock  and certain bridge borrowings that were ultimately converted to common stock through conversion rights attached to the borrowings  or from the repayment of the bridge borrowings with our common stock 
such financing and equity measures amounted to million 
we completed a refinancing of our principal credit facility in august with a new million senior secured credit facility including a line of credit and two term loans 
although this new facility provided us with increased liquidity  it was a relatively expensive source of capital 
consequently  and as more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we paid off a significant portion of these facilities with proceeds from a private equity offering completed in march the bridge borrowings and new credit facility included the issuance of stock warrants  which further contributed to our higher interest costs in year the year was highlighted by the completion of a private placement of our common stock  significant charges related to the carrying value of goodwill and deferred tax assets  the implementation of a profit improvement plan and a significant improvement in income from continuing operations 
in the first quarter of  we completed the issuance and sale of common stock in a private equity offering 
net proceeds from the offering of million were used principally to pay off high cost debt 
as a result of the early extinguishment of debt  we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt relating to for the write off of debt issuance costs in the amount of million in the first quarter of on january   we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of sfas resulted in the complete write off of goodwill balances  existing at january   in the amount of million in the second quarter 
in accordance with sfas  this write off was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
during the third quarter of  we increased our valuation allowance on our then remaining deferred tax assets by million 
the increase in the valuation allowance increased our tax expense attributable to both continuing operations and discontinued operations by million 
there were no remaining balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheet as of december  as discussed further in management s discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we undertook a profit improvement plan in  which resulted in restructuring certain operations and holding other operations for sale as discontinued operations 
the restructuring costs element of the plan were reported as expenses within income from continuing operations  while the losses from the discontinued operations are reported separately as part of our net loss 
the restructuring charges totaling million included write downs to assets  including inventories and fixed assets  as well as accruals for severance and other operating expenses 
losses from discontinued operations totaling million included million in initial write downs of assets to fair value  as well as the operating results of the discontinued operations during year the year was highlighted by the completion of our profit improvement and restructuring plan initiated in september with a resulting improvement in operating and net income  strengthening of our balance sheet  and the sale of golden eagle 
completing our restructuring plan during allowed us to focus on our core terminal and network systems business  which resulted in improved gross margins while maintaining operating expenses at levels appropriate to support the core business activities 
gross margins improved principally from continuing improvements in reducing costs in our core set of product offerings through reductions in material costs as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies 
operating expenses were essentially unchanged from reflecting a leveling off of spending to match our business model as contemplated under our profit improvement and restructuring plan initiated in september 
table of contents in addition to improving our profits  we were able to strengthen our balance sheet as of december  compared to december  improvements in our balance sheet are reflected in increased cash and short term investment balances  elimination of current debt and increased working capital and stockholders equity 
we continue to maintain a million revolving line of credit  albeit there were no borrowings during these achievements are principally a result of our profit improvements  improvements in our accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turnover  and the sale of golden eagle 
while we continued to experience improvements in the financial performance of golden eagle  we decided a direct finance leasing operation was outside our core business and did not have a long term role in our strategic plan 
consequently  we sold golden eagle in the fourth quarter of resulting in a gain of million  with gross proceeds received of million 
the following should be read in light of the matters highlighted in the overview 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth the operating results expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of future results 
year ended december  net revenue costs of revenue gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from continuing operations interest and other expense  net of interest and other income loss on early extinguishment of debt foreign currency loss income loss before taxes  discontinued operations  and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision benefit for income taxes income loss before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss 
table of contents net revenue by geographic region is presented in the following table as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues by region united states latin america  including mexico asia pacific europe totals the results of continuing operations discussed herein exclude the operations of the operating units being reported as discontinued operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior years results of continuing operations have been restated to reflect the discontinued operations on a consistent basis with comparison of years ended december  and net revenue for the year ended december  decreased million or to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
net revenues for include the attainment of a performance milestone under our brazilian health ministry contract resulting in revenue of million during the first quarter of  versus million in revenue recognized under the same contract in performance milestones under this contract were substantially less than the milestones achieved in  as we have entered the maintenance phase of this contract 
in addition  during the company transacted the sale of terminals that the company had previously leased to a third party to derive rental income under an operating lease 
the sale of these terminals was accounted for under a sales type lease arrangement and contributed million in revenues 
exclusive of the revenues for the brazil health ministry contract in both years and the revenues under the sales type lease arrangement in  net revenues declined during the year ended december  by million compared to this decline is due principally to a decline in network systems revenues associated with one of its largest contracts 
revenues under this contract in were essentially limited to software maintenance  while included both hardware deliveries and software maintenance 
there can be no assurance that network systems will be able to replace this contract in the future with one of equal size or duration 
additionally  revenues were impacted by a soft global economy and uncertainties in the first half of associated with the conflict in iraq 
the remaining milestones under the brazilian health ministry contract are expected to be completed during  as we are in the final maintenance phase of this contract 
however  as of december   we have identified and made a claim for approximately million of revenue in excess of the agreed contract 
we believe it is probable our claim will result in additional revenue and have reasonably estimated such amount in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
while the revenue related to these claims has not been recorded under our percentage of completion milestone approach  contract costs to be recovered by these revenue claims amounting to approximately million have been deferred within other long term assets at december  and and treated as normal costs of contract performance 
if our revenue claim is denied or results in revenue less than our associated costs  our operating results would be significantly impacted 
net revenue from services activities  principally derived from pos support services  and from our long term contract with the brazilian health ministry  each comprised less than of total net revenue in each of the years ended december  and our cost of revenue includes the cost of raw materials  manufacturing labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  as well as loan loss provisions with respect to sales type leases 
the costs of revenue for the year ended december  decreased million or to million from million for 
table of contents the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to in the same period in the prior year 
both the change in cost of revenue and the gross margin were affected by various events in both and as discussed previously  included million in revenue from the brazilian health ministry contract versus million recognized in this contract carries a fully absorbed operating margin currently estimated at and thus can impact the overall margin percentage when revenues are inconsistent between periods 
further  gross margin benefited from the sale of fully depreciated terminals the company had previously leased to a third party  contributing million to the company s gross margin in additionally  cost of revenues for includes the effects of restructuring charges in the amount of million relative to our restructuring activity discussed below 
further  in connection with the company s transition of its manufacturing operations in brazil to a contract manufacturer  certain sales orders in the brazilian market were supplied from our factory in china for which importation and tax costs had the effect of decreasing the margin by approximately million in the company also wrote down inventory and incurred other incremental charges relative to assessments of net realizable value amounting to million during the third quarter of exclusive of the brazilian health ministry revenues and related cost of revenues  the sale of fully depreciated terminals in and the restructuring and other charges incurred during  as noted above  the gross margin for the year ended december  and would be and  respectively 
the increase in is a result of our continued manufacturing and product cost reductions and improved pricing in certain service operations 
research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased million or to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
the spending in research and development was flat year over year due to our continued focus on a cost efficient approach to research and development 
present development activities are primarily focusing on reducing the component costs of existing product and to select new product introductions having a commercially feasible market demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  facilities operations and other corporate overhead 
these expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the slight increase principally represents certain additions to our direct sales activities as we identify new markets and promote new product offerings 
the restructuring activity associated with is discussed further in the comparison of to during  there were no new restructuring charges contemplated nor any additional restructuring charges incurred related to the restructuring plan initiated in the company incurred million in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to million in interest expense for consists primarily of interest expense on long term borrowings and amortization of deferred financing charges 
interest expense for includes essentially the same elements as plus additional interest incurred on two term loans with principal balances totaling million and a million note from a former director and former stockholder outstanding during the first quarter of the term loans and note were paid off in march with proceeds we received from a private placement of common stock 
foreign currency losses totaling million for the year ended december  were largely attributable to forward contract hedge premiums and local transaction losses in our swedish subsidiary 
foreign currency losses for the year ended december  of million related to the devaluation of the brazilian real and argentinean peso partially offset by gains in the british pound 
the reduced loss is a result of a hedging program the company has undertaken to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real  british pound  chilean peso and australian dollar 
gains and losses on these contracts principally consisted of our mark to market adjustments  recorded in net earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 

table of contents income tax expense before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for federal  state and foreign taxes was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the income tax provision for is comprised of income taxes associated with the company s profitable foreign locations 
as discussed in the company s annual report on form k  the company recorded full valuation reserves against the company s unreserved deferred tax asset balance existing at september  consistent with the facts and circumstances leading to our conclusion to provide a full valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets in  we have provided a further valuation allowance against any net increases in deferred tax assets which in consisted principally of us net operating losses generated during accordingly  the valuation allowances render the effective tax rates for and not meaningful 
these valuation allowances are subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas the valuation allowances are also subject to reduction to the extent the related net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets ultimately become unusable through expiration or additional assessments that could be made by various taxing jurisdictions 
there was no income tax expense recorded in discontinued operations for  as the income tax was offset by the reversal of valuation allowances previously placed against deferred tax assets allocated to discontinued operations during income tax expense recorded in discontinued operations for was million  and was primarily attributable to valuation allowances placed against golden eagle s deferred tax assets 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenue for the year ended december  increased million or to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
net revenues for include the effects of a million reserve for a sales return 
exclusive of the sales return  net revenues would have been further  net revenues include the attainment of a performance milestone under our brazilian health ministry contract resulting in revenue of million during the first quarter of  versus million in revenue recognized under the same contract in exclusive of the revenues for the brazilian health ministry contract in both years and the sales return in  net revenues declined during the year ended december  by million compared to this decline is due principally to a decline in revenues in network systems revenues which was principally due to the fulfillment of substantial orders under one of its largest contracts throughout deliveries under such contract declined during as the contract neared completion 
there can be no assurance that network systems will be able to replace this contract in the future with one of equal size or duration 
net revenues from services activities  principally derived from pos support services  and from our long term contract with the brazilian health ministry  each comprised less than of total net revenue in each of the years ended december  and our cost of revenue includes the cost of raw materials  manufacturing labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  as well as loan loss provisions with respect to sales type leases 
the costs of revenue for the year ended december  increased million or to million from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to in the same period in the prior year 
both the change in cost of revenue and the gross margin were affected by various events in both and as discussed previously  included million in revenue from the brazilian health ministry contract versus million recognized in this contract carries a fully absorbed operating margin currently estimated at and thus can impact the overall margin percentage when revenues are inconsistent between periods 
additionally  cost of revenues for includes the effects of restructuring charges in the amount of million relative to our restructuring activity discussed below 
further  in connection with the company s transition of its manufacturing operations in brazil to a contract manufacturer  certain sales orders in the brazilian market were supplied from our factory in china for which importation and tax costs had the 
table of contents effect of decreasing the margin by approximately million in the company also wrote down inventory and incurred other incremental charges relative to assessments of net realizable value amounting to million during the third quarter of exclusive of the brazilian health ministry revenues and related cost of revenues and the restructuring and other charges incurred during  as noted above  the gross margin for the year ended december  and would be and  respectively 
the increase in is a result of our continued manufacturing and product cost reductions and improved pricing in certain service operations 
research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased million or to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
the decreases over prior year are directly attributable to a more focused and cost efficient approach to research and development 
since substantially all development activities related to the introduction of the ice product family and the epic initiative are complete  the overall level of research and development activities has been reduced 
present development activities are primarily focused on reducing the component costs of existing product and to select new product introductions having a commercially feasible market demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  facilities operations and other corporate overhead 
these expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in this decrease reflects significant cost containment measures put into place during the third quarter of and carrying forward for all of  along with restructuring related savings identified in the third quarter and realized  in part  during the fourth quarter of the cost containment measures and restructuring activities involve both a reduction in staffing as well as the curtailment of discretionary expenses 
in september  the company committed to a plan to improve profits in its pos and network systems segment 
the plan entailed downsizing and outsourcing certain operations and streamlining product offerings  changing to a distributor sales model versus a direct sales model in certain international locations  prioritizing and rationalizing research and development expenditures and disposing of certain unprofitable operations 
the profit improvement plan encompassed both restructuring activities to be accounted and reported under sfas  as well as discontinued operations to be accounted and reported under sfas see note to the financial statements 
the restructuring charges encompassed write downs of fixed assets and inventory  one time termination benefits and other miscellaneous accruals incurred in connection with the company s profit improvement plan 
the following table sets forth the expected costs to be incurred with the activity  the amount incurred during the period and the ending liability as of december  in thousands expected incurred accrued restructuring charges in cost of sales write down of inventories and related costs total restructuring charges in cost of sales restructuring charges write down of building to fair value write down of fixed assets to fair value write down of other assets to fair value one time termination benefits miscellaneous operating accruals total restructuring charges there were no restructuring charges incurred in 
table of contents income from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to a loss from continuing operations of million for the same period in the prior year 
the improvement in operating results is principally from the aforementioned improvement in gross margins coupled with the cost containment measures impacting both research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company incurred million in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to million for in the prior year 
interest expense for consists primarily of interest expense on long term borrowings and amortization of deferred financing charges 
interest expense for includes essentially the same elements as and also includes amortization of million in loan discounts from warrants issued and amortization of million relating to a beneficial notes payable conversion feature  both related to our refinancing activity during in addition to these amortization charges  the reduction in interest expense in compared to is related to the repayment of two term loans totaling million and a million note from a director and principal stockholder during the first quarter of the repayment was facilitated by proceeds we received from a private placement of common stock in the first quarter of relative to the decrease in interest expense  our total long term debt decreased from million at december  to million at december  other income expense in the amount of million for the year ended december  consisted principally of losses on fixed asset sales and net credits relating to corporate overhead charges allocated to discontinued operations 
income and expense in the amount of million for the year ended december  consisted primarily of charges associated with requirements under our debt forbearance agreements and other default related costs of million and net credits relating to corporate overhead charges to discontinued operations 
during  the company was not in default with its lenders and accordingly did not incur similar default related charges 
the corporate overhead charges to discontinued operations were ceased at the time the discontinued operations were declared held for sale in september foreign currency losses totaling million for the year ended december  were largely attributable to the devaluation of the brazilian real and argentinean peso partially offset by gains in the british pound 
foreign currency losses for the year ended december  of million related to general currency declines in europe and south america 
there was no significant devaluation of currencies impacting beginning in june of  the company resumed its foreign currency risk management strategy  which had been suspended starting in due to financial restrictions 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real and british pound 
gains and losses on these contracts principally consisted of our mark to market adjustments  recorded in net earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our then remaining unreserved deferred tax asset balance of approximately million 
we further increased our valuation allowance in for net increases in deferred tax assets that occurred principally by charges to expense that are not currently deductible or recoverable 
the increase in the valuation allowance was based on the weight of all available evidence  principally influenced by the continued us derived losses in the third quarter of coupled with a continuing extension of the us recession as well as cumulative us derived losses in recent years 
the us derived losses in the third quarter of and cumulatively over recent years together with an uncertain economic outlook for the us  were deemed to be significant negative evidence 
as a result  the company determined it did not meet the more likely than not recoverability criteria in sfas no 
 accounting for income tax  requiring positive evidence of sufficient quality and quantity to overcome the negative evidence in order to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed 
the valuation allowance is subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas there were no remaining unreserved balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheet at december  in addition to deferred tax expenses  which principally relate to our valuation allowance increases  the income tax provision for the year ended december  was comprised of income tax expenses from 
table of contents foreign locations with taxable income and a current tax benefit for certain us losses that can be carried back for refunds 
as a result of this combination of occurrences  the effective tax rate for the company in is not meaningful 
the company s effective rate of income tax benefit on continuing operations was for the year ended december  the income tax benefit rate in differed from the us statutory rate principally due to foreign taxes attributable to profitable foreign operations that are less than the us statutory rate  research and experimentation credits  the non recognition of tax benefit on foreign currency translation losses and valuation reserves 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from borrowings under a line of credit 
the company has also used borrowings under notes payable to fund working capital requirements and reduce its bank debt 
cash provided by continuing operations increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flow between and is principally due to the company s continued focus on maintaining its decreased working capital requirements as well as the receipt of a million income tax refund related to a us net operating loss carry back claim filed during the first quarter the decrease in working capital requirements principally relates to net changes in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable during  which more favorably impacted operating cash compared to net changes in those same working capital items during the change in inventory and its favorable impact on operating cash flow reflects a decline in inventory levels due to manufacturing efficiencies and maintaining inventory levels to support our core products 
accounts receivable and accounts payable changes during the twelve month period ending december  compared to reflect normal variations in the customer collection and vendor payment process 
offsetting those events and factors increasing operating cash flows  the company continues to experience growth in its sales type lease portfolio requiring the use of operating cash flow 
the company is currently evaluating financing or outside funding source alternatives to augment the use of operating cash flows to fund the sales type lease activity 
cash provided by investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to cash used in investing activities of million in the same period a year ago 
this increase is principally related to million in cash proceeds received from the sale of the company s direct finance leasing business and other discontinued operations net of million in excess cash reinvested in marketable securities during the our current marketable securities primarily consist of various government agency debt securities and preferred equity securities 
we classify these short term investments as available for sale 
as our cash flow from operations continues to grow  we may increase these investment balances 
capital expenditures declined million from million in to million in capital expenditures were higher in due to leasehold improvements incurred as a result of the relocation of the company s brazilian manufacturing facility 
during  capital expenditures were principally for upgrades to computer software and equipment purchases 
we currently intend to spend approximately to million during the next twelve months in capital expenditures principally to continue to upgrade computer software and hardware 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in the same period a year ago 
this million decrease is primarily attributable to the company s on going efforts to reduce long term debt 
during  the company was able to significantly reduce its long term debt to million from million at december   principally as a result of the sale of golden eagle 
at december   working capital and cash were and million  respectively  compared to and million at december   respectively 
on march   the company completed the issuance and sale of  shares of its common stock  par value per share the shares  at a price of per share 
the shares were sold in a 
table of contents private offering transaction exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended 
the shares were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission effective may  the net proceeds of the private offering amounted to million and were used to repay two term loans with principal balances of million and million  respectively  under the company s credit facility  million in outstanding loans from a director and principal stockholder and to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the company s million revolving credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the early retirement of the term loans  the company recorded an extraordinary loss on retirement of debt of million during the first quarter of in accordance with sfas  rescission of fasb statements no  and  amendment of fasb statement no  and technical corrections  the company has reclassified its million extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt for the twelve months ended december  to pre tax income see note 
further  in connection with the private offering  the company entered into an agreement with its principal lenders relating to its revolving credit facility which waived any default or event of default with respect to the delivery of certain collateral documents that the company was obligated to deliver under the facility and permitted the company to repay the term loans 
the effective date of the amendment was march  effective december   the senior secured credit facility was amended and restated to a fully cash secured arrangement in an effort to reduce costs and to further match the company s current liquidity needs 
under the terms of the amended and restated agreement  the company is required to maintain a million unrestricted cash balance and is limited on the amount of certain additional debt the company can incur 
any borrowings under the revolving line of credit must be fully secured by an equal amount of cash 
all other financial covenants and most of the restrictions under the former agreement were removed 
the available credit on the revolving line of credit  which was previously reduced to million during march  was further reduced to million under the amended and restated senior secured credit facility 
the interest rate was reduced from the greater of or prime plus  to the greater of or prime plus 
the amended and restated senior secured credit facility expires july  the company had no advances on the revolving line of credit during and no outstanding balance under the senior secured credit facility at december  the company continues to accelerate cash generation through aggressively pursuing collection of trade receivables  reducing inventories and controlling expenses 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with our current cash reserves  will be sufficient to fund our projected liquidity and capital resource requirements through if operating results are unfavorable  we may need to use additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
stock repurchase in june  the board of directors authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
in addition  during august  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million in common stock to maximize shareholder value 
during  the company purchased  shares of its common stock for million 
the repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock and result in a reduction in stockholder s equity 
the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate considerations

the company estimates that approximately or less of the outstanding purchase obligations at december  are noncancellable due to the customized nature of the order 
backlog as of december   our backlog was million  compared to million at december  the decrease in backlog is primarily related to the fulfillment of orders for major customers within the united states that are subject to a customer approved delivery schedule 
the company includes in its backlog all revenue specified in signed contracts and purchase orders to the extent that the company contemplates recognition of the related revenue within one year 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in backlog will actually generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the one year period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our cash equivalent investments are primarily in money market accounts and certificates of deposit and are reflected as cash equivalents because all maturities are within days 
our interest rate risk with respect to existing investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned which approximate current interest rates 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of december   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material given that the our investments typically have interest rate reset features that regularly adjust to current market rates 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations and markets 
nevertheless  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a substantial portion of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do at times enter into these transactions in other currencies  such as the hong kong dollar  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound and other asian and european currencies 
beginning in june  the company resumed its foreign currency risk management strategy  which had been suspended starting the fourth quarter of due to credit limitations imposed by the company s banks 
as a policy  the company hedges the translation of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries in an attempt to neutralize the effect of translation gains or losses in the statement of operations 
financial hedging instruments are limited by company policy to foreign currency forward or option contracts and foreign currency debt 
the company enters into forward or option contracts with its bank or other financial institutions to accomplish its hedging strategy 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real and british pound 
gains and losses on these contracts principally consist of mark to market adjustments  recorded in earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 

table of contents we do not purchase or hold any such derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation or arbitrage 
see risk factors if we cannot manage additional challenges presented by our international operations  our revenues and profitability may suffer elsewhere in this report 
at present  we have million in debt obligations and there are no borrowings under our line of credit facility at december  as such  our interest rate risk is limited with respect to existing debt 
during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
