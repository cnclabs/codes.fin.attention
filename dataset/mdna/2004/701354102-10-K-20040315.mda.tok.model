on an on going basis  the company evaluates its significant estimates  which include allowance for bad debts and sales returns  inventory reserves  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for video division products  these criteria are generally met when product is shipped 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement and the fee associated with the transaction 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
the company assesses collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
service revenue is deferred until the service has been performed and the company has no significant remaining obligation to the customer 
revenue from extended support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period in which support services are to be performed  generally one to three years 
deferred revenue for services and support was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company s wireless division makes sales direct through its own website or through tigerdirect 
com  an internet retailer 
tigerdirect 
com is given business terms that allow for the return of unsold inventory 
in addition  the company currently offers a day money back guarantee on its wireless products 
with regard to sales through a distribution channel where the right to return unsold product exists  the company recognizes revenue on a sell through method utilizing information provided by the distribution channel 
in addition  since the company does not have sufficient history with sales of this nature to establish an estimate of expected returns  it has deferred of wireless product sales within the day guarantee period 
at december   the company has deferred revenue from sales of wireless products of approximately allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company s accounts receivable balance  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december   compared to  as of december  the allowance is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
management regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  age of the account balance and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the creditworthiness of the company s customers were to deteriorate  or if actual defaults are higher than historical experience  additional allowances would be required 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the reserve for product warranties was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company s pvtv products are generally covered by a warranty period of days and the company s camera and wireless products are covered by a one year warranty 
the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  a revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required and the company s gross margins could be adversely affected 
reserves for obsolete inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company s inventory balance  net of allowance  was  and  at december  and the inventory allowance was  at december   compared to  at december  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required and the company s gross margins could be adversely affected 
asset impairment the company estimates the economic lives of its long lived assets  including patents and other intangibles and evaluates the need for impairment of these assets based on the difference between the cost of the asset and the sum of estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if actual future cash flows are less favorable than those projected by management  an impairment charge may be required 
accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
for employee stock option grants  no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
if the company applied the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure it would recognize stock based employee compensation of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant amount of employee based stock compensation is due to the substantial number of options granted under these plans as well as the factors impacting the fair value calculation  including high price volatility of the company s common stock 
general the company has made significant investments in developing the technology and manufacturing capability for its products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
the company has not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset its operating expenses and has used the proceeds from the sale of its equity securities to fund its operations 
the company has executed an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its video division which is expected to close in the second quarter of the result of that sale will be the loss of revenue generated by that division with a related reduction in expenses 
therefore  the discussion below of the past three fiscal years should not be read as indicative of the future 
as a result of this transaction  the company expects its cash assets to be increased by the purchase price  less the expenses of the sale  its revenues to decline substantially and its expenses to be reduced to some degree  but not in proportion to the decline in revenues  as the video division has historically represented all or most of the revenue of the company  but only a portion of the operating expenses 
the company anticipates increases in revenues from the sale of its wireless products in  however the pending sale of its video division assets may result in an overall reduction of revenues in the ability for wireless revenues to offset costs is subject to the company continuing to expand its product line and attracting additional means of distribution  among other things 
the company intends to continue to use its working capital to support future marketing and sales and research and development activities for its products 
no assurance can be given that such expenditures will result in increased sales  new products  or technological advances or that the company has adequate capital to complete its products or gain market acceptance before requiring additional capital

revenues generated by the company s major product lines  including service and support related to those products  as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and are as follows pvtv systems cameraman systems support and other services wireless products represents less than video division the number of pvtv and stand alone cameraman systems sold and the average selling price per system for the years ended december   and were as follows pvtv systems camera systems avg 
selling avg 
selling systems price per systems price per sold system sold system the  decrease in revenues from to was due to a decrease in pvtv revenue of approximately  and a decrease in camera revenues of approximately  the decrease in pvtv revenue is due to a lower average selling price per system combined with a decrease in the number of systems sold 
the decline in average selling price is due to the mix of products sold and a price reduction implemented in on certain products 
the company believes the decrease in pvtv system sales is due to economic conditions in the broadcast market in the early part of as well as uncertainty among the broadcasters as to the company s plans for its video division 
the decline in pvtv system sales is expected to continue in due to the pending sale of video division assets to thomson as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decline in camera revenues from to was due to the discontinuation of the company s single chip camera line early in although the overall camera unit sales declined  the average selling price per system increased from  to  per system 
this increase is due to an increase in the percentage of three chip unit sales from approximately of total camera sales in to approximately in this increase was somewhat offset by a competitive driven price reduction implemented in for the company s camera products 
the company recently introduced a lower priced three chip camera system targeted at education and corporate environments and anticipates increased camera sales in with a lower average selling price per system 
the company s service and support revenue remained relatively stable from to despite the decline in pvtv system sales 
this is largely due to the timing of services in relation to system deliveries 
a significant portion of the service revenue relates to systems delivered late in in addition  the company s recurring support revenue from pvtv support contracts remained relatively unchanged from to this is due to a price reduction on support contracts late in  offset by a larger number of customers covered by such contracts as the company s installed base of pvtv users continues to grow 
the  increase in revenues from to was due to a  increase in pvtv system sales and a  increase in service and support revenue  offset by a  decrease in revenues from camera system sales 
the company believes the increase in pvtv system revenue was due to growing market acceptance of the pvtv automated production system among broadcasters 
in addition  the average selling price per pvtv system increased from approximately  in to  in due to the sale of higher end systems in larger broadcast markets 
the increase in service and support revenue was due to services related to the increased system sales and an overall increase in recurring support revenue due to a larger customer installed base 
the decline in camera revenues from to was anticipated with the company s announcement of the discontinuation of its single chip camera line early in the company s decision to discontinue this product line resulted from supply issues  declining demand and an increased focus on development and marketing of the pvtv systems 
although the overall camera unit sales declined  the average selling price per system increased from  to  per system 
this increase was due to an increase in the percentage of three chip unit sales from approximately of total camera sales in to approximately in wireless division in the fourth quarter of  the company s wireless division began selling its first dd based products  a wireless local area networking card for use in laptop computers and a wireless usb adaptor for desktop computers

com  an internet based retailer specializing in high tech electronic merchandise 
the average selling price of the wireless local area networking card was 
for sales through tigerdirect 
com  the company recognizes revenue on a sell through basis  that is  when the product is sold through to the end user 
this is determined based on information received from tigerdirect 
com 
in addition  the company currently offers a day money back guarantee on its wireless products 
since the company does not have sufficient history with sales of this nature to establish an estimate of expected returns  it has deferred of wireless product sales within the day guarantee period 
at december   the company has deferred revenue from sales of wireless products of approximately  the company is exploring additional channels of marketing and commercial product distribution including manufacturer representative arrangements for introduction of the company s products to retail store fronts and value added reseller relationships 
while the company strives for consistent revenue growth  there can be no assurance that consistent revenue growth or profitability can be achieved 
the company s ability to achieve revenue growth is dependent upon many factors  including market acceptance of new products and technologies  ability of vendors to supply key components  development of new products in a timely manner  and the ability of the company to build brand recognition and distribution 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or even maintain its current level of revenues on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
gross margin the gross margin for products and services for the years ended december were as follows products    services   total    the decrease in the company s product margin from to was due to the decreased revenues from product sales  resulting in the absorption of relatively fixed overhead  indirect labor costs and provisions for obsolete inventory over a lower volume of production 
in addition  pvtv systems  which carry higher margins than camera systems  represented a lower percentage of total product revenue in compared to and the mix of pvtv systems sold in  as evidenced by the lower selling price per system  were lower margin systems than those sold in the increase in product margin from to was due to the shift in revenues from cameras to pvtv systems that have a higher gross margin per system sale 
this increase was somewhat offset by decreases in margins resulting from the obsolescence of certain parts in connection with discontinuation of the single chip camera system in the company strives to improve its gross margin through product pricing  labor efficiencies  and product design 
there can be no assurance  however that gross margins in will improve over  or remain stable with  the gross margins attained in gross margins in may be negatively impacted by fluctuating component costs  a declining sales trend in the video division  and the production costs associated with new product introductions in the wireless division 
the company s service revenue  which primarily represents training and support services related to pvtv system sales  historically has had zero to slightly negative margins 
this is due in part to pricing pressures on the company s charges for services  under utilization of training and support staff at times due to customer scheduling requirements  and the cost involved in training technical support staff 
as the company s pvtv customer installed base increases  the efficiencies of the technical support staff are expected to increase as well  resulting in improved margins

the company made reductions in its wireless engineering staffing late in the third quarter of due to severance costs and the timing of staff reductions  the full benefits of these reductions will not be evidenced through decreases in research and development expenses until the increase in research and development expenses from to was due to increased wireless chip development expenses and increased overhead from the expansion of the orlando wireless facility 
the company closed its california wireless development facility at the end of  and transferred those development efforts to its orlando facility 
the markets for the company s products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions

although management expects increases in revenues from sales of its wireless products in  these revenues are not likely to offset the anticipated decline in revenues from the video division 
the company s ability to increase wireless product revenues will largely depend upon the rate at which the company is able to secure additional distribution channels  increase brand recognition and customer demand for its products and increase production volumes sufficiently to meet such demand
