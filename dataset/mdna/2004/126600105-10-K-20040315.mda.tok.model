for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations capital resources 
employees at december   we employed persons  on a full time and on a part time basis 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
competition the banking and financial services industry is highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we compete for loans  deposits  and customers with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  securities and brokerage companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions  and other nonbank financial service providers 
many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of financial services 
economic conditions  government policies  legislation  and regulation our profitability  like most financial institutions  is primarily dependent on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates received by us on our interest earning assets  such as loans extended to its clients and securities held in its investment portfolio  will initially comprise the major portion of our earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  such as inflation  recession and unemployment  and the impact which future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on us cannot be predicted 
our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession through its open market operations in us government securities by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements  and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the nature and impact on us of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation  as well as regulations  are enacted which have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities  or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies  and other financial institutions and financial services providers are frequently made by the us congress  by the state legislature  and various regulatory agencies 
this legislation may change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions  and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it  or any implementing regulations  would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
supervision and regulation general bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
this regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of our shareholders 
set forth below is a summary description of the material laws and regulations which relate to our operations 
the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations 
cvb cvb is a registered bank holding company  and subject to regulation and examination by the frb under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca 
we are required to file with the frb periodic reports and such additional information as the frb may require 
the frb may require that we terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries  affiliates or investments when the frb believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries 
the frb also has the authority to regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt  including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt 
under certain circumstances  we must file written notice and obtain frb approval prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities 
further  we are required by the frb to maintain certain levels of capital 
see capital standards 
we are required to obtain prior frb approval for the acquisition of more than of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company 
prior frb approval is also required for the merger or consolidation of cvb and another bank holding company 
we are prohibited by the bhca  except in certain statutorily prescribed instances  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or furnishing services to its subsidiaries 
however  subject to the prior frb approval  we may engage in any  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities that the frb deems to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
under frb regulations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to our subsidiary banks and may not conduct operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
in addition  it is the frb s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the frb to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of frb regulations or both 
cvb is also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
as such  cvb and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the california department of financial institutions 
our securities are registered with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
as such  we are subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading  corporate governance  and other requirements and restrictions of the exchange act 
the bank as a california chartered bank  the bank is subject to primary supervision  periodic examination  and regulation by the california commissioner of financial institutions commissioner and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  as well as certain regulations promulgated by the frb 
if  as a result of an examination of the bank  the fdic should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of our operations are unsatisfactory or that we are violating or have violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to the fdic 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict our growth  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  and ultimately to terminate our deposit insurance  which would result in a revocation of the bank s charter 
the commissioner separately has many of the same remedial powers 
because california permits commercial banks chartered by the state to engage in any activity permissible for national banks  we can form subsidiaries to engage in expanded financial activities  to the same extent as a national bank 
however  in order to form a financial subsidiary  we must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital deduction  risk management and affiliate transaction rules as applicable to national banks 
generally  a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental thereto  even though they are not permissible for the national bank itself 
the definition of financial in nature includes  among other items  underwriting  dealing in or making a market in securities  including  for example  distributing shares of mutual funds 
the subsidiary may not  however  engage as principal in underwriting insurance  issue annuities or engage in real estate development or investment or merchant banking 
the sarbanes oxley act of on july   president bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of this new legislation addresses accounting oversight and corporate governance matters  including the creation of a five member oversight board appointed by the securities exchange commission that will set standards for accountants and have investigative and disciplinary powers  the prohibition of accounting firms from providing various types of consulting services to public clients and requiring accounting firms to rotate partners among public client assignments every five years  increased penalties for financial crimes  expanded disclosure of corporate operations and internal controls and required executive certification of financial presentations  increased requirements for board audit committees and their members  enhanced controls on  and reporting of  insider trading  and statutory separations between investment bankers and analysts 
the new legislation and its implementing regulations will result in increased costs of compliance  including certain outside professional costs 
usa patriot act of the usa patriot act of and its implementing regulations significantly expanded the anti money laundering and financial transparency laws  including due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons  standards for verifying customer identification at account opening and maintaining expanded records  rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering  reports by non financial businesses filed with the us treasury department for cash transactions exceeding  and suspicious activities reports securities by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating us laws and regulations 
merchant banking restrictions while the bhca generally prohibits bank holding companies from owning more than percent of the voting stock of non financial companies  with limited exceptions  financial holding companies are permitted to engage in merchant banking activities 
permissible merchant banking investments are defined as investments that meet two important requirements the investment may only be held for a period of time to enable the resale of the investment generally current regulations allow for a year holding period for direct investments and a year holding period for investments in private equity funds  and while the investment is held by the financial holding company  the investing financial holding company may not routinely manage or operate the commercial firm except as necessary or required to obtain a reasonable return on the investment on resale 
in addition  there are limits on bank funding of portfolio companies controlled by the bank s parent financial holding company  transactions between the bank and portfolio companies and on cross marketing activities between banks and portfolio companies owned by the same financial holding company 
however  current rules do not prevent a depository institution from marketing the shares of private equity funds controlled by an affiliated financial holding company  and do not apply to situations in which the financial holding company owns less than percent of the voting shares of the portfolio company 
furthermore  capital requirements for merchant banking activities and certain other equity investments employ a sliding scale based on each banking organization s aggregate equity investments in non financial entities and tier i capital  requiring banks or holding companies to hold regulatory capital equal to cents for every of equity investments up to of tier i capital  cents for every of investments for the next of tier i capital  and cents for every exceeding of tier i capital 
the first of investments that banking companies make through small business investment companies sbics is exempt  however  the sliding scale applies for any such investments over 
fair and accurate credit transactions act in december  president bush signed into law the fair and accurate credit transactions act fact act  which sets new obligations for financial firms to help deter identity theft and give consumers more control of their credit data 
it also reauthorizes a federal ban on state laws that interfere with corporate credit granting and marketing practices 
the frb and the federal trade commission ftc are required to draft regulations to implement the fact act 
it is not possible at this time to determine the impact of such regulations that are to be drafted  however  the frb and ftc recently announced that businesses will have until december  to comply with the new initiatives 
privacy federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
cvb has implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
in recent years  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
for example  in  california adopted standards that are tougher than federal law  allowing bank customers the opportunity to bar financial companies from sharing information with their affiliates 
on december   the sec issued the advance notice of proposed rulemaking along with the federal banking agencies and other government agencies seeking comment on whether they should consider amending current regulations to allow or require financial institutions to provide alternative types of privacy notices  such as a short privacy notice  that would be easier for consumers to understand 
the concept release lists more than questions regarding which the agencies seek comment from the public  organized in the following categories goals of a privacy notice  elements of a privacy notice  language of a privacy notice  format of a privacy notice  mandatory and permissible aspects of a privacy notice  costs and benefits of a short notice  and other categories 
interagency guidance on response programs to protect against identity theft on august   the federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies requested public comment on proposed guidance that would require financial institutions to develop programs to respond to incidents of unauthorized access to customer information  including procedures for notifying customers under certain circumstances 
the proposed guidance including interprets previously issued interagency customer information security guidelines that require financial institutions to implement information security programs designed to protect their customers information  and describes the components of a response program and sets a standard for providing notice to customers affected by unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to those customers  thereby reducing the risk of losses due to fraud or identity theft 
we are not able at this time to determine the impact of any such proposed guidance on our financial condition or results of operation 
dividends and other transfers of funds dividends from the bank constitute the principal source of income to the cvb 
cvb is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the cvb 
under such restrictions  the amount available for payment of dividends to cvb by the bank totaled million at december  in addition  the bank s regulators have the authority to prohibit the bank from paying dividends  depending upon the bank s financial condition  if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
transactions with affiliates the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to  or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of  cvb and other affiliates  the purchase of  or investments in  stock or other securities thereof  the taking of such securities as collateral for loans  and the purchase of assets of cvb and other affiliates 
such restrictions prevent cvb and other affiliates from borrowing from bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
further  such secured loans and investments by the bank to or in cvb or to or in any other affiliates are limited  individually  to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations  and such secured loans and investments are limited  in the aggregate  to of our capital and surplus 
some of the entities included in the definition of an affiliate are parent companies  sister banks  sponsored and advised companies  investment companies whereby the bank its affiliate serves as investment advisor  and financial subsidiaries of the bank 
additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates may be imposed on us under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
see prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms 
capital standards the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based minimum capital guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk federal banking agencies  to for assets with relatively high credit risk 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risk 
under the capital guidelines  a banking organization s total capital is divided into tiers 
tier i capital consists of common equity  qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries including trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
not more than of qualifying tier i capital may consist of trust preferred securities 
tier ii capital consists of hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt  mandatory convertible debt securities  a limited amount of subordinated debt  preferred stock that does not qualify as tier i capital  a limited amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses and a limited amount of unrealized holding gains on equity securities 
tier iii capital consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt 
the sum of tier ii and tier iii capital may not exceed the amount of tier i capital 
the guidelines require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier i capital to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier i capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets must be 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
on july   the federal reserve bank issued supervisory letter sr clarifying that bank holding companies should continue to report trust preferred securities in accordance with current federal reserve bank instructions which allows trust preferred securities to be counted in tier i capital subject to certain limitations 
the federal reserve has indicated it will review the implications of any accounting treatment changes and  if necessary or warranted  will provide appropriate guidance 
in the event these capital instruments are no longer allowed to be included as tier capital  the capital position of cvb could be adversely affected 
trust preferred securities currently make up of cvb s tier capital 
this would not affect the capital position of the bank 
the following table presents the amounts of regulatory capital and the capital ratios for the company  compared to its minimum regulatory capital requirements as of december  we have included two calculations  one including the trust preferred securities in capital and one excluding the trust preferred securities from capital 
we did this to indicate the impact on our capital ratios should the frb decide to exclude trust preferred securities from a calculation of a holding company s tier i capital 
as of december  without trust with trust without trust with trust preferred preferred required preferred preferred amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amounts in thousands leverage ratio tier risk based ratio total risk based ratio the following table presents the amounts of regulatory capital and the capital ratios for the bank  compared to its minimum regulatory capital requirements as of december  the capital ratio for the bank will not be impacted by any decision on trust preferred securities by the frb since these securities are at the cvb level and not at the bank level 
as of december  actual required excess amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amounts in thousands leverage ratio tier risk based ratio total risk based ratio in addition  federal banking regulators may set capital requirements higher than the minimums described above for financial institutions whose circumstances warrant it 
for example  a financial institution experiencing or anticipating significant growth may be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
predatory lending the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation asset based lending inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced loan flipping engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
frb regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widen the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 
the following triggers coverage under the act interest rates for first lien mortgage loans in excess of percentage points above comparable treasury securities  subordinate lien loans of percentage points above treasury securities  and fees such as optional insurance and similar debt protection costs paid in connection with the credit transaction  when combined with points and fees if deemed excessive 
in addition  the regulation bars loan flipping by the same lender or loan servicer within a year 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans shouldn t be made to people unable to repay them unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
we do not expect these rules and potential state action in this area to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed  based on its capital ratios well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
at december   both the bank and cvb exceeded the required ratios for classification as well capitalized 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
finally  pursuant to an interagency agreement  the fdic can examine any institution that has a substandard regulatory examination score or is considered undercapitalized without the express permission of the institution s primary regulator 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset growth  v earnings  and vi compensation  fees and benefits 
in addition  the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards 
these guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating 
under these standards  an insured depository institution should i conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets  ii estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses  iii compare problem asset totals to capital  iv take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets  v consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations  and vi provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk 
these new guidelines also set forth standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
premiums for deposit insurance through the bank insurance fund bif  the fdic insures the deposits of the bank up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each bif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors 
specifically  the assessment rate is based on the institution s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category 
an institution s capitalization risk category is based on the fdic s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
an institution s supervisory subgroup category is based on the fdic s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be required 
fdic insured depository institutions pay an assessment rate equal to the rate assessed on deposits insured by the savings association insurance fund saif 
the assessment rate currently ranges from zero to cents per of domestic deposits 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi annual basis 
due to continued growth in deposits and some recent bank failures  the bif is nearing its minimum ratio of of insured deposits as mandated by law 
if the ratio drops below  it is likely the fdic will be required to assess premiums on all banks 
any increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings  depending on the amount of the increase 
furthermore  the fdic is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for one or more of the company s subsidiary depository institutions could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings  depending on the collective size of the particular institutions involved 
all fdic insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board 
the bonds  commonly referred to as fico bonds  were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the fdic established the fico assessment rates effective for the first half of at approximately cents for each of assessable deposits 
the fico assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the fdic s insurance funds and do not vary depending on a depository institution s capitalization or supervisory evaluations 
interstate banking and branching banks have the ability  subject to certain state restrictions  to acquire by acquisition or merger branches outside its home state 
the establishment of new interstate branches is also possible in those states with laws that expressly permit it 
interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located 
competition may increase further as banks branch across state lines and enter new markets 
community reinvestment act and fair lending developments the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving home mortgage lending operations and community reinvestment act activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
a bank may be subject to substantial penalties and corrective measures for a violation of certain fair lending laws 
the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra obligations into account when regulating and supervising other activities 
furthermore  financial institutions are subject to annual reporting and public disclosure requirements for certain written agreements that are entered into between insured depository institutions or their affiliates and nongovernmental entities or persons that are made pursuant to  or in connection with  the fulfillment of the cra 
a bank s compliance with its cra obligations is based a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on an institution s lending service and investment performance 
when a bank holding company applies for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the frb will review the assessment of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
based on the last examination conducted february   the bank received a satisfactory rating 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
as an fhlb member  we would be required to own capital stock in an fhlb in an amount equal to the greater of of its aggregate outstanding principal amount of its residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each calendar year  or of its fhlb advances or borrowings 
a new capital plan of the fhlb sf was approved by the federal housing finance board and will be implemented on april  the new capital plan incorporates a single class of stock with a par value of per share  and may be issued  exchanged  redeemed  and repurchased only at par value 
each member to own stock in amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or an activity based stock requirement based on percentage of outstanding advances 
the new capital stock is redeemable on five years written notice  subject to certain conditions 
we do not believe that the initial implementation of the fhlb sf new capital plan as approved will have a material impact upon our financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
however  we could be required to purchase as much as additional capital stock or sell as much as of its proposed capital stock requirement at the discretion of the fhlb sf 
federal reserve system the federal reserve board requires all depository institutions to maintain non interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts primarily checking  now  and super now checking accounts and non personal time deposits 
at december   we were in compliance with these requirements 
nonbank subsidiaries the company s nonbank subsidiaries also are subject to regulation by the frb and other applicable federal and state agencies 
risk factors that may affect future results in addition to other information contained in this report  the following discusses certain factors which may adversely affect our business financial results and operations and should be considered in evaluating the company 
our southern california business focus and economic conditions in southern california could adversely affect our operations 
our operations are located in san bernardino county  riverside county  orange county  kern county  and the eastern portion of los angeles county in southern california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
a deterioration in economic conditions or a natural or manmade disaster in our market area could have a material adverse impact on the quality of our loan portfolio  the demand for our products and services  and our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings 
our earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates impact the level of loans  deposits and investments  the credit profile of existing loans and the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
significant fluctuations in interest rates may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to government regulations that could limit or restrict our activities  which in turn could adversely impact our operations 
the financial services industry is subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation 
significant new laws or changes in existing laws  or repeals of existing laws may cause our results to differ materially 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects credit conditions for us and a material change in these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
competition may adversely affect our performance 
the banking and financial services businesses in our market areas are highly competitive 
we face competition in attracting deposits and in making loans 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
the results of the company in the future may differ depending the nature or level of competition 
if a significant number of borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform as required by the terms of their loans  we will sustain losses 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
we have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  that management believes are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may face other risks 
from time to time  we detail other risks with respect to our business and or financial results in our filings with the commission
