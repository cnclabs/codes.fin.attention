item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents proprietary rights and licenses we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and  while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
we have entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers and channel partners requiring the release of our source code under certain conditions 
generally  such agreements provide that such parties will have a limited  nonexclusive right to use such code in the event that there is an undismissed bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  if we cease to do business or if we materially fail to meet our contractual obligations 
the release of source code may increase the likelihood of misappropriation by third parties 
we currently have a small number of patents relating to our products  including eight united states patents  three foreign patents and a number of patent applications pending in the united states and abroad 
there can be no assurance that our patents will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged by applicable governmental patent examiners  will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that other companies will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents owned by us 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with our internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  any such software licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we distribute our products under software license agreements that grant customers a nonexclusive  nontransferable license to use our products and contain terms and conditions prohibiting the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our products 
generally  we do not provide end users with the source code for our products except under the escrow arrangements described above

critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from licensing our software products and providing maintenance  consulting and training services 
our standard software license agreement is a perpetual license to use our products on an end user  concurrent user or central processing unit basis 
we record revenue from licensing our software products to end users provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of the product has occurred  as prescribed by statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
for arrangements with multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements based upon the residual method in accordance with sop  modifications of sop with respect to certain transactions 
amounts billed or payments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
maintenance agreements are generally twelve month prepaid contracts that are recognized ratably over the service period 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is measured by the stated renewal rates included in the agreements 

table of contents customers may also enter into arrangements that are typically on a time and materials basis for consulting and training services 
vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services is based upon the standard hourly rate we charge for such services when sold separately 
training services are generally prepaid prior to rendering the service 
consulting and training revenues are typically recognized as earned 
consulting revenues are generated primarily from implementation services related to the installation of our products 
these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from the license revenue because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop our services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software 
our products are fully functional upon delivery of the product and implementation does not require significant modification or alteration 
factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include  but are not limited to degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
payments related to the software product to which the services relate are typically billed independently from the services and  therefore  are not coincident with performance of such services 
license agreements generally do not include acceptance provisions 
in the infrequent circumstance where an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the license and service elements  license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts and accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered  services have been performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
license revenue from resellers or distributors is recognized upon sell through to the end customer 
if we determine that collection of a license fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
accounts receivable allowances we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are based upon a review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are made at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these provisions  we analyze several factors  including our historical collection experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the accounts receivable allowances does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  we may record additional provisions for accounts receivable allowances 
we record the provision for accounts receivable allowances in general and administrative expense and as a reduction of revenue in order to match the underlying cause of the provision to the appropriate classification in our statement of operations 
our accounts receivable allowance was million at june  and million at june  the total provision for accounts receivable allowances was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
of these provisions  million  million and million were recorded in general and administrative expense in fiscal  and  respectively  and million  million and million were recorded as a reduction of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the statements of operations 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily relating to foreign net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  additional valuation allowances may need to be recorded  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  and long lived assets we account for goodwill under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires us to review for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this impairment review involves a two step process as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that we have only a single reporting unit  and we are required to make estimates regarding the fair value of that reporting unit when testing for potential impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using the market approach 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on our market capitalization 
our determination that we have only a single reporting unit and the method used to estimate the fair value of that reporting unit require significant judgment 
we account for finite lived intangibles and long lived assets under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  iii significant decrease in the market value of the assets and iv significant negative industry or economic trends 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on the estimated future discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors that may change in the near term 
results of operations we acquired brio software  inc on october  brio s results of operations have been included in hyperion s results beginning on the date of acquisition 
in addition to the incremental revenue streams associated with brio products and services  our headcount increased by approximately in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the acquisition 
revenues year ended june  percent of percent of percent of total total total in thousands revenue revenue revenue software licenses maintenance and services maintenance consulting and training total revenues total revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the change in foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal by approximately million and favorably affected total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal by approximately million  in both cases primarily due to the strength of the euro against the us dollar 
excluding the impact of foreign currency rate changes  total revenues would have increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and would have declined slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents software license revenue 
software license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while the fiscal license revenue growth was predominantly attributable to sales of hyperion performance suite  the former brio products  we also experienced balanced growth across our financial application product portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of our platform products in fiscal compared to fiscal software license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in license revenue in fiscal was primarily due to increased revenues from two of our newer application products  hyperion planning and hyperion financial management 
these two products were still in the early stages of their product life cycles during most of fiscal  but they began making significant contributions to total license revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal and into fiscal these increases in application product sales were offset to some extent by declines in revenue from our older  standalone application products  hyperion pillar and hyperion enterprise  and our platform products 
we market our products through our direct sales force and through channel partners 
to date  we have generated the majority of our license revenue through our direct sales force  but we continue to focus on complementing our direct sales force with channel partners  which include original equipment manufacturers  value added resellers  system integrators and independent distributors 
license revenue from channel partners comprised of total license revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the percentage of license revenue derived from our channel partners can fluctuate between periods  as it is sensitive to individual large transactions that are neither predictable nor consistent in size or timing 
no single channel partner represented more than of total revenues during the periods presented 
maintenance and services revenue 
maintenance and services revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  which was comprised of a increase in maintenance revenue and a increase in consulting and training services revenue 
maintenance and services revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  which was comprised of a increase in maintenance revenue and a decrease in consulting and training services revenue 
the increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal was primarily attributable to our acquisition of brio in october and  to a lesser extent  to year over year growth of our installed customer base and improvements in our invoicing and collecting procedures for maintenance renewals  which was offset slightly by cancelled maintenance contracts 
the increase in consulting and training services revenue in fiscal was principally due to our acquisition of brio in october and  to a lesser extent  to increased utilization rates in our consulting organization 
the increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal was primarily due to additional sales of software to our customers and improvements in our invoicing and collecting procedures for maintenance renewals  which was offset slightly by cancelled maintenance contracts 
during fiscal and fiscal  we analyzed our customer portfolio to identify customers who may have been receiving maintenance services but were not paying for such services 
this initiative resulted in the recognition of maintenance revenues from billings to customers in fiscal for maintenance services provided in prior periods 
the decrease in consulting revenue in fiscal was primarily due to our continued focus on increasing the use of channel partners to provide consulting services for our customers 
as part of this effort  we reduced headcount in our north american consulting organization by approximately employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal and further reduced consulting headcount by approximately employees during fiscal cost of revenues year ended june  percent of percent of percent of related related related in thousands revenue revenue revenue software licenses maintenance and services cost of software license revenue 
cost of software license revenue consists primarily of royalty expenses  amortization of capitalized software development costs  amortization of acquired technologies  and the cost of product packaging and documentation materials 
cost of software license revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while software license revenue increased 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in royalty expense resulting from a different mix of product sales as well as the termination of our oem relationship with crystal decisions 
partially offsetting the decrease in royalty expense in fiscal was a slight increase in acquired technology amortization expense primarily resulting from our acquisitions of brio in october and the alcar group in april 
table of contents cost of software license revenue remained relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal while software license revenue increased 
this was primarily due to a million decrease in royalty expenses due to a different mix of product sales and a million decrease in product packaging and documentation material costs due to our increased use of electronic product distribution 
these decreases were substantially offset by a million increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs and a million increase in amortization of acquired technologies 
gross margin on software license revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  and  we capitalized million  million  and million of software development costs  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the amounts capitalized relate to localization costs for our software products 
capitalized software product development costs are amortized over the estimated economic lives of the products  which is generally three years 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs begins upon the general release of the software to customers 
cost of maintenance and services revenue 
cost of maintenance and services revenue consists largely of compensation and benefits for support  consulting and training personnel 
cost of maintenance and services revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in cost of maintenance and services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally due to a million increase in employee expenses and a million increase in subcontractor and other external personnel costs  both of which primarily resulted from our acquisition of brio in october maintenance and services headcount grew to employees at june  from employees at june   primarily due to the addition of incremental brio employees 
cost of maintenance and services revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily attributable to our continued focus on leveraging our channel partners to perform consulting services for our customers 
as a result of this effort  we reduced headcount in our north american consulting organization by approximately employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal and further reduced consulting headcount by approximately employees during fiscal this reduction in headcount contributed to a million decrease in employee expenses for maintenance and services personnel in fiscal compared to fiscal further  independent contractor and temporary staffing expenses decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our decreased use of external personnel for product implementations for customers 
gross margin on maintenance and services revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in gross margin on maintenance and services revenue in fiscal was due to increased consulting utilization rates and  to a lesser extent  due to a higher mix of maintenance revenue as a percentage of total maintenance and services revenues 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue as a percentage of total maintenance and services revenue 
maintenance revenue as a percentage of total maintenance and services revenue increased in fiscal due to maintenance revenue increases  as discussed above  as well as consulting revenue decreases due to our increased use of channel partners to provide consulting services 
operating expenses year ended june  percent of percent of percent of total total total in thousands revenue revenue revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was mainly due to a million increase in employee expenses that resulted primarily from our acquisition of brio in october and a higher effective commission rate in fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing headcount grew to employees at june  from employees at june   primarily due to the addition of incremental brio employees 

table of contents sales and marketing expense increased to million in fiscal from million fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in marketing expenses resulting from a heavier focus on a wide variety of demand generation activities 
we also increased spending in the area of brand building and the advancement of business performance management thought leadership 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to a million increase in employee expenses that resulted primarily from our acquisition of brio in october research and development headcount grew to employees at june  from employees at june   primarily due to the addition of incremental brio employees 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in salaries and related employee expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was principally due to an million increase in employee expenses that resulted primarily from our acquisition of brio in october general and administrative headcount grew to employees at june  from employees at june   primarily due to the addition of incremental brio employees 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in bad debt expense resulting from improvements in the quality of our accounts receivable portfolio  a million decrease in outsourcing costs  as we ended the outsourcing of our north american accounting department in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million decrease in occupancy and equipment costs primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  as many fixed assets became fully depreciated during fiscal  and a million decrease in charges related to property and sales tax audits 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in salaries and related employee expenses resulting primarily from headcount increases as we brought our north american accounting function in house 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of brio in october  management approved and initiated plans to restructure the operations of hyperion to eliminate certain duplicative activities and reduce the combined company s cost structure 
consequently  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million in fiscal  including million of employee severance costs and million of facility closure costs 
in june  we announced a corporate restructuring plan designed to bring costs more in line with revenues and strengthen the financial performance of the company  which resulted in a reduction of the workforce by approximately  or of worldwide headcount 
employee groups impacted by the restructuring included personnel involved in corporate services  product business units  sales and customer support 
in addition  we consolidated some of our facilities and exited other facilities 
in fiscal  and  we made adjustments to the restructuring charges recorded in fiscal totaling million  million and million  respectively 
these adjustments resulted primarily from changes to our estimates of sublease income related to our facility exit costs and did not represent new restructuring activities 
a summary of restructuring and other charges and the related accrual balance is as follows in thousands severance facilities other total accrual balance at june  adjustments cash payments accrual balance at june  adjustments cash payments accrual balance at june  restructuring charges and adjustments cash payments accrual balance at june  
table of contents the remaining accrual balance at june  of million relates primarily to future lease obligations 
of this amount  million is included in other current liabilities and million is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
payments due under long term lease obligations will continue to be made over the remaining lives of the leases 
if we are unable to maintain a cost structure that is in appropriate balance with revenue going forward  whether due to failure to increase revenue adequately or failure to keep costs down  we could find it necessary to further adjust our cost structure through the execution of additional restructuring plans 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we signed an engineering consulting agreement with a consulting firm based in bangalore  india in an effort to increase our multi shore development capacity and capability 
the expansion of our multi shore initiative will be gradual over fiscal and will ultimately result in about to additional developers contributing to our development efforts in india 
because of this initiative  in july we reduced our us based development staff by approximately employees  or approximately of our development headcount  and will record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
this restructuring charge consists of severance and related benefits costs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we signed a lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters facility located in santa clara  california that will accommodate all employees in our existing leased facilities in san francisco  sunnyvale and santa clara  california 
in july  we vacated our san francisco facility and will record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
we expect to vacate our existing sunnyvale and santa clara facilities in the second quarter of fiscal  which will result in additional restructuring charges in the second quarter of approximately million 
in process research and development during fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of brio  we recorded a charge of million related to the write off of in process research and development costs 
interest and other income interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to declines in short term interest rates 
interest and other expense interest and other expense consists primarily of interest paid and amortization of deferred issuance costs related to our convertible subordinated notes

in addition  we repurchased convertible subordinated notes with face values totaling million during the fourth quarter of fiscal these repurchases significantly contributed to the decrease in interest and other expense in fiscal compared to fiscal gain loss on redemption of debt during the second quarter of fiscal  we redeemed our remaining convertible subordinated notes with face values totaling million 
this redemption resulted in the recognition of a loss of million in fiscal  which was comprised of the redemption premium paid as well as the write off of associated deferred issuance costs

as of june   we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional million of common stock under the repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors in may we expect to continue to repurchase shares of common stock under this plan in fiscal  subject to market conditions 
we intend to fund our capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as well as cash generated from future operations  if any 
however  capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of development projects and increases in operating expenses  all of which are subject to uncertainty 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  and cash generated from our future operations  if any  will be sufficient to finance our business through at least june  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations will be impacted by changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products as well as our ability to manage operating expenses and achieve further operational efficiencies

 earnings per share 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  we adopted eitf on april   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
related party transactions in fiscal and  siebel systems purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of software  maintenance and services from us for purposes of implementing an enterprise wide financial planning system 
in addition  siebel has a future option to purchase the same products in accordance with normal contractual terms and conditions

table of contents factors that may affect future results we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
product enhancement and new product introductions involve inherent risks 
hyperion competes in a market characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware and software development  evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
hyperion continually seeks to expand and refresh its product offerings to include newer features or products  and enter into agreements allowing integration of third party technology into hyperion s products 
the introduction of new products or updated versions of continuing products has inherent risks  including  but not limited to product quality  including the possibility of software defects  the fit of the new products and features with the customer s needs  the successful adaptation of third party technology into hyperion s products  educating hyperion s sales  marketing and consulting personnel to work with the new products and features  competition from earlier and more established entrants  market acceptance of initial product releases  marketing effectiveness  and the accuracy of assumptions about the nature of customer demand 
hyperion s failure to successfully introduce  market and sell new products and technologies  enhance and improve existing products in a timely manner  and properly position and or price hyperion s products  and undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of a product and or the failure of anticipated market growth could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations or financial position 
these risks tend to be greater when newer products make up a larger portion of the overall product mix 
as more and more of these newer products are deployed  hyperion s service and maintenance organizations  along with its partners  must rapidly increase their ability to install and service these products  and hyperion must rapidly improve their ease of implementation and ease of use 
the failure to successfully increase these capacities and make these improvements could result in significantly lower customer satisfaction  which could lead to lower revenues and profits 
for fiscal  important newer products or product enhancements include performance suite and essbase hyperion operates in a very competitive environment 
the markets in which hyperion competes are intensely competitive  highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
hyperion has experienced  and expects it will continue to experience  vigorous competition from current competitors and new competitors  some of whom may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than hyperion does 
cognos competes with hyperion across a wide range of products  offering what they refer to as corporate performance management solutions  as do  generally  the major erp vendors  including sap  microsoft  oracle and peoplesoft 
many other companies compete in specific areas of hyperion s business 
sas and peoplesoft have olap products and analytic applications  business objects and cognos have query and reporting products  and numerous smaller vendors offer specific applications that compete with a single hyperion product 
hyperion expects additional competition as other established and emerging companies  including microsoft  peoplesoft  sap and oracle  move further into both the application and platform parts of the business performance management software market 
this competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would materially adversely affect hyperion s business  operating results and financial condition 
if hyperion is unable to develop or acquire new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance  hyperion may be unable to recoup product development costs  and hyperion s earnings and revenue may decline 
hyperion s future success depends on its ability to address the rapidly changing needs of its customers by developing or acquiring new products and introducing such products  product updates and services on a timely basis 
hyperion must also extend the operation of its products to new platforms and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
hyperion commits substantial resources to developing new software products and services 
if the markets for these new products do not develop as anticipated  or demand for hyperion s products and services in these markets does not materialize or occurs more slowly than hyperion expects  hyperion will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenue  and hyperion s business and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents failure to upgrade older products will adversely affect revenue 
as newer products are introduced by hyperion  or by its competition  the market s demand for hyperion s older products declines 
declining demand reduces revenue from additional licenses  and reduces maintenance revenue from past purchasers of hyperion s software 
we must continually upgrade hyperion s older products in order for hyperion s customers to continue to see value in hyperion s maintenance services 
if hyperion is unable to provide continued improvements in functionality  or  alternatively  move customers from hyperion s older products to hyperion s newer products  declining maintenance and new license revenue from older products could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business 
hyperion typically has back ended quarters 
quarterly revenues and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of the signing of licensing agreements and product deliveries during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
significant portions of hyperion s quarterly software licensing agreements are concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter  generally with a concentration of such revenues in the final week of that month 
due to the relatively fixed nature of certain costs  including personnel and facilities expenses  a decline or shortfall in quarterly and or annual revenues typically results in lower profitability or may result in losses 
prior to the very end of any quarter  hyperion must rely on hyperion s forecasts of revenue for planning  modeling and other purposes 
however  forecasts are only estimates and may not correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
consequently  a significant discrepancy between actual results and sales forecasts could cause hyperion to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect hyperion s business or results of operations 
any publicly stated revenue or earnings projections by hyperion are especially subject to this risk 
a change in pricing or marketing could adversely affect hyperion s business 
in an effort to simplify and clarify hyperion s product positioning and marketing  hyperion periodically makes changes to hyperion s product pricing or product descriptions 
any product price reductions may not be offset by sufficient increases in unit sales to maintain or increase license revenues  and any broadly based changes to pricing or marketing messages could cause customers to change or delay their purchasing decisions in response to such revisions 
additional risks of such changes include delays in transactions as hyperion s sales force learns how to deploy the new pricing or convey hyperion s new marketing messages and delay or loss of revenues as the competition reacts to the pricing and marketing changes  any of which could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations or financial position 
hyperion may not be able to continue its operational improvements 
as part of hyperion s focus on improving its operating margins  hyperion is driving toward increased efficiencies in hyperion s sales force  as well as hyperion s services  product development  product marketing  finance  information technology  human resources and other administrative processes 
the ability to continue to realize current efficiencies and find ways to improve on past performance is crucial to the improvement of operating margins 
any increase in the relative cost of these functions  or failure to continue to realize current efficiencies  could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s profits 
reorganizations may adversely affect productivity 
hyperion has continued to make adjustments to hyperion s operations and organization 
these changes have historically resulted in productivity declines in the short term 
the revised operations and or organization must keep improving over past performance in order to provide better operating margins and efficiencies 
failure to maintain or improve momentum and productivity could materially adversely impact hyperion s revenue and profits 
hyperion s international operations are subject to significant risks 
hyperion derives a substantial portion of its revenue from customers located outside of the united states 
hyperion s international operations are subject to risks  including potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  imposition of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and employment restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates and inflation  which could reduce hyperion s customers ability to obtain financing for software products or which could make hyperion s products more expensive in those countries  
table of contents difficulties in hedging foreign currency transaction exposures  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in staffing and managing its international operations  including difficulties related to administering hyperion s stock option plan in some foreign countries  difficulties in coordinating the activities of hyperion s geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations  competition from local suppliers  costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages  and political unrest  war or terrorism  particularly in areas in which hyperion has facilities 
hyperion may not be able to successfully address each of these challenges 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect results 
hyperion conducts a significant portion of its business in currencies other than the united states dollar 
hyperion s operating results are  therefore  subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
hyperion s revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the united states dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the united states dollar weakens 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the euro  relative to the value of the united states dollar positively affected revenues and operating results in fiscal and if the united states dollar strengthens relative to other currencies in the future  our revenues  operating results and cash flows will be adversely affected 
there are significant risks related to any business combination 
hyperion has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  mergers with  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
there are risks involved in these activities  including but not limited to the possibility that hyperion pays more than the value it derives from the acquisition  the difficulty of integrating the products  operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  the possibility that all aspects of the integration are not completed or that all of the anticipated synergies of the acquisition are not realized  difficulties in managing software development activities to define a combined product roadmap  ensuring timely development of new products  timely release of new products to market  and the development of efficient integration and migration processes and tools  the difficulty of retaining key alliances on attractive terms with partners and suppliers  the difficulty of retaining and recruiting key personnel and maintaining employee morale  the potential product liability associated with selling the acquired company s products  the potential disruption of hyperion s ongoing business and the distraction of management from hyperion s business  and the potential write down of impaired goodwill and intangible and other assets 
in particular  hyperion recorded approximately million of goodwill related to the acquisition of brio that will not be amortized in the ordinary course of business 
to the extent that the business acquired in that transaction primarily the performance suite products does not remain competitive  some or all of the goodwill related to that acquisition could be charged against future earnings 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on hyperion s business  results of operations or financial position  especially in the case of a large acquisition 
hyperion is subject to the possibility of infringement claims 
hyperion expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in hyperion s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
hyperion has in the past been subjected to patent infringement claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and may require the payment of substantial amounts of money 
in the event of a successful product infringement claim against hyperion  and hyperion s failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  hyperion s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents enforcement of hyperion s intellectual property rights may be difficult 
hyperion relies primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect hyperion s proprietary rights 
hyperion s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and could be subject to challenge  such as the reexamination of one of our patents by the united states patent and trademark office 
hyperion s stock price may be volatile 
the market price of hyperion s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations 
the market price of hyperion s common stock may be significantly affected by such factors as the announcement of new products  product enhancements or technological innovation by hyperion or hyperion s competitors  announcements of acquisitions by hyperion  changes in hyperion s or hyperion s competitors results of operations  changes in revenue  revenue growth rates and revenue mix  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
technology stocks have experienced wide fluctuations in prices  which sometimes have been unrelated to their operating performance 
the market price of hyperion s common stock could be adversely affected by such fluctuations 
hyperion is dependent upon indirect channel partners 
in addition to its direct sales force  hyperion relies on indirect channel partners such as oems  vars and distributors for licensing and support of its products in the united states and internationally 
license revenue from channel partners comprised of hyperion s total license revenue for fiscal indirect channel sales involve a number of special risks  including hyperion s lack of control over the delivery of its products to end users  hyperion s resellers and distributors may terminate their relationship with hyperion on short notice  and hyperion s resellers and distributors may market and distribute competing products 
hyperion s current indirect channel partners may not elect  or be able  to market or support hyperion s products effectively or be able to release their products embedded with hyperion products in a timely manner 
hyperion may not be able to effectively manage conflicts between its various indirect channel and direct customers  and economic conditions or industry demand may adversely affect indirect channel partners or indirect channel partners may devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
revenues derived from indirect channel partners may fluctuate significantly in subsequent periods 
hyperion s most significant channel partner is ibm corporation 
hyperion signed an oem agreement with ibm in september this agreement can be terminated by ibm on days notice anytime after september  and by hyperion on days notice anytime after december  if this agreement is terminated by either party  our revenues  operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 
hyperion is exposed to product liability claims 
hyperion s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit hyperion s exposure to potential product liability claims  and hyperion carries insurance to protect against such claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in hyperion s license agreements may not be effective as a result of us or foreign laws or ordinances or because of judicial decisions  and that liability insurance may not be available  or that coverage for specific claims may be denied 
although hyperion has not experienced any material product liability claims to date  the sale and support of business performance management products by hyperion entails the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability claim brought against hyperion could have a material adverse effect upon hyperion s business  operating results and financial condition 
defects in hyperion s products could increase its costs  adversely affect its reputation  diminish demand for its products and hurt its operating results 
as a result of their complexity  hyperion s software products may contain undetected errors or viruses 
errors in new products or product enhancements might not be detected until after initiating commercial shipments  which could result in additional costs  delays  possible damage to hyperion s reputation and could cause diminished demand for hyperion s products 
this could lead to customer dissatisfaction and reduce the opportunity to renew maintenance or sell new licenses 

table of contents employee turnover could adversely impact revenue  costs and productivity 
as employees leave hyperion  it suffers loss of productivity while new employees are hired  or promoted into vacant positions 
there are also costs of recruiting and re locating new employees 
new employees must learn the hyperion organization  products and procedures 
promoted employees must learn new skills 
all of this takes time  reduces productivity and increases cost 
the potential adverse impact of employee turnover is greater for situations involving senior positions in the company 
turnover rates tend to increase as economic conditions improve 
if turnover increases  the adverse impacts of turnover could materially affect hyperion s costs  productivity or ability to respond quickly to the competitive environment 
some provisions in hyperion s charter documents and its stockholder rights plan may prevent or deter an acquisition of hyperion 
some of the provisions in hyperion s charter documents may deter or prevent certain corporate actions  such as a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could affect the market value of hyperion s securities 
these provisions include hyperion s board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with any rights it may determine 
consequently  hyperion s board of directors may issue preferred stock  without shareholder approval  that has rights superior to the outstanding hyperion common stock  hyperion s board of directors is classified into three groups  with each group of directors holding office for three years 
the effect of this classified board is that two annual meetings  not one  are required to replace a majority of the board of directors  hyperion stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes for directors  and special meetings of hyperion stockholders may be called only by hyperion s president or by the president or secretary upon written request by a majority of the board of directors and may not be called by hyperion s stockholders 
hyperion has in place a stockholder rights plan that is designed to discourage coercive takeover offers 
in general  hyperion s stockholder rights plan makes it uneconomic for any person to acquire more than a interest in hyperion without the consent of the hyperion board of directors 
hyperion s board of directors could utilize the provisions of its charter documents and stockholder rights plan to resist an offer from a third party to acquire hyperion  including an offer to acquire hyperion common stock at a premium to its trading price or an offer that is otherwise considered favorable by hyperion stockholders 
if requirements relating to the accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  hyperion s earnings may be adversely affected and we may be forced to change our employee compensation and benefits practices 
we currently account for the issuance of stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  under which we generally do not record compensation expense related to employee stock options 
on march   the financial accounting standards board issued an exposure draft of a proposed accounting standard that would require public companies to report compensation expense related to stock options and other forms of stock based compensation based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant dates 
the final standard is expected to be issued in the fourth calendar quarter of and could be effective beginning in our fiscal year if the proposed standard is adopted in its current form  our earnings will be negatively impacted 
also  we may consider changing our employee compensation and benefits practices in a manner that could adversely impact our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates 
failure to get approval for additional shares of common stock to be granted as employee stock options or restricted stock could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
we are seeking to obtain stockholder approval for additional shares of common stock that could be granted as employee stock options or restricted stock to our employees and directors 
we may not be able to secure approval for these additional shares 
if we do not get such approval  we will be forced to curtail our option issuance  which will adversely impact our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields  without significant risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of high quality  liquid securities 
at june  and june   our short term investments consisted of investment grade debt securities with fair values totaling million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of us government and agency obligations and state and municipal bonds 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the euro and british pound 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from non functional currency denominated trade accounts receivable and intercompany receivables 
intercompany receivables arise when software royalty fees and certain other costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary  which is generally their local currency 
from time to time  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of these trade receivables and certain intercompany receivables for which we anticipate settlement in the foreseeable future 
as a result  increases or decreases in these accounts due to foreign exchange rate changes are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency balances and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in our consolidated statements of operations 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were not material for fiscal  and at june  and june   we had net forward contracts to sell us dollar equivalent of million and million  respectively  in foreign currency 
an immediate change in currency exchange rates affecting these contracts would not have a material impact on our results of operations
