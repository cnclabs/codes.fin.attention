these forward looking statements are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to changes in general economic and financial market conditions  the corporation s ability to effectively carry out its business plans  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements  changes in competitive conditions and continuing consolidation of the financial services industry 
although management believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  actual results could differ materially

the corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
effective december   the corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of pittsburgh financial corporation pfc 
in addition  the corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of strategic capital concepts  inc scc and strategic financial advisors  inc 
sfa  effective march  as required under the purchase method of accounting  the results of pfc  scc and sfa have been included in the corporation s financial statements since their respective acquisition dates 
in october  sfa was merged into scc and the name was changed to first commonwealth financial advisors  inc financial statement amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the presentation format used in the reclassifications had no effect on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and significant estimates the corporation considers accounting policies and estimates to be critical to reported financial results if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and the different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or the changes in the accounting estimates from period to period could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations 
accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses are considered to be critical because they are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates by management 
the allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense  which represents management s best estimate of probable losses that are inherent in the existing loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance includes amounts calculated in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended by fasb statement no 
 and amounts determined in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for contingencies 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements including a specific allowance for primary watch list classified loans  a formula allowance based on historical trends and an allowance for special circumstances 
these key elements are described in detail in the statement of accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation also maintains an unallocated allowance to cover any factors or conditions that may cause a credit loss but are not specifically identifiable and to account for imprecision 
these factors include delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio that may reduce the correlation between historical loss and delinquency statistics used to establish allocation estimates and credit losses inherent to the current portfolio 
results of operations net income was million in  an increase of million from the results of million 
this compared to million that was registered in the change in net income for the period reflected an increase in security gains compared to the corresponding period of and a gain on the sale of two branches in the period 
in addition  the effects of restructuring costs and a litigation settlement negatively impacted net income for the restructuring charges consisted principally of severance amounts paid to employees as part of the plan to consolidate the first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued multiple bank charters and develop the first commonwealth brand and identity for all of the financial services subsidiaries 
payments to retiring directors as part of the realignment for the corporation s new vision on corporate governance were also included in restructuring charges 
the litigation settlement related to a lender liability action filed in against one of the corporation s subsidiary banks and followed an adverse pre trial judgment by the trial judge on procedural grounds 
a partial recovery from insurance for the claim related to the litigation settlement was received in in addition to the restructuring and litigation expenses that were incurred during  the decrease in net income from the period to the period included a decrease in security gains

net interest income declined to million in compared to million in and million in both interest income and interest expense declined compared to levels primarily as a result of the dramatic decrease in interest rates that began in and continued through into during this unparalleled period of low interest rates  the corporation  as well as the financial services industry in general  has been challenged by margin compression  as the cost of funds has not declined in the same magnitude or at the same pace as asset yields

b income on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis  and the loan balances are included in interest earning assets 
c loan income includes net loan fees 
d average balances do not include reallocations from noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits into savings deposits which were made for regulatory purposes 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued net interest income continued earning assets yields  on a tax equivalent basis  declined basis points during to from registered in  after decreasing from in the cost of funds for dropped basis points below costs of  after decreasing basis points from costs of 
average earning assets were  million and average interest bearing liabilities were  million for  compared to  million and  million  respectively in averages were basically flat when compared to averages in both components 
interest and fees on loans declined million for compared to after declining million for compared to levels 
the decreases are primarily the result of declining yields in a lower interest rate environment 
tax equivalent loan yields fell basis points during to from after a decline of basis points during from the levels 
installment loan yields fell basis points and the yields on home equity lines of credit declined basis points compared to the prior year 
the increase in average loan volumes was not enough to offset the reduced interest income caused by declining yields 
during  the corporation took advantage of the lower interest rate cycle and continued to change the mix of the loan portfolio 
average mortgage loans declined during as consumers refinanced their loans at near record levels 
the corporation continued to offer competitive mortgage loans but generally sold them immediately after origination along with the related servicing rights 
the corporation has recently started to retain fixed rate mortgages with maturities of years or less as well as adjustable rate mortgages 
average commercial and municipal loans offset the decline in family mortgage loans and grew million  primarily in shorter term and variable rate lending 
in addition  included increases in average installment loans of million over levels

the corporation has consistently been one of the top small business lenders in pennsylvania 
interest income on investments declined million for compared to primarily due to interest rate decreases 
interest rate decreases were also the primary cause of the decline of million in interest income on investments in compared to levels 
yields on investments for continued to decline  falling to compared to for and for as with the loan category  the increase in average investment security volumes was not enough to offset the reduced interest income caused by declining yields 
all categories of interest income on investments were negatively impacted by interest rate changes with the largest decline being registered in the us government agency category  declining million due to interest rates declining basis points for compared to this decline was partially offset by an increase of million in interest income on us first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued net interest income continued government agency securities as a result of average volume increases from to prepayment speeds of mortgage backed securities mbs continued to accelerate in as interest rates continued to decline 
interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment speeds 
as interest rates increase  prepayments tend to decline and average lives of mbs increase 
as interest rates decrease  prepayment speeds tend to increase and average lives of mbs decline  which accelerates the amount of premium amortization that is realized  further reducing the yields in current periods 
using computer simulation modeling  the corporation tests the average life and yield volatility of all mbs under various interest rate scenarios on a continuing basis to insure that volatility falls within acceptable limits 
the corporation holds no high risk securities nor does the corporation own any securities of a single issuer exceeding of shareholders equity other than us government and agency securities 
interest on deposits dropped million for compared to primarily as a result of decreases due to interest rates of million 
the corporation also registered decreases in interest expense of million due to declines in average volumes of deposits in compared to the rate on savings deposits fell basis points resulting in a decrease to interest expense of million for compared to  while the rate on time deposits for also declined  down basis points  compared to resulting in a decrease to interest expense of million 
the deposit mix changed in as clients registered a preference for savings products  which jumped million or  while time deposits dropped million or due to continued economic uncertainties 
average interest bearing demand deposit balances for also advanced  up million over balances 
during its management of deposit levels and mix  the corporation continues to evaluate the cost of time deposits compared to alternative funding sources as it balances its goals of providing clients with the competitive rates they are looking for while also minimizing the corporation s cost of funds 
interest expense on short term borrowings rose thousand during primarily as a result of volume increases of million which were partially offset by rate decreases of million 
average short term borrowings rose by million for compared to while the cost of short term borrowings fell by basis points compared to the prior year 
all categories of short term borrowing costs declined from year to year 
the increase in short term borrowings is due in part to million of long term debt that matured during the fourth quarter of and was replaced with short term borrowings 
in addition  the increase in short term borrowings can be attributed to an alco strategy implemented to mitigate the risk of further declines in net interest income resulting from a low or declining interest rate environment 
the increase in short term borrowings funded the purchase of us government agency securities maturing in approximately years 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued net interest income continued interest expense on long term debt declined million for compared to the period as decreases due to volume of million were further reduced by decreases due to rate of thousand 
average long term debt for decreased by million compared to this was due in part to the million of long term debt that matured during the fourth quarter of that was replaced by short term borrowings 
long term debt includes additional subordinated debentures in the amount of million  which were issued during  bearing an adjustable interest rate based upon the three month libor and maturing in years 
the proceeds will be used by the corporation to partially fund the pending acquisition of ga financial  inc gaf 
refer to note for further discussion of subordinated debentures that are included in long term debt 
net interest margin net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets declined to for  a decrease of basis points compared to the year to year decrease in the margin was due to asset yields declining more quickly than the cost of funds as interest rates fell to historic lows 
continued pressure on net interest income is anticipated by the corporation  despite active management of interest rate risk 
the corporation s use of computer simulation to manage interest rate risk is described in the interest sensitivity section of this discussion 
the following table shows the effect of changes in volumes and rates on interest income and interest expense analysis of year to year changes in net interest income dollar amounts in thousands change from change from total change change due to volume change due to rate total change change due to volume change due to rate interest earning assets time deposits with banks securities federal funds sold loans total interest income interest bearing liabilities deposits short term borrowings long term debt total interest expense net interest income changes in interest income or expense not arising solely as a result of volume or rate variances are allocated to rate variances due to interest sensitivity of consolidated assets and liabilities 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses is an amount added to the allowance against which credit losses are charged 
the amount of the provision is determined by management based upon its assessment of the size and quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance in relation to the risks inherent within the loan portfolio 
the provision for credit losses was million in compared to million in and million in the allowance for credit losses was million at december   which represents a ratio of of average loans outstanding  slightly up from the reported at december  net charge offs for rose million over levels 
the most significant components of this year to year change were increases in net charge offs in the following categories commercial loans not secured by real estate up thousand  loans secured by family real estate up million and construction loans up thousand 
these increases in net charge offs were partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans of thousand  loans to individuals of thousand and lease financing receivables of thousand 
net charge offs as a percent of average loans outstanding at december  were compared to and at december  and  respectively

first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued the following table presents an analysis of the consolidated allowance for credit losses for the five years ended december  dollar amounts in thousands summary of loan loss experience loans outstanding at end of year average loans outstanding allowance for credit losses balance  beginning of year addition as a result of acquisition loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural loans to individuals real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential lease financing receivables total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural loans to individuals real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential lease financing receivables total recoveries net loans charged off provision charged to expense balance  end of year ratios net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued noninterest income net securities gains increased million during to million from the thousand reported in and compared to million in the securities gains during the period resulted primarily from the sales of pennsylvania bank stocks with book values of million and fixed rate corporate bonds classified as securities available for sale with book values of million 
the corporate bonds sold during had an average remaining life of one year  and the proceeds were reinvested in adjustable rate trust preferred securities with maturities of years and mortgage backed securities with an average life of years 
this reinvestment strategy was initiated to partially mitigate the corporation s exposure to low and declining interest rates 
the securities gains during resulted primarily from the sales of pennsylvania bank stocks  us treasury securities and fixed rate corporate bonds classified as securities available for sale with book values of million  million and million  respectively 
the securities gains during resulted primarily from the sales of fixed rate corporate bonds classified as available for sale and pennsylvania bank stocks with book values of million and million  respectively

the corporation s continued success in building relationships with commercial clients provides fee based affiliates with additional sales opportunities through the total solutions financial management tsfm process 
this strategy combines products  services and professional staff from the corporation s trust  insurance  financial advisory and banking affiliates and partners them in providing comprehensive financial services offerings 
service charges on deposits are the most significant component of noninterest income and increased million for compared to increases in nonsufficient funds fees nsf of million helped to pace the year to year rise 
nsf charges were partially offset by decreases in account maintenance fees on deposit accounts of thousand compared to levels 
standardization of service fee routines accomplished during conversion of the corporation s deposit system during and added emphasis on collection of fees had positive effects on fee revenue for and management strives to implement reasonable fees for services and closely monitors collection of those fees

decreases in were primarily due to decreases in annuity commissions 
insurance commissions for included increases in personal lines  annuities and employee benefit plans compared to as part of the previously discussed tsfm process  the corporation s insurance subsidiary will continue to have expanded opportunities to meet the insurance needs of commercial clients 
in addition  the corporation has developed focus  a financial planning tool designed to help clients prioritize and assess their financial needs 
the focus concept results in a systematic approach covering a wide range of personal financial goals including appropriate insurance coverage 
this category should also be favorably impacted by the integration of first commonwealth financial advisors into these advisory models

other income for included an increase in interchange income of thousand 
the period included a gain related to the sale of a block of year mortgages as well as a gain from the termination of a subsidiary s defined benefit pension plan 
noninterest expense total other expenses for decreased million to million compared to million in the amount represented an increase of million compared to million reported in the decrease in other expenses for and the increase in other expenses for were primarily the result of nonrecurring charges that were incurred during for the previously described litigation settlement and corporate restructuring of million and million  respectively 
these restructuring charges resulted from the merger of the corporation s banking subsidiaries  southwest bank and first commonwealth bank  which occurred in october because of this merger  there was a consolidation of support functions with some staff positions being eliminated 
the personnel within the branches and relationship managers in first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued noninterest expense continued corporate services continued to serve in the same capacity in order to ensure a smooth transition 
also  related to the merger  the structures of all of the boards of directors and board committees for the corporation were realigned 
as a result of these activities  restructuring charges of million are reported on the income statement for the period 
ongoing savings from the restructuring were reflected in the period 
other charges incurred during as a part of the restructuring  related principally to writing off obsolete signs and supplies due to the name change under one charter and amounted to thousand 
also impacting other operating expense for the period were million of costs incurred principally in the fourth quarter of associated with development of the first commonwealth brand 
total noninterest expense as a percent of average assets was for compared to for and for employee costs were million in  representing of average assets compared to million and of average assets for employee costs for were million and of average assets 
salary costs for the period increased million compared to  while salary costs for the period increased million compared to levels 
employee benefit costs rose million for compared to and also rose million for compared to hospitalization costs continue to reflect the largest increases in employee benefit costs with increases of million or in and thousand or in the corporation strives to provide quality employee benefits while effectively managing costs 
net occupancy expense increased thousand during compared to expenses of million during and million for the period included increases in building repairs and maintenance  net rental expense and utilities compared to costs 
much of these increases were due to increased utility costs and snow removal expenses resulting from the harsh winter 
the period also included an increase in the amortization of the purchase accounting adjustments related to premises of thousand over the period 
an adjustment of thousand was taken during the period for the write off of the remaining purchase accounting adjustment for three branch offices that were closed during these branch offices were closed and their clients are served at nearby existing branch offices 
the corporation continues to actively evaluate its branch delivery network to optimize client service in existing branch offices and to continue expansion into growth markets 
the execution of these initiatives may continue to impact occupancy and other expenses in future periods 
increases in building insurance  building rental costs and building repairs and maintenance in were only partially offset by declines in most other building expense categories 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations continued noninterest expense continued furniture and equipment expenses increased thousand to million in increases were largely due to continued increases in depreciation expense 
furniture and equipment expenses of million for reflected increases of thousand over levels resulting primarily from increases in depreciation on computer software and software maintenance offset in part by reduced equipment lease expense 
the period was also impacted by a full year of depreciation as well as maintenance charges on systems that were placed in service during the later part of the systems were replacements of software that is utilized by the corporation s data processing subsidiary to process loan and deposit accounts 
the new application software has enabled the corporation s banking subsidiary to provide enhanced products and services  including internet banking 
technology advances continue to drive the ability of financial services companies to provide expanded services through traditional channels as well as nontraditional and emerging delivery systems to meet the changing needs of our clients 
outside data processing expense increased thousand for the period to million compared to million for the period and million for this category was positively impacted in by the conversion of southwest bank from outsourced processing to that provided by a subsidiary of the corporation 
this category will be unfavorably impacted by the acquisition of pfc until the systems  which are processed through an outsourced processing vendor  are converted to the systems that are provided by a subsidiary of the corporation 
these conversions are scheduled to be completed by the end of the second quarter of outside data processing costs are managed by the corporation s data processing subsidiary 
its needs are evaluated based on technology  efficiency and cost considerations 
other operating expenses decreased million to million for other operating expenses for increased million compared to million for the period included decreases in other professional fees and services  advertising  expenses related to training and seminars  telephone and loss on the sale of other assets primarily vehicles previously leased in the amounts of million  thousand  thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  compared to costs

this exciting campaign was designed to educate and build enthusiasm among current as well as potential clients and the communities we serve 
also impacting these categories were expenses incurred in the successful marketing campaign for free checking products introduced during these products are expected to have a favorable impact on deposit growth  interest expense and service charge revenue in future periods as well as providing potential add on sales of other financial products and services 
income tax expense was million during representing an increase of million above the amount of and compared to million in the corporation s effective tax rate was for compared to for and for although the effective tax rate was an increase over the rate  it was still favorable to the statutory tax rate and the effective rate 
the corporation s effective tax rate continues to be favorably impacted by tax free municipal income 
pretax income in the period was reduced by the million litigation settlement as well as the million restructuring charges 
the decline in pretax income from the period allowed the effect of nontaxable income to have a greater impact on the effective tax rate in than in aggregate contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes the corporation s contractual obligations to make future payments as of december  payments for borrowings do not include interest

the preceding table also excludes the corporation s cash obligations upon maturity of certificates of deposit whose maturities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
subordinated debentures in the amount of  thousand previously issued by pfc and due in were called and subsequently paid in full in january and are included as due within year above 
the following table summarizes the corporation s off balance sheet commitments as of december  commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used  the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
dollar amounts in thousands footnote reference amount commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit total lending related commitments commitments to extend credit include unfunded loan commitments as well as the undrawn portions of revolving and closed end lines of credit as of december  the contractual provisions of these commitments normally include fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  specific interest rates and clauses indicating that funding is contingent upon borrowers maintaining stated credit standards at the time of loan funding 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party 
in the event the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the corporation would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the corporation could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  the corporation would be entitled to seek repayment from the client 
the corporation s policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt convenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors 
in the ordinary course of business  funds are generated from deposits primary source and the maturity or repayment of earning assets  such as securities and loans 
as an additional secondary source  short term liquidity needs may be provided through the use of overnight federal funds purchased  borrowings through the use of lines available for repurchase agreements and borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  the corporation s banking subsidiary is a member of the federal home loan bank and may borrow under overnight and term borrowing arrangements 
the sale of earning assets may also provide an additional source of liquidity 
in addition to the previously described funding sources  the corporation also has the ability to access the capital markets 
liquidity risk stems from the possibility that the corporation may not be able to meet current or future financial obligations  or the corporation may become overly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the corporation maintains a liquidity risk management policy to manage this risk 
this policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity and quantifies minimum liquidity requirements based on board approved limits 
the policy also includes a liquidity contingency plan to address funding needs to maintain liquidity under a variety of business conditions 
the corporation s liquidity position is monitored by the asset liability management committee alco 
the corporation s long term liquidity source is a large core deposit base and a strong capital position 
core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long term relationship with a deposit customer 
deposits increased million in and included increases in savings and noninterest bearing demand deposits  which were partially offset by decreases in time deposits 
deposits in the amount of million were acquired with the bankpittsburgh acquisition 
noncore deposits  which are time deposits in denominations of thousand or more  represented of total deposits at december  noncore deposits decreased by million in and million in due in part to changes in public funds balances 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity continued although the corporation s primary source of funds remains traditional deposits from within the communities served by its banking subsidiary  future sources of deposits utilized could include the use of brokered time deposits offered outside the corporation s traditional market area

most notable were increases in commercial loans secured by real estate of million and increases in residential loans secured by real estate of million compared to year end net loans in the amount of million were acquired with the bankpittsburgh acquisition 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity continued below is a schedule of loans by classification for the five years ended december  loans by classification dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial  agricultural and other real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential loans to individuals net leases gross loans and leases unearned income total loans and leases net of unearned income an additional source of liquidity is marketable securities that the corporation holds in its investment portfolio 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale 
while the corporation does not have specific intentions to sell these securities  they have been designated as available for sale because they may be sold for the purpose of obtaining future liquidity  for management of interest rate risk or as part of the implementation of tax management strategies 
as of december   securities available for sale had an amortized cost of  million and an approximate fair value of  million 
gross unrealized gains were million and gross unrealized losses were million 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity continued based upon the corporation s historical ability to fund liquidity needs from other sources  the current available for sale portfolio is deemed more than adequate  as the corporation does not anticipate a need to liquidate the investments until maturity

interest sensitivity market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates or equity prices 
the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results principally from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  changes in the relationship of rate indices and the potential exercise of freestanding or embedded options 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances 
while no single number can accurately describe the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps  when measured over a variety of time periods  can be informative 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest sensitivity continued an asset or liability is considered to be interest sensitive if the rate it yields or bears is subject to change within a predetermined time period 
if interest sensitive assets isa exceed interest sensitive liabilities isl during a prescribed time period  a positive gap results 
conversely  when isl exceeds isa during a time period  a negative gap results 
the cumulative gap at the day repricing period was negative in the amount of million or of total assets at december  a positive gap tends to indicate that earnings will be impacted favorably if interest rates rise during the period and negatively when interest rates fall during the time period 
a negative gap tends to indicate that earnings will be affected inversely to interest rate changes 
in other words  as interest rates fall  a negative gap should tend to produce a positive effect on earnings and when interest rates rise  a negative gap should tend to affect earnings negatively 
the primary components of isa include adjustable rate loans and investments  loan repayments  investment maturities and money market investments 
the primary components of isl include maturing certificates of deposit  money market deposits  savings deposits  now accounts and short term borrowings

this is exemplified as the gap analysis shows the corporation s earnings to be negatively impacted by rising rates  but computer modeling indicates that rising rates would have a favorable impact on earnings 
therefore  to more precisely measure the impact of interest rate changes on the corporation s net interest income  management simulates the potential effects of changing interest rates through computer modeling 
the income simulation model used by the corporation captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these variables include prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  cash flows from loans  deposits and investments and balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  such as interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
the corporation is then better able to implement strategies which would include an acceleration of a deposit rate reduction or lag in a deposit rate increase 
the repricing strategies for loans would be inversely related 
the corporation s asset liability management policy guidelines limit interest rate risk exposure for the succeeding twelve month period 
simulations are prepared under the base case where interest rates remain flat  and most likely case where interest rates are defined using projections of economic factors 
additional simulations are produced estimating the impact on net interest income of a basis point movement upward or downward which cannot result in more than a decline in net interest income when compared to the base case 
the analysis at december   indicated that a basis point increase in interest rates would increase net interest income by basis points above the base case scenario and a basis point decrease first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest sensitivity continued in interest rates would decrease net interest income by basis points below the base case scenario over the next twelve months 
while the basis points declining rate scenario currently exceeds the policy limit by basis points  it is recognized by the corporation that this declining rate scenario is unrealistic in the current rate environment with the federal funds rate at only 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for the identification  assessment and management of interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  capital adequacy and investment portfolio position 
the primary objective of the alco process is to ensure that the corporation s balance sheet structure maintains prudent levels of risk within the context of currently known and forecasted economic conditions and to establish strategies which provide the corporation with appropriate compensation for the assumption of those risks 
the alco attempts to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of strategies such as asset sales  asset and liability pricing and matched maturity funding 
the alco strategies are established by the corporation s senior management 
the corporation entered into an interest rate swap transaction during the third quarter of the swap has a three year maturity and involves hedging adjustable libor based commercial loans with a receive fixed and pay floating interest rate swap of million notional amount 
the purpose of the swap was to reduce the corporation s exposure to further declines in interest rates 
the alco continues to evaluate the use of additional derivative instruments to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements on the values of certain assets and liabilities 
another strategy aimed at reducing the corporation s exposure to falling interest rates was implemented during us government agency securities maturing in approximately years were purchased with short term borrowings 
the amount of this transaction averaged approximately million for the year

the corporation manages the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio through the use of prudent lending policies and procedures and monitors risk through a periodic review process provided by internal auditors  regulatory authorities and our loan review staff 
these reviews include the analysis of credit quality  diversification of industry  compliance to policies and procedures and an analysis of current economic conditions 
in the management of its credit portfolio  the corporation emphasizes the importance of the collectibility of loans and leases as well as asset and earnings diversification 
the corporation immediately recognizes as a loss all credits judged to be uncollectible and has established an allowance for credit losses that may exist in the portfolio at a point in time  but have not been specifically identified 
the corporation s written lending policy requires certain underwriting standards to be met prior to funding any loan  including requirements for credit analysis  collateral value coverage and documentation 
the principal factor used to determine potential borrowers credit worthiness is business cash flows or consumer income available to service debt payments 
secondary sources of repayment  including collateral and guarantees  are frequently obtained 
the lending policy provides limits for individual and bank committee lending authorities 
in addition to the bank loan approval process  requests for borrowing relationships which will exceed one million dollars must also be approved by the corporation s credit committee 
this committee consists of a minimum of three members of the corporation s board of directors 
the corporation has an additional level of approval for credit relationships between thousand and million 
this procedure requires approval of those credits by a committee consisting of senior lenders of the corporation 
commercial and industrial loans are generally granted to small and middle market customers for working capital  operations  expansion or asset acquisition purposes 
operating cash flows of the business enterprise are identified as the principal source of repayment  with business assets held as collateral 
collateral margins and loan terms are based upon the purpose and structure of the transaction as set forth in loan policy 
commercial real estate loans are granted for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
generally  commercial real estate loans do not exceed of the appraised value of property pledged to secure the transaction 
repayment of such loans is expected from the operations of the subject real estate and is carefully analyzed prior to approval 
real estate construction loans are granted for the purposes of constructing improvements to real property  both commercial and residential 
on site inspections are conducted by qualified individuals prior to periodic permanent project financing  which is generally committed prior to the commencement of construction financing 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued real estate loans secured by family residential housing properties are granted subject to statutory limits in effect for the bank regarding the maximum percentage of appraised value of the mortgaged property 
residential loan terms are normally established in compliance with secondary market requirements 
residential mortgage portfolio interest rate risk is controlled by secondary market sales  variable interest rate loans and balloon maturities 
loans to individuals represent financing extended to consumers for personal or household purposes  including automobile financing  education  home improvement and personal expenditures 
these loans are granted in the form of installment  credit card or revolving credit transactions 
consumer credit worthiness is evaluated on the basis of ability to repay  stability of income sources and past credit history 
the corporation maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level deemed sufficient to absorb losses which are inherent in the loan and lease portfolios at each balance sheet date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for credit losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is appropriate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the corporation s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific allowance for primary watch list classified loans  a formula allowance based on historical trends  an additional allowance for special circumstances and an unallocated allowance 
while the corporation consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology and procedure described in note accounting policies  allowance for credit loss methodologies incorporate management s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio as well as collection probabilities for problem credits 
although management considers the allowance for credit losses to be adequate based on information currently available  additional allowance for credit loss provisions may be necessary due to changes in management estimates and assumptions about asset impairment  information about borrowers that indicate changes in the expected future cash flows or changes in economic conditions 
the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses are significant elements of the corporation s financial statements  therefore management periodically reviews the processes and procedures utilized in determining the allowance for credit losses to identify potential enhancements to these processes including development of additional management information systems to ensure that all relevant factors are appropriately considered in the allowance analysis 
in addition  the corporation maintains a system of internal controls which are independently monitored and tested by internal audit and loan review staff to ensure that the loss estimation model is maintained in accordance with internal policies and procedures as well as generally accepted accounting principals 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued since all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for credit losses is restricted to any individual credit or groups of credits  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all credit losses 
for analytical purposes  the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for credit losses at december according to the categories indicated 
management feels the unallocated portion of the reserve is necessary due to the uncertain economic and geo political environment and its impact on a variety of sectors such as health care and lodging 
during  the unallocated allowance was reduced due to an additional allocation to fourteen commercial loans 
the increase in allocations to the commercial  industrial  financial  agricultural and real estate commercial portfolios resulted from an increase in loan volumes in these categories and the bankpittsburgh acquisition within the metropolitan pittsburgh market 
allocation of the allowance for credit losses dollar amounts in thousands commercial  industrial  financial  agricultural and other real estate construction real estate commercial real estate residential loans to individuals lease financing receivables unallocated total allowance as percentage of average total loans while the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average total loans outstanding increased from in to in  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of actual loans outstanding remained at for both periods 
the allowance as a percentage of average total loans outstanding for was impacted by the inclusion of bankpittsburgh loans since the acquisition 
other than those described below  there are no material credits that management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the following table identifies nonperforming loans at december a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
renegotiated loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower

nonperforming loan levels at december  decreased million compared to levels as nonaccrual loans and past due loans decreased by million and million  respectively 
the decrease in nonaccrual loans was due to eight commercial loans that paid in full or were charged down and or charged off 
the largest improvement was related to a credit with a balance of million at december  and bearing an guaranty of a us government agency 
the credit was resolved in the fourth quarter of without any additional charge off being recorded 
a second credit  which was million at year end  continues to be resolved through the liquidation of collateral and exercising other remedies 
the balance outstanding at december  for this credit was million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
while the final resolution of this credit is uncertain  management s estimate of the potential loss on this credit is reserved 
the decrease in past due loans for the period included decreases in all major categories with the most significant decreases in loans secured by residential real estate down million  loans secured by commercial real estate down thousand and other commercial loans down thousand 
the decrease in past due loans was due to successful collection strategies 
the renegotiated loan category at december   included the one credit that was outstanding at the end of december  interest income on nonaccrual loans increased for due to final resolution of several large credits that included collection of some interest income 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit review continued the corporation s loan portfolio continues to be monitored by senior management to identify potential portfolio risks and detect potential credit deterioration in the early stages 
the corporation has a watch list committee which includes credit workout officers of the bank and meets bi weekly to review watch list credits for workout progress or deterioration 
loan loss adequacy and the status of significant nonperforming credits are monitored on a quarterly basis by a committee made up of senior officers of the bank and parent company 
these committees were established to provide additional internal monitoring and analysis in addition to that provided by the credit committees of the bank and parent company 
credit risk is mitigated during the loan origination process through the use of sound underwriting policies and collateral requirements and its previously described committee structure 
management also attempts to minimize loan losses by analyzing and modifying collection techniques on a periodic basis 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
capital resources equity capital stood at million at december   a million rise compared to december  dividends declared reduced equity by million during as dividends were increased over levels 
the retained net income of million remained in permanent capital to fund future growth and expansion 
long term debt payments and fair value adjustment to unearned esop shares in increased equity by million 
the market value adjustment to securities available for sale decreased equity by million in amounts paid to fund the discount on reinvested dividends reduced equity by thousand 
proceeds from the issuance of treasury shares to provide for stock options exercised increased equity by million during  while the tax benefit related to the stock options increased equity by thousand 
equity capital in was also impacted by the issuance of stock related to acquisitions from and  which resulted in increases in the amounts of million and thousand  respectively 
a capital base can be considered adequate when it enables the corporation to intermediate funds responsibly and provide related services while protecting against future uncertainties 
the evaluation of capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  earnings history and prospects  internal controls and management caliber 
in consideration of these factors  management s primary emphasis with respect to the corporation s capital position is to maintain an adequate and stable ratio of equity to assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of regulatory capital guidelines and the corporation s capital ratios relative to these measurement standards 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk management in the normal course of business the corporation assumes various types of risk 
the corporation has identified twenty six standard risks which have been summarized into seven major risk categories 
the seven major risk categories include credit risk  market risk  liquidity risk  compliance legal risk  operational risk  reputation risk and strategic risk 
credit risk  market risk and liquidity risk are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
the remaining major risk categories are defined as follows compliance legal risk the risk arising from violations of  or noncompliance with laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  or ethical standards  operational risk threat created by inadequate information systems  operational problems  weak internal control systems  fraud  or any other unforeseen catastrophes  reputation risk the risk to earnings or capital arising from negative public opinion  and strategic risk the risk arising from adverse business decisions or improper implementation of those decisions 
these factors and others could impact the corporation s business  financial condition and results of operation 
corporate management has taken strong and wide ranging actions to enhance the awareness of and proactively manage risk within the corporation 
in addition to establishing a comprehensive policy and procedure manual that is updated and regularly communicated throughout the corporation  the senior vice president  risk management  an executive officer level position  oversees all aspects of the risk process 
our committee structure embraces a risk management culture  which begins with the risk committee that provides oversight and monitoring of key risk areas 
the risk committee  which is chaired by the senior vice president  risk management  and has representation from all of the disciplines across the organization  meets to discuss and assess current and emerging risks as well as to identify solutions and mitigants 
credit quality and loan loss adequacy issues are addressed by the credit quality  watch list and loan loss reserve committees 
additional committees include security  which is responsible for coordinating the security program  privacy  which focuses on safeguarding client information  alco  which monitors interest rate and liquidity risks  and disclosure  which evaluates internal controls regarding information utilized in certain regulatory reports  as well as reviewing those reports and the disclosure process to ensure that disclosures are timely  complete and accurate 
the risk department has specific procedures to analyze and quantify risks in the seven major risk categories 
gaps between inherent risks and mitigants are quantified and presented to the risk committee for their review 
management continually reviews the mitigants and controls to ensure their continuity 
the internal audit department validates the existence and effectiveness of the controls 
risk gaps are compiled to develop a risk rating  which is incorporated into the balanced scorecard measure and is reported to the board of directors 
an analytical review of first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk management continued key indicators  both monetary and nonmonetary  as well as other current information that may become available through discussions with management serves as an early warning system to detect potential deteriorating internal controls 
all significant new initiatives and products are subject to a risk assessment prior to being presented for implementation 
an annual assessment of risk is also performed to identify potential threat areas to our computer systems 
our internal audit staff performs routine and consistent information technology reviews of identified risk areas  security measures and control processes 
with these processes in place the corporation believes that its objective of establishing a risk culture that identifies  measures  controls and monitors events or actions that may adversely affect our organization has been achieved 
our goal is not to eliminate risk but to understand fully the risk the corporation is assuming and appropriately manage those risks 
inflation and changing prices management is aware of the impact inflation has on interest rates and therefore  the impact it can have on a bank s performance 
the ability of a financial institution to cope with inflation can only be determined by analyzing and monitoring its asset and liability structure 
the corporation monitors its asset and liability position with particular emphasis on the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to reduce the effect of inflation upon its performance 
however  it must be remembered that the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is substantially different from an industrial corporation in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  meaning that they have been or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in general price levels 
examples of monetary items include cash  loans and deposits 
nonmonetary items are those assets and liabilities which do not gain or lose purchasing power solely as a result of general price level changes 
examples of nonmonetary items are premises and equipment 
inflation can have a more direct impact on categories of noninterest expenses such as salaries and wages  supplies and employee benefit costs 
these expenses are very closely monitored by management for both the effects of inflation and increases relating to such items as staffing levels  usage of supplies and occupancy costs
