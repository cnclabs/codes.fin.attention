new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally provided by sfas additionally  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transitional requirements of sfas are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the disclosure portion of this statement beginning in the fiscal quarter ended march  the application of the disclosure portion of this standard had no impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of op erations 
on april   the fasb determined that stock based compensation should be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair value of stock options 
the fasb has not as yet determined the methodology for calculating fair value and plans to issue an exposure draft and final statement in the company will continue to monitor communications on this subject from the fasb in order to determine the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december consolidation of variable interest entities fin r which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights  and accordingly whether it should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company is required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies for the first period ended after march  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an acc ounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair market value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie 
the company is evaluating the impact of applying fin r to existing arrangements and has not completed this analysis 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
provides guidance on how an entity classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
management s use of non gaap measures the company s management analyzes net sales on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis 
because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales  the company s management believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales 
constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior year s local currency sales by the current period s exchange rate 
constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows 
the calculation of growth rates on a constant currency basis is a non gaap measure and should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to sales growth calculated on a reported or gaap basis 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec recently issued guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particu lar transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies described below are areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition the company recognizes product revenue  net of discounts and rebates  when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured 
unless agreed otherwise  the company s terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss passes fob origin 
certain sales to domestic and european distributors are fob destination 
for arrangements where the company s terms state fob destination  the company records sales on this basis 
in the case of consignment inventories  revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
for most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out lifo method 
for all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out fifo method 
due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the lifo method and the fifo method is not significant 
restructuring cost estimates as a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization  the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities  involuntarily terminate employees  terminate leases  writedown assets or close duplicative facilities 
currently  these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
as additional information becomes available in future periods  the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information 
the company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary however  if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the period of t he change 
in july  the fasb issued sfas fas reconsiders all of the guidance contained in eitf this pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas is effective for the company as of january  sfas will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date  however  the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after january  legal reserve estimates the company is at times involved in legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within the company s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
a liability is recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
tax estimates the company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the u 
s and outside the us the company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the company s united states federal tax filings have been examined by the internal revenue service irs for calendar years ending prior to all differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled 
the company is currently under examination by the irs for the through calendar years 
in addition  inland revenue in the uk is conducting an audit for the through tax years 
management believes that the company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities 
these positions relate to  among others  the allocation and or recognition of income on intercompany transactions  the timing and amount of deductions and the tax treatment related to acquisitions and divestitures 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a reporting period 
allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the company s accounts receivable  amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market 
in estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers 
in estimating the allowance for customer rebates  management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customer s rebate claim  customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate 
the company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such re bate amounts 
in estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns  management considers product obsolescence  quantity on hand  future demand for the product and other market related conditions 
the company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value 
the company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists 
it is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change 
depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors  the impact to the company s financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change 
valuation of ipr d  goodwill and intangible assets when the company acquires another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between in process research and development ipr d  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible assets  and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
ipr d is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
f or ipr d  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including ipr d  of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the company estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
intangible assets consist primarily of patents  distribution agreements and other intellectual property  which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
the company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of event suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
pension plans the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments 
the company s foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the company s international operations 
the company s objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets  liabilities  net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations 
the instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with financial institutions 
the company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow 
the principal currencies the company hedges are the euro  the mexican peso and the japanese yen 
any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
bard s risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists 
in december  the company issued million of notes due these notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on december   at a redemption price equal to the principal amount 
assuming these notes are held to maturity  the market value of the notes approximates million at december
