liquidity and capital resources working capital 
we had working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december   with current ratios of to and to  respectively 
the increase of million was primarily due to the improved cash position resulting primarily from an increase in net earnings  a lower inventory position and higher payables to vendors 
we purchase large quantities of manufacturers close outs and direct imports  particularly in footwear and apparel merchandise categories

this can result in increased inventory levels and lower inventory turnover  thereby increasing our working capital requirements and related carrying costs
