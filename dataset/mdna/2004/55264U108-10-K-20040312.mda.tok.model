interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can come in a variety of forms  including repricing risk  yield curve risk  basis risk  and prepayment risk 
we experience repricing risk when the change in the average yield of either our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities is more sensitive than the other to market changes in market interest rates 
such a change in sensitivity could reflect a number of possible mismatches in the repricing opportunities of our assets and liabilities 
in the event that yields on our assets and liabilities do adjust to changes in market rates to the same extent  we may still be exposed to yield curve risk 
yield curve risk reflects the possibility the changes in the shape of the yield curve could have different effects on our assets and liabilities 
variable  or floating rate  assets and liabilities that reprice at similar times and have base rates of similar maturity may still be involved in interest rate risk 
if financial instruments have different base rates  we are subject to basis risk reflecting the possibility that the spread from those base rates will deviate 
we hold mortgage related investments  including mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
prepayment risk is associated with mortgage related investments and results from homeowners ability to pay off their mortgage loans prior to maturity 
we limit this risk by restricting the types of mortgage backed securities we may own to those with limited average life changes under certain interest rate shock scenarios  or securities with embedded prepayment penalties 
we also limit the fixed rate mortgage loans held with maturities greater than five years 
measuring interest rate risk 
as noted above  interest rate risk can be measured by analyzing the extent to which the repricing of assets and liabilities are mismatched to create an interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  therefore  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap position would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined based on the earlier of the term to repricing or the term to repayment of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  based on contractual maturities and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be reinvested and or repriced because of contractual amortization and rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
loan and investment securities contractual maturities and amortization reflect modest prepayment assumptions 
while now  money market and savings deposit accounts have adjustable rates  it is assumed that the interest rates on these accounts will not adjust immediately to changes in other interest rates 
therefore  the information in the table is calculated assuming that now  money market and savings deposits will reprice as follows  and  respectively  in the first three months    and  respectively  in the next nine months  and  and  respectively  after one year dollars in thousands time to maturity or repricing days days years over years total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities available for sale loans held for sale loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now and money market deposit accounts savings deposits time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings junior subordinated notes issued to capital trusts total interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl cumulative gap gap rsa rsl rsa total assets rsl total assets gap total assets gap rsa certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
therefore  we do not rely solely on a gap analysis to manage our interest rate risk  but rather we use what we believe to be the more reliable simulation model relating to changes in net interest income 
based on simulation modeling at december  and  our net interest income would change over a one year time period due to changes in interest rates as follows dollars in thousands change in net interest income over one year horizon changes in at december  at december  levels of interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change our simulations assume the following changes in interest rates are immediate 
changes in net interest income between december  and december  reflect changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  related interest rates  repricing frequencies  and the fixed or variable characteristics of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the table above does not show an analysis of decreases of more than basis points due to the low level of current market interest rates
