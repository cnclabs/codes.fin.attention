table of contents million in to million in  a increase 
our maintenance revenues increased from million in to million in  a increase 
while increasing our revenues  we maintained our focus on profitability in we decreased our operating expenses from million in to million in  while also lowering our cost of revenues from million to million over the same period

critical accounting estimates and assumptions our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
a number of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by our management  and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in applying these policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  management s observation of trends in the industry  information provided by our clients and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  doubtful accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets and other contingent liabilities 
actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenues consist primarily of software license revenues  maintenance revenues  and professional and outsourcing services revenues 
we apply the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop to all software transactions 
we recognize revenues from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our products generally do not require significant modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine and is not essential to the functionality of the product 
we use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement for the majority of our transactions 
delivery occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point 
although our arrangements generally do not have acceptance provisions  if such provisions are included in the arrangement  then delivery occurs at acceptance 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms 
collection is assessed based on several factors  including past transaction history with the client and the creditworthiness of the client 
the arrangements 
table of contents for software licenses are generally sold with maintenance and professional services 
we allocate revenue to the delivered components  normally the license component  using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the total contract value is attributed first to the maintenance and support arrangement based on the fair value  which is derived from renewal rates 
fair value of the professional services is based upon stand alone sales of those services 
professional services are generally billed at an hourly rate plus out of pocket expenses 
professional services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
outsourcing services revenues  which are based on a monthly fee or transaction based  are recognized as the services are performed 
we occasionally enter into software license agreements requiring significant customization or fixed fee professional service arrangements 
we account for these arrangements in accordance with the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of hours incurred to expected total hours  accordingly we must estimate the costs to complete the arrangement utilizing an estimate of man hours remaining 
due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is at least reasonably possible that completion costs may be revised 
such revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
due to the complexity of some software license agreements  we routinely apply judgments to the application of software recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
different judgments and or different contract structures could have led to different accounting conclusions  which could have a material effect on our reported quarterly results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical bad debt experience 
in addition  management analyzes client accounts  client concentrations  client creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our clients payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
such estimates require significant judgment on the part of our management 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates or changes in the financial condition of our clients could result in a different required allowance  which could have a material effect on our reported results of operations 
long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we must test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired using reporting units identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment  we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  considering a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and product development cycles 
differing estimates and assumptions as to any of the factors described above could result in a materially different impairment charge and thus materially different results of operations 

table of contents acquisition accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we must allocate the purchase price to the assets we acquire  such as net tangible assets  completed technology  in process research and development ipr d  client contracts  other identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
we apply significant judgments and estimates in determining the fair market value of the assets acquired and their useful lives 
for example  we have determined the fair value of existing client contracts based on the discounted estimated net future cash flows from such client contracts existing at the date of acquisition and the fair value of the completed technology based on the discounted estimated future cash flows from the product sales of such completed technology 
while actual results during the years ended december  and were consistent with our estimated cash flows and we did not incur any impairment charges in or  different estimates and assumptions in valuing acquired assets could yield materially different results 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate whether deferred tax assets are realizable and assess whether there is a need for additional valuation allowances 
such estimates require significant judgment on the part of our management 
in addition  we evaluate the need to provide additional tax provisions for adjustments proposed by taxing authorities 
marketable securities we classify our entire investment portfolio  consisting of corporate equities and debt securities issued by federal government agencies  state and local governments of the united states and corporations  as available for sale securities 
carrying amounts approximate fair value  as estimated based on market prices and any unrealized gain or loss is recognized in stockholders equity 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than its cost and the financial health of and the business outlook for the investee  including factors in the industry and financing cash flows 
incorrect assessments could adversely affect our working capital

recent accounting pronouncements effective july   we adopted eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses accounting for arrangements with multiple revenue generating activities and applies to our non software transactions 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
this issue addresses revenue recognition for arrangements that include non software deliverables  such as hardware  that are more than incidental to the products or services as a whole 
the consensus indicates that  if the software is not essential to the functionality of the non software deliverable  the non software deliverable is excluded from the scope of sop we do not have any arrangements that include non software deliverables 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a company  at the time it issues a guarantee  to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of obligations assumed under the guarantees and warranties 
the initial recognition requirements of fin were effective for guarantees issued or modified after december   and adoption of the disclosure requirements was effective for us during the quarter ended march  the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future operating results risks relating to our business our revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly  and may continue to fluctuate significantly  from quarter to quarter historically  our revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the timing  size and nature of our individual license and service transactions  the timing of the introduction and the market acceptance of new products  product enhancements or services by us or our competitors  the relative proportions of revenues derived from license fees  maintenance  professional services and outsourcing  
table of contents the tendency of some of our clients to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter or our fiscal year in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms  changes in client budgets and decision making processes that could affect both the timing and the size of any transaction  the amount and timing of operating costs and other expenses  cancellations of maintenance and or outsourcing arrangements by our clients  changes in local  national and international regulatory requirements  changes in our personnel  and fluctuations in economic and financial market conditions 
the timing  size and nature of individual license and outsourcing transactions are important factors in our quarterly operating results 
many of the products we provide through licensing transactions are relatively complex  and licensing transactions involve a significant commitment of capital  with attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures and implementation procedures within an organization 
moreover  licensing arrangements may require coordination within an organization s various divisions and operations 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable 
our inability to close license transactions on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our quarterly revenues and operating results 
general economic and market conditions and a weakening of the financial services industry may hurt our business and results of operations our clients include a range of organizations in the financial services industry 
the success of these clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets 
in addition  we believe that fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the financial markets  which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products  could disproportionately affect demand for our products and services 
in addition  if financial services firms continue to consolidate  as they have over the past decade  there could be a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
for example  if a client merges with a firm using its own solution or another vendor s solution  it could decide to consolidate its processing on a non ss c system  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
any resulting decline in demand for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on retaining and attracting clients if we are unable to keep existing clients satisfied  sell additional products and services to existing clients or attract new clients  then our business and financial results may suffer 
a variety of factors could affect our ability to successfully retain and attract clients  including the level of demand for our products and services  the level of client spending for information technology  the level of competition from internal client solutions and from other vendors  the quality of our client service  our ability to update our products and services and develop new products and services needed by clients  our ability to understand the organization and processes of our clients  and our ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses 

table of contents we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and may face difficulties in integrating our acquisitions  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations we have made and may in the future make acquisitions of companies  products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
acquisitions could subject us to contingent or unknown liabilities  and we may have to incur debt or severance liabilities  write off investments  infrastructure costs  impaired goodwill or other assets  or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing stockholders ownership 
our success is also dependent on our ability to complete the integration of the operations of recently acquired businesses  including amicorp group s fund services business  investment advisory network and neovision hypersystems  and any businesses we acquire in the future in an efficient and effective manner 
successful integration in the rapidly changing financial services industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from these acquisitions  such as lower costs or increased revenues 
we may also realize such benefits more slowly than anticipated  due to our inability to combine operations  facilities and differing firm cultures  retain the clients or employees of acquired entities  generate market demand for new products and services  coordinate geographically dispersed operations and successfully adapt to the complexities of international operations  integrate the technical teams of these companies with our engineering organization  incorporate acquired technologies and products into our current and future product lines  and integrate the products and services of these companies with our business  where we do not have distribution  marketing or support experience for these products and services 
integration may not be smooth or successful 
the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the acquisitions may also place a significant strain on our management  administrative  operational and other resources 
to manage growth effectively  we must continue to improve our management and operational controls  enhance our reporting systems and procedures  integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations 
if we are unable to manage our growth and the related expansion in our operations from recent and future acquisitions  our business may be harmed through a decreased ability to monitor and control effectively our operations  and a decrease in the quality of work and innovation of our employees 
we may be unable to grow our business because of a lack of suitable businesses to acquire we may not identify suitable businesses to acquire or negotiate acceptable terms for acquisitions 
our growth has depended on our ability to acquire similar or complementary businesses on favorable terms 
this growth strategy is subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results  including we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms  we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers or from the possibility of the acquisition target pursuing an initial public offering of its stock  and we may find it more difficult or costly to complete acquisitions due to changes in accounting  tax  securities or other regulations 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology  our success and our ability to compete will be subject to various risks our success and ability to compete depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark law  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we have registered trademarks for many of our products and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and clients 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
these efforts may be insufficient to prevent third parties from asserting intellectual property rights in our technology 
furthermore  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information  and third parties may assert ownership rights in our proprietary technology 
we do not have any patents  and existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
others may develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology  or competitors may offer equivalent products in competition with our products  thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that our proprietary technology does not include open source software  free ware  share ware or other publicly available technology 
there are many patents in the investment management field 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that others will claim that the important technology we have developed  acquired or incorporated into our products will infringe the rights  including the patent rights  such persons may hold 
third parties also could claim that our software incorporates publicly available software and that  as a result  we must publicly disclose our source code 
because we rely on confidentiality for protection  such an event could result in a material loss of intellectual property rights 
we cannot be sure that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any patent  if issued  would provide us with any competitive advantages or would not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not adversely affect our ability to do business 
expensive and time consuming litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary rights 
we have acquired and may acquire important technology rights through our acquisitions and have often incorporated and may incorporate features of this technology across many products and services 
as a result  we are subject to the above risks and the additional risk that the seller of the technology rights may not have appropriately protected the intellectual property rights we acquired 
indemnification and other rights under applicable acquisition documents are limited in term and scope and therefore provide us with only limited protection 
in addition  we currently rely on third party licenses in providing our products and services 
if we lost such licenses or such licenses were found to infringe upon the rights of others  we would need to seek alternative means of obtaining the licensed technology to continue to provide our products or services 
our inability to replace such technology  or to replace such technology in a timely manner  could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results 
we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant costs in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
while we are not currently a party to any litigation asserting that we have violated third party intellectual property rights  we may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or as a result of an allegation that we infringe others intellectual property  including patents  trademarks and copyrights 
any parties asserting that our products or services infringe upon their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our clients against the alleged infringement 
third parties could claim that our software incorporates publicly available software and that  as a result  we must publicly disclose our source code 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  could be time consuming and expensive to resolve  adversely 
table of contents affect our sales  profitability and prospects and divert management time and attention away from our operations 
we may be required to re engineer our products or services or obtain a license of third party technologies on unfavorable terms 
we expect our gross and operating margins may fluctuate over time we expect that our gross and operating margins may fluctuate from period to period as we continue to introduce new products  experience fluctuations in the relative proportions of revenues derived from our products and services  continue to hire and acquire additional personnel and increase other expenses to support our business 
historically  we derived our revenues principally from the licensing of our products 
however  we are increasingly deriving our revenues from outsourcing and related services  which have lower profit margins 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  a fluctuation in revenues could lead to operating results differing from expectations 
we derive our revenues primarily from camra  advisorware  lms and skyline software and the provision of maintenance and professional services in support of such software to date  substantially all of our revenues have been attributable to the licensing of our camra  advisorware  lms and skyline software and the provision of maintenance and professional services in support of such software 
we expect that the revenues from these software products will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for such products and services  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition with respect to our products and services the market for financial services software and services is competitive  rapidly evolving and highly sensitive to new product and service introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants 
the market is also highly fragmented and served by numerous firms that target only local markets or specific client types 
we also face competition from information systems developed and serviced internally by the it departments of financial services firms 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  generate higher revenues and have greater name recognition 
our current or potential competitors may develop products comparable or superior to those developed by us  or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing client or regulatory requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to introduce new products and services could adversely affect our business and results of operations rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and new product and service introductions characterize the market for our products and services 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing client needs and evolving regulatory requirements 
the process of developing software products such as those offered by us is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms and technologies 
our ability to keep up with technology and business changes is subject to a number of risks  including we may find it difficult or costly to update our services and software and to develop new products and services quickly enough to meet our clients needs  
table of contents we may find it difficult or costly to make some features of our software work effectively and securely over the internet  we may find it difficult or costly to update our software and services to keep pace with business  regulatory and other developments in the industries where our clients operate  and we may be exposed to liability for security breaches that allow unauthorized persons to gain access to confidential information stored on our computers or transmitted over our network 
our failure to develop new products and services in a timely fashion or to address promptly the needs of the financial markets could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
undetected software design defects  errors or failures may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products that could seriously harm our business our software products are highly complex and sophisticated and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors or bugs may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our software products or loss of client data or require design modifications 
we cannot assure you that  despite testing by us and our clients  errors will not be found in new products  which errors could result in a delay in or an inability to achieve market acceptance and thus could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on attracting  training and retaining qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel we believe that our success is due in part to our experienced management team 
we depend in large part upon the continued contribution of our senior management and  in particular  william c 
stone  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
losing the services of one or more members of our senior management could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
mr 
stone has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships since he founded the company in we maintain no key man life insurance policies for mr 
stone or any other senior officers or managers 
our success is also dependent upon our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled technical and sales personnel 
competition for the hiring of such personnel in the software industry can be intense 
locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications  particularly in the desired geographic location and with the necessary subject matter expertise  is difficult 
our failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face challenges in maintaining and expanding our international operations our international business may be subject to a variety of other risks  including difficulties in obtaining us export licenses  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  foreign currency fluctuations  the introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  and difficulties in enforcement of third party contractual obligations and intellectual property rights 
such factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents catastrophic events may disrupt our business and hurt our results a war  terrorist attack  natural disaster or other catastrophe may adversely affect our business 
a catastrophic event could have a direct negative impact on us or an indirect impact on us by  for example  affecting our clients  the financial markets or the overall economy 
the potential for a direct impact is due primarily to our significant investment in infrastructure 
although we maintain redundant facilities and have contingency plans in place to protect against both man made and natural threats  it is impossible to fully anticipate and protect against all potential catastrophes 
a computer virus  security breach  criminal act  military action  power or communication failure  flood  severe storm or the like could lead to service interruptions and data losses for clients  disruptions to our operations  or damage to important facilities 
in addition  such an event may cause clients to cancel their agreements with us for our products or services 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
recently enacted and proposed regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs and failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could seriously harm our business recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules proposed by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq  could cause us to incur increased costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and respond to new requirements 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control for financial reporting 
we currently do not have an internal audit group and we will require significant resources and management oversight to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
as a result  management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in a timely fashion 
as we evaluate our internal controls and procedures in order to determine whether they are effective  we may determine that significant changes to such controls and procedures are necessary 
in addition  our controls and procedures may not be able to prevent other than inconsequential error or fraud in the future 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  and not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
faulty judgments  simple errors or mistakes  or the failure of our personnel to adhere to established controls and procedures may make it impossible for us to ensure that the objectives of the control system are met 
a failure of our controls and procedures to detect other than inconsequential error or fraud could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price is volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future  which could result in substantial losses for our investors the trading price of our common stock has been  and is expected to continue to be  highly volatile 
the following factors may significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to copyrights or propriety rights  conditions and trends in the financial services and software industries  
table of contents changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and general market conditions and other factors 
provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that are in your best interests our charter and bylaws contain provisions  including a staggered board of directors  that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or may discourage bids to do so 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding common stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no derivative financial instruments 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government and federal agency obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and corporate obligations 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates dollars in thousands fair value of investments as of december  maturing in investments through fixed rate investments average interest we invoice clients primarily in us dollars and in local currency in those countries in which we have branch and subsidiary operations 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time clients are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations  and therefore we believe that our potential foreign currency exchange rate exposure is not material 
the foregoing risk management discussion and the effect thereof are forward looking statements 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in global financial markets 
the analytical methods used by us to assess and minimize risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses
