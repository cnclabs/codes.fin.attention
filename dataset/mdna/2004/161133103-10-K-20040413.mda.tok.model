overview we are a specialty apparel retailer primarily focused on serving the plus size woman through three distinct brands lane bryant  fashion bug  and catherines plus sizes 
we currently represent of the women s plus size specialty retail apparel market  and are the third largest specialty apparel retailer in the united states based on store count 
through our varied plus size fashion concepts  we cater to customers from a broad range of socioeconomic  demographic  and cultural profiles 
as of january   we operated  stores in states 
the apparel industry is highly competitive and is continuously faced with new and existing competitors seeking areas of growth to expand their business 
our strategy of focusing on the growing plus size market through our three brands has allowed us to gain increased market share in the women s plus size apparel market 
americans continue to gain weight in all age groups  with an estimated of american adults being overweight and half of american women wearing size or larger 
through our three brands  we offer plus size women s apparel to all age groups  with varied fashion tastes and income levels  in multiple shopping venues 
by focusing on the plus size market  we believe that we are well positioned to meet the demands of this growing segment 
our plans are to increase our store base at our lane bryant and catherines brands through expansion into under penetrated markets  focusing primarily on strip and lifestyle center formats 
an important challenge for us will be to maintain and increase our market share through growth in our store base as well as to extend into other direct to consumer channels to reach our customers 
we are further challenged by competitors that enter into the plus size market and offer similar apparel at lower prices 
we believe that our fit initiative will differentiate us from our competitors 
the goal of this initiative is to be the fit specialists for plus size women by offering products with improved fit 
our sales performance over the last three years has been negatively affected by the general slowdown in the u 
s 
economy  reduced levels of consumer confidence  and the unstable geopolitical climate 
in addition  sales performance at our lane bryant brand during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal was negatively affected by a combination of poor customer acceptance of  and fit and quality issues with  certain of its products  and under stocking of certain basic products 
as a result  we had to maintain higher levels of promotional pricing during those periods 
we implemented a plan in fiscal to improve merchandise assortments at lane bryant  which began to show a positive impact in fiscal  with a increase in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter  following six quarters of negative comparable store sales performance 
in addition  we experienced increased unit sales and improved sales performance at lane bryant during the latter half of fiscal our challenge will be to continue improvements at lane bryant in fiscal we also expect the deflationary pricing environment to continue to impact the apparel industry 
in addition  the anticipated elimination of quota on imports in may create further downward pressure on retail prices 
in addition to our continued focus on controlling expenses  two other areas of focus for us in fiscal are maintaining control over inventories while improving gross margins at our three brands 
we estimate that our cost reduction initiative  which began in  will save us a total of approximately million of expenses on an annualized basis 
the success of this initiative enabled us to reduce operating expenses by over million in fiscal the expense savings from our cost reduction initiative coupled with other cost control related savings enabled us to offset declines in sales that we experienced in fiscal we expect to achieve the remaining million of cost savings in fiscal of the remaining million  approximately million of the savings are anticipated from efficiencies we expect to gain from the consolidation of our catherines and lane bryant distribution centers into our new white marsh distribution center  which we completed in february we offer e commerce at our catherines and lane bryant websites and plan to offer e commerce at our fashion bug website during fiscal our fiscal plan is to double our fiscal e commerce sales volume through continuing to broaden category offerings at our websites 
our e commerce sales in fiscal and our planned e commerce sales in fiscal are less than one percent of our consolidated net sales 
our websites currently offer basic merchandise  and we see opportunities to offer and provide expanded product offerings on our websites  such as intimate apparel and hard to find sizes 
this provides us opportunities to offer more merchandise categories than we are able to provide in our stores 
critical accounting policies we have prepared the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  analysis of current trends  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we periodically reevaluate our accounting policies  assumptions  and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances warrant 
historically  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  we consider the following accounting policies and related assumptions to be more critical to  and involve the most significant management judgments and estimates in  the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition our revenues from merchandise sales are net of returns and allowances and exclude sales tax 
revenues from our e commerce business include shipping and handling fees billed to customers 
we record a reserve for estimated future sales returns based on an analysis of actual returns and we defer recognition of layaway sales to the date of delivery 
a change in our actual rates of sales returns and layaway sales experience would affect the level of revenue recognized 
we offer our customers various loyalty card programs 
customers that join these programs are entitled to various benefits  including discounts and rebates on purchases during the membership period 
customers generally join these programs by paying an annual membership fee 
we recognize revenue from these loyalty programs as sales over the life of the membership period based on when the customer earns the benefits and when the fee is no longer refundable 
costs we incur in connection with administering these programs are recognized in cost of goods sold as incurred 
during fiscal  we introduced a new fashion bug customer loyalty card program that we operate under our fashion bug proprietary credit card program 
this program provides customers with the option to cancel their membership within days  entitling them to a full refund of their annual fee 
additionally  after days  customers that cancel their membership are entitled to a pro rata fee refund based on the number of months remaining on the annual membership 
accordingly  we recognize of the annual membership fee as revenue after days  with the remaining fee recognized on a pro rata basis over nine months 
under a previous fashion bug customer loyalty card program  we recognized revenues from annual membership fees as sales over the life of the membership based on discounts earned by the customer 
for customers who did not earn discounts during the membership period that exceeded the card fee  the difference between the membership fee and discounts earned was recognized as revenue upon the expiration of the annual membership period 
upon early cancellation of the loyalty card  refunds of membership fees were reduced by the amount of any discounts granted to the member under the program 
we discontinued the issuance of new cards under this program in december  and we terminated the program during the second quarter of fiscal inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market under the retail inventory method average cost basis  which is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost  and the resulting gross margins  are adjusted in proportion to markdowns and shrinkage on our retail inventories 
the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
the rim calculation involves certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markup  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
events such as store closings  liquidations  and a weak general economic environment for retail apparel sales could result in an increase in the level of markdowns 
such an increase in the level of markdowns could result in lower inventory values and increases to cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in future periods under the rim 
also  failure to properly estimate markdowns currently can result in an overstatement of inventory cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
at the end of fiscal and fiscal  in addition to markdowns that had been recorded in inventory  an additional million and million  respectively  of markdowns representing markdowns not yet taken on aged inventory was recorded in order to properly reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in connection with our restructuring plan announced on january  see results of operations  comparison of fiscal to fiscal  restructuring charge credit below  we recognized additional markdowns of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the markdowns were related to the valuation of inventory for the answer added dimensions stores that we closed during the first half of fiscal we elected to adopt the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
see accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor below as of the beginning of fiscal as of january  and february   million and million  respectively  of cash received from vendors was deferred into inventory to be recognized as inventory is sold 
impairment of long lived assets prior to fiscal  we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions related to the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
also resolved certain implementation issues related to sfas no 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used  and provides additional guidance on estimating cash flows when testing for recoverability 
sfas no 
also requires that long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale such as by abandonment be classified as held and used until disposal  and establishes more restrictive criteria for classifying assets as held for sale 
under sfas no 
 we are required to assess our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we consider historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
our estimate of fair value is generally based on either appraised value or the present value of future cash flows  based on a number of assumptions and estimates 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded a million write down of under performing assets related to our consolidated monsoon joint venture during fiscal the write down is included in occupancy expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
the amount of the write down was the same as what we would have recorded under sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in fiscal in connection with our restructuring plan announced on january  see results of operations  comparison of fiscal to fiscal  restructuring charge credit below  we recognized a write down of store fixed assets of approximately million during fiscal in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in determining these impairment charges were reasonable and appropriate 
we fully adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of the beginning of fiscal in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we performed a review of our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment 
as a result  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill related to our catherines acquisition which included the value of intangible assets we did not separately account for at the date of the catherines acquisition exceeded the estimated fair value of the goodwill under sfas no 
we determined the estimated fair value of the catherines goodwill using the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the catherines assets 
we recorded a write down  which was not deductible for income tax purposes  of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value 
the majority of the write down was attributable to the value of unrecorded trademarks 
we also evaluated our goodwill  trademarks  tradenames  and internet domain names related to our lane bryant acquisition as of february  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 and determined that there was no impairment of those assets 
we have included the write down of the catherines goodwill as the cumulative effect of an accounting change as of february  in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal our calculation of the estimated fair value of the goodwill and other intangible assets required estimates  assumptions  and judgments  and results might have been materially different if different estimates  assumptions  and judgments had been used 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used were reasonable and appropriate 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we re evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment 
we performed this annual review during the fourth quarters of fiscal and fiscal  and determined that there has been no additional impairment of these assets 
acquisitions purchase price allocation we account for acquisitions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
we assign to all identifiable assets acquired including intangible assets  and to all identifiable liabilities assumed  a portion of the cost of the acquired company equal to the estimated fair value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition 
we record the excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed  if any  as goodwill 
we make the initial purchase price allocation based on the evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined  we make appropriate adjustments to the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and make corresponding changes to the amount allocated to goodwill 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
we have  if necessary  up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 
asset securitization asset securitization is a practice commonly used in the retail industry that allows companies with proprietary credit card programs to finance credit card receivables at attractive rates 
asset securitization primarily involves the sale of proprietary credit card receivables to a special purpose entity  which in turn transfers the receivables to a trust the trust that is a qualified special purpose entity qspe and is administered by an independent trustee 
we use asset securitization to fund the credit card receivables generated by our fashion bug credit card program 
the fashion bug credit cards are issued by spirit of america national bank  one of our subsidiaries 
because the trust qualifies as a qspe  its assets and liabilities are not consolidated in our balance sheet 
investors purchase various forms of certificates or credit card receivable interests the certificates issued by the trust that represent undivided interests in the trust s underlying assets 
the trust pays to the certificate holders a portion of future scheduled cash flows from the credit card receivables under preset terms and conditions 
payments to certificate holders are dependent upon actual cash flows generated by the underlying trust assets 
we retain certain subordinated interests in each securitization transaction that effectively serve as a form of credit enhancement to the certificates sold to outside investors 
to the extent that cash flows to the trust from the credit card receivables remain available after repayment of the outside investors interests  such amounts are paid to us 
neither the investors nor the trust have recourse against us beyond the combination of trust assets and our subordinated interests  other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties  and covenants 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and related indemnities do not protect the trust or the outside investors against credit related losses on the receivables 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we record an interest in the estimated present value of cash flows we expect to receive over the period the receivables are outstanding 
these cash flows essentially represent finance charges and late fees in excess of amounts paid to certificate holders  credit losses  and service fees  and are referred to as the interest only strip i o strip 
in addition to the i o strip  we recognize a servicing liability  since the servicing fees we expect to receive from the securitizations do not provide adequate compensation for servicing the receivables 
the servicing liability represents the present value of the excess of the costs of servicing over the servicing fees we expect to receive  and is recorded at estimated fair value 
since quoted market prices are generally not available  we determine the fair value of the costs of servicing by calculating all costs associated with billing  collecting  maintaining  and providing customer service during the expected life of the securitized credit card receivable balances 
we discount the costs in excess of the servicing fees we expect to collect over the estimated life of the receivables sold 
the discount rate and estimated life assumptions used in valuing the servicing liability are equivalent to those used in valuing the i o strip 
we amortize the i o strip and the servicing liability on a straight line basis over the expected life of the credit card receivables 
we use certain key valuation assumptions related to the average life of the receivables sold  the finance charges net of interest to be earned by certificate holders  and anticipated credit losses  as well as the appropriate market discount rate in determining the estimated value of the i o strip and the servicing liability 
we estimate the values for these assumptions using historical data  the impact of the current economic environment on the performance of the receivables sold  and the impact of the potential volatility of the current market for similar instruments in assessing the fair value of the retained interests 
changes in the average life of the receivables sold  discount rate  and credit loss percentage could cause actual results to differ materially from the estimates  and changes in circumstances could result in significant future changes to the assumptions currently being used 
the following table presents the decrease in our i o strip receivable that would result from hypothetical adverse changes of and in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the i o strip in millions change change payment rate residual cash flows discount rate credit loss percentage costs associated with exit or disposal activities we have traditionally recognized certain costs associated with restructuring plans as of the date of commitment to the plan  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullified eitf issue no 
under sfas no 
 we are required to recognize liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity initiated after december  when the liabilities are incurred 
commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
under sfas no 
 we are required to recognize severance pay over time rather than up front if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period 
the liability for severance pay is recognized as employees render service over the future service period  even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service 
fair value should be used for initial measurement of liabilities under sfas no 
adoption of sfas no 
results in the deferral of recognition of certain costs for restructuring plans initiated subsequent to december   from the date of commitment to such a plan to the date that costs are incurred under the plan 
on march   we announced the implementation of a cost reduction plan see results of operations  comparison of fiscal to fiscal  expenses related to cost reduction plan below 
costs incurred in connection with the implementation of this plan are being accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor eitf issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  addresses the accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor  including both a reseller of the vendor s products and an entity that purchases the vendor s products from a reseller 
we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
as of the beginning of fiscal we recognized a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  for the cumulative effect of the deferral of cash received from vendors as of the beginning of fiscal the impact of the adoption of eitf on the year ended february  was an increase in cost of goods sold of million 
as of january  and february   million and million  respectively  of cash received from vendors has been deferred into inventory and will be recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold as inventory is sold 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  allows two alternatives for accounting for stock based compensation the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
companies electing to adopt the intrinsic value method are required to provide pro forma disclosures of the effect of adopting the fair value method 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
we recognize compensation expense for stock options and stock awards that have an exercise price less than the market price of our common stock at the date of grant of the option or award 
we measure compensation expense based on the difference between the market price and the exercise price of an option or award at the date of grant 
this compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each option or award 
we do not recognize compensation expense for options having an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant or for shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
under the fair value method  we would be required to recognize compensation expense for all stock options and stock awards 
compensation would be measured based on an estimated fair value of the option or award  using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes or binomial pricing model 
these models require estimates or assumptions as to the dividend yield and price volatility of the underlying stock  the expected life of the option or award  and a relevant risk free interest rate 
for purposes of determining our pro forma disclosures of the effect of adopting the fair value method  we use the black scholes option pricing model and various assumptions that are detailed in item financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  note summary of significant accounting policies  common stock plans below 
the use of different option pricing models and different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different estimates of compensation expense under the fair value method 
insurance liabilities we use a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for certain risks  including workers compensation  medical  dental  automobile  and general liability claims 
our insurance liabilities are a component of accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet  and represent our estimate of the ultimate cost of uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating our self insurance liabilities  we use independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analyses of historical data 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance liabilities could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
we evaluate the adequacy of these liabilities on a regular basis  modifying our assumptions as necessary  updating our records of historical experience  and adjusting our liabilities as appropriate

the following table sets forth information with respect to store activity for fiscal and planned store activity for fiscal fashion lane monsoon bug bryant catherines accessorize total fiscal stores at february  
  stores opened stores converted stores closed net changes in stores stores at january  
  stores relocated during period stores remodeled during period fiscal planned store openings planned store relocations planned store closings four fashion bug stores that were converted to lane bryant stores during fiscal were closed during fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales the decrease in net sales from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of operating stores at our fashion bug brand and the closing of our the answer added dimensions stores following our fiscal store restructuring initiative  and negative comparable store sales results at our lane bryant brand 
we operated  retail stores at the end of fiscal  as compared to  stores at the end of fiscal fashion bug stores experienced mixed results in comparable store sales during fiscal  with flat comparable store sales for the year 
the average number of transactions and average number of units sold per customer upc increased and  respectively  in our fashion bug stores  while the average dollar sale and average retail value per unit sold decreased and  respectively 
fashion bug stores experienced increases in sales of plus sportswear  accessories  intimate apparel  and footwear  which were partially offset by decreases in sales of junior sportswear and dresses 
catherines stores also experienced mixed results in comparable store sales during fiscal  with a decrease in comparable store sales for the year 
the average dollar sale and average upc each increased in our catherines stores  while the average number of transactions and average retail value per unit sold decreased and  respectively 
increased sales of denim  which performed strongly as a result of the brand s fit initiative  and intimate apparel were offset by decreases in sales of dresses  career sportswear  suits  sweaters  and hosiery 
although lane bryant stores experienced quarter over quarter improvements in comparable store sales during fiscal  they experienced an overall decrease of in comparable store sales for the year 
although the average upc increased for lane bryant stores  the average dollar sale and average retail value per unit sold decreased and respectively  reflecting the brand s higher level of promotional pricing 
the average number of transactions at lane bryant stores decreased 
for lane bryant  decreases in sales of sweaters  casual woven tops  and denim separates were partially offset by increases in sales of knit and active separates  intimate apparel  and casual woven separates 
the lane bryant brand experienced poor customer acceptance of  and fit and quality issues with  certain of its products during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal  resulting in higher levels of promotional pricing 
in addition  certain basic products were under stocked during the second half of fiscal  resulting in missed sales opportunities 
improved merchandise assortments resulted in increased unit sales and improved sales performance for the lane bryant brand during the second half of fiscal cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy the decrease in cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy expenses from fiscal to fiscal principally reflects the decrease in net sales 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was unchanged from fiscal to fiscal improvements in merchandise margins in our fashion bug brand were offset by lower merchandise margins in our lane bryant and catherines brands 
higher levels of promotional activity and poor customer acceptance of certain lane bryant products  as discussed above  also negatively affected merchandise margins in both years 
cost of goods sold for fiscal included million of costs related to the valuation of lane bryant inventories 
the million related to markdowns for inventory on hand as a result of the poor customer acceptance of  and fit and quality issues with  certain of lane bryant s products  which resulted in higher levels of promotional pricing to liquidate the product 
cost of goods sold includes merchandise costs net of discounts and allowances  freight  inventory shrinkage  and shipping and handling costs associated with our e commerce business 
net merchandise costs and freight are capitalized as inventory costs 
buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the lack of leverage on relatively fixed occupancy costs as a result of negative comparable store sales  particularly in our lane bryant brand 
occupancy expenses for fiscal included a million write down of under performing assets related to our monsoon accessorize stores 
buying expenses include payroll  payroll related costs  and operating expenses for our buying departments and warehouses 
occupancy expenses include rent  real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  utilities  maintenance  and depreciation for our stores and warehouse facilities and equipment 
buying and occupancy costs are treated as period costs and are not capitalized as part of inventory 
selling  general  and administrative the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily a result of reductions in store payroll and the realization of cost reduction initiatives  including improved management of controllable expenses see expenses related to cost reduction plan below 
selling expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal were negatively affected by costs associated with transitional service agreements related to the lane bryant acquisition 
we completed the integration of lane bryant s information systems during fiscal expenses related to cost reduction plan on march   we announced a cost reduction plan designed to take advantage of the centralization of all corporate administrative services throughout the company and to realize certain efficiencies  in order to improve profitability 
see item financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  note expenses related to cost reduction plan below for details of this program 
the cost reduction plan was substantially completed during fiscal we did not experience a material after tax cash impact from execution of this plan 
e expect this cost reduction plan to improve annualized pre tax earnings by a total of approximately million 
during fiscal  we realized cost reductions of more than million as a result of this plan 
we expect to realize the remaining benefits of the cost reduction plan by the end of fiscal expenses incurred in connection with the plan  payments settlements of those expenses for fiscal  and the remaining accrual at january   were as follows year ended accrued at january  payments january  in millions settlements workforce reduction costs lease termination and related costs 
accelerated depreciation costs non cash charge other facility closure costs total workforce reduction costs represent involuntary termination benefits and retention bonuses 
employees affected by the plan were notified during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we terminated employees in connection with workforce reductions at our corporate and divisional home offices and the closing of our memphis  tennessee distribution center  our hollywood  florida credit operations  and our remaining monsoon stores 
we accrued the severance benefit in accordance with sfas no 
and recognized retention bonuses ratably over the employees remaining service period 
lease termination and related costs mainly represent the estimated fair value of the remaining lease obligations at the hollywood  florida facility  reduced by estimated sublease income 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognized the present value of the remaining lease obligation less estimated sublease income related to the hollywood  florida facility in june when we closed the facility 
accelerated depreciation costs represent the acceleration of depreciation of the net book value of the assets at our memphis distribution center and our hollywood credit operations  which were closed in june  to their estimated net realizable values 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we made the decision to sell the memphis  tennessee distribution center  and began accelerating the depreciation of the asset to its estimated net realizable value as of its then expected cease use date of june during the third quarter of fiscal  we began to evaluate alternative uses for the facility  and began to depreciate the then current carrying amount of the asset over its estimated useful life 
other income interest expense the decrease in other income from fiscal to fiscal resulted from a million decrease in interest income 
interest income decreased as a result of a decrease in the average yield on investments during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from lower interest rates on borrowings during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense for fiscal also included a write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to a million term loan that was repaid during fiscal during fiscal  we replaced a million term loan and million of convertible subordinated notes with million of senior convertible notes see financing below 
income tax provision the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the lower effective tax rate in fiscal was due primarily to changes in previously estimated full year amounts  including our tax liability related to insurance programs 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was primarily a result of our acquisition of lane bryant in august we operated  stores at the end of fiscal  as compared to  stores at the end of fiscal had we acquired lane bryant as of the beginning of fiscal  we would have experienced an overall comparable store sales decrease of from fiscal in fiscal  lane bryant stores experienced comparable store sales decreases in sweaters  denim  and intimate apparel 
in particular  the lane bryant brand experienced poor customer acceptance of  and fit and quality issues with  certain of its products during the second half of fiscal  resulting in higher levels of promotional pricing 
in addition  certain basic products at lane bryant were under stocked  resulting in missed sales opportunities 
due to product lead times  these issues negatively affected lane bryant results into the first half of fiscal see comparison of fiscal to fiscal  net sales above 
for fashion bug stores  comparable store sales increases in junior and plus sportswear  footwear  intimate apparel  and accessories were offset by declines in other missy sportswear  dresses  and coats 
for catherines stores  comparable store sales increases in casual sportswear were offset by declines in other merchandise categories 
during fiscal  we discontinued the added dimensions brand  closed the remaining added dimensions stores  and liquidated the remaining added dimensions store inventory 
cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy cost of goods sold  buying  and occupancy expenses increased from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of the increase in net sales  but decreased as a percentage of net sales 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the higher merchandise margins reflected improved inventory management in the fashion bug and catherines brands and benefits from our restructuring plan see restructuring charge credit below  partially offset by declining margins in the lane bryant brand 
markdowns taken in connection with liquidation of added dimensions inventories during fiscal were offset by million of costs accrued at the end of fiscal related to the valuation of inventory for stores to be closed as the result of our restructuring plan 
merchandise margins for fiscal were negatively impacted by higher levels of promotional activity during the second half of the fiscal year as a result of a generally sluggish christmas holiday season and poor customer acceptance of certain lane bryant products  as discussed above 
cost of goods sold for fiscal included million of costs related to the valuation of lane bryant inventories 
the million related to markdowns for inventory on hand as a result of the poor customer acceptance of  and fit and quality issues with  certain of lane bryant s products  which resulted in higher levels of promotional pricing to liquidate the product 
cost of goods sold includes merchandise costs net of discounts and allowances  freight  inventory shrinkage  and shipping and handling costs associated with our e commerce business 
net merchandise costs and freight are capitalized as inventory costs 
buying and occupancy expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of the lack of leverage on relatively fixed occupancy costs caused by negative comparable store sales 
occupancy expenses for fiscal  as a percentage of net sales  increased from fiscal relatively higher occupancy expenses for the lane bryant stores as compared to our other brands and a million write down of under performing assets related to our monsoon accessorize stores contributed to the increase in occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales 
buying expenses increased as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal buying expenses include payroll  payroll related costs  and operating expenses for our buying departments and warehouses 
occupancy expenses include rent  real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance  utilities  maintenance  and depreciation for our stores and warehouse facilities and equipment 
buying and occupancy costs are treated as period costs and are not capitalized as part of inventory 
selling  general  and administrative the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was principally a result of the acquisition of lane bryant 
selling expenses increased as a percentage of net sales 
the increase was attributable to a number of factors  including higher store payroll and benefit costs  new point of sales systems at fashion bug  and an increase in direct marketing expenses in the catherines and lane bryant brands 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased employee benefits costs  costs associated with transitional service agreements related to the lane bryant acquisition  and the lack of leverage on fixed costs  particularly at lane bryant 
during fiscal  we completed the integration of lane bryant s information systems 
restructuring charge credit on january   we announced a restructuring plan  including a number of initiatives designed to position us for increased profitability and growth in the women s plus size apparel business 
the restructuring plan included the closing or conversion of our the answer added dimensions stores  the closing of under performing fashion bug stores  and the conversion of fashion bug store locations to lane bryant stores 
the restructuring plan resulted in a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the restructuring charge included a million non cash write down of fixed assets primarily store fixtures and improvements in the stores to be closed 
the restructuring charge also included million of anticipated payments to landlords for the early termination of existing store leases  thousand for severance costs  and thousand for sign removal and other costs 
we completed the restructuring plan and recognized a pre tax restructuring credit of million during fiscal the restructuring credit was primarily a result of our ability to negotiate lease terminations on terms more favorable than those used in our original estimates 
because a majority of the store closings occurred during the second half of fiscal  the full benefit of the restructuring plan was not realized until fiscal amortization of goodwill during fiscal  we recognized million of amortization of goodwill related to our catherines acquisition 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of february   and discontinued the amortization of the catherines goodwill 
however  the catherines goodwill  and goodwill related to our acquisition of lane bryant  are subject to periodic impairment reviews in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
see critical accounting policies  impairment of long lived assets above and cumulative effect of accounting changes below 
other income interest expense the decrease in other income from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from a million decrease in interest income 
the decrease in interest income resulted from a lower average yield on investments during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased primarily as a result of amortization of fees related to our credit facility  and to a lesser extent as a result of additional long term mortgage borrowings and acquisitions of point of sale equipment under long term capital leases 
in addition  interest expense in fiscal included a write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to a million term loan that was repaid during the period see financing below 
these increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense in fiscal as a result of relatively lower interest rates on borrowings and reduced levels of borrowings 
during fiscal  we replaced the million term loan and million of convertible subordinated notes with million of senior convertible notes see financing below 
income tax provision the effective tax rate for fiscal was  as compared to a effective tax rate for fiscal the unusual effective tax rate in fiscal resulted from the effect of a million provision related to one of our employee insurance programs on a relatively small pre tax loss 
cumulative effect of accounting changes we fully adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of february  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 we tested goodwill related to our catherines acquisition for impairment during fiscal  and recorded a write down of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its estimated fair value 
we also elected to adopt the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor as of the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect at the beginning of fiscal from deferring the recognition of cash received from vendors was a charge of million  net of income taxes of million

see impairment of long lived assets and accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor in critical accounting policies above for additional discussion of these items 
comparison of fourth quarter to fourth quarter net sales net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  a decrease of from net sales of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal overall  comparable store sales decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of fashion bug operating stores following our fiscal store restructuring initiative and a decrease in fashion bug comparable store sales 
as a result of lower levels of promotional activity in comparison to competitors in the early part of the christmas season  fashion bug stores experienced comparable store sales decreases in all major product categories except for accessories 
although the average number of units sold per customer upc at fashion bug increased  the number of transactions  average retail price per unit  and average dollars per sale decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal lane bryant stores experienced a increase in comparable store sales for the quarter  with comparable store sales increases in accessories  intimate apparel  and casual sportswear  which were partially offset by comparable store sales decreases in other product categories 
for lane bryant stores  a increase in both upc and average dollars per sale were partially offset by decreases in the average retail price per unit and the number of transactions 
catherines stores experienced flat comparable store sales for the quarter  with comparable store sales increases in casual sportswear and intimate apparel offset by decreases in other product categories

the million related to markdowns for inventory on hand as a result of the poor customer acceptance of  and fit and quality issues with  certain lane bryant products  which resulted in higher levels of promotional pricing in order to liquidate the product 
buying and occupancy expenses  expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in buying and occupancy expenses as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the lack of leverage on relatively fixed occupancy costs as a result of negative overall comparable store sales 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decrease of from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these costs decreased by in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of the realization of cost reduction initiatives  including improved management of controllable expenses see comparison of fiscal to fiscal  expenses related to cost reduction plan above

prior year amounts reflect reclassifications to conform to the current year presentation 
cash provided by operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  a decrease of million from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of a million increase in our investment in inventories  net of accounts payable 
net cash provided by operating activities also decreased as a result of a million decrease in net income before non cash charges and the cumulative effect of accounting changes  a million net change in prepaid and accrued expenses and other liabilities  and a million change in income taxes payable 
these decreases were partially offset by a million decrease in accrued restructuring costs during fiscal the increase in the net investment in inventories was primarily a result of a combination of slightly higher levels of store inventories at the end of fiscal due to lower than planned sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a one time benefit from improved vendor terms received during fiscal from conforming lane bryant s vendor terms to our corporate terms 
during fiscal  we reached a settlement with the internal revenue service regarding its audit of our corporate owned life insurance coli program see below 
the settlement resulted in a decrease in income taxes payable during fiscal that more than offset accrued taxes payable for the period 
the change in prepaid and accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily a result of the timing of certain payments 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily a result of an increase in net income before non cash charges and the cumulative effect of accounting changes 
in addition  our investment in inventories  net of accounts payable  decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of improved vendor terms from conforming lane bryant s vendor terms to our corporate terms 
these changes were partially offset by the million decrease in accrued restructuring costs during fiscal during fiscal  we reached a settlement with the internal revenue service regarding its audit of our corporate owned life insurance coli program 
the settlement included million of income taxes and million of interest  net of a tax benefit of million 
of the million of income taxes  million was satisfied through the use of existing operating losses and tax credits 
as part of the settlement  we surrendered our existing life insurance policies and received their cash surrender value of million 
the settlement had no impact on our current results of operations  as we had previously provided for taxes to cover the settlement 
the settlement had a net positive impact of approximately million on our fiscal cash flows 
the utilization of the operating losses and tax credits to satisfy income taxes related to the coli settlement resulted in a decrease in net deferred tax assets 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  these expenditures were primarily for the construction  remodeling  and fixturing of new and existing retail stores and corporate systems technology 
in addition  pursuant to a program to replace point of sale pos equipment in our fashion bug stores and  in fiscal our lane bryant stores  we acquired million  million  and million of pos equipment under capital leases in fiscal   and  respectively

the re negotiated leases were combined into a new lease with a month term and a lower interest rate 
we also acquired million and million of material handling systems and related equipment and software for our white marsh  maryland distribution center under capital leases in fiscal and  respectively

we relocated the columbus distribution center in february the lease for the columbus  ohio distribution center and a related logistics and transportation services agreement were terminated effective as of february  in accordance with early cancellation provisions of the lease and agreement 
as a result of the use of automated sorting systems and improved facility design in the white marsh facility  we were also able to consolidate our  square foot memphis  tennessee distribution center into the white marsh facility during fiscal we relocated the memphis distribution center in june we are currently evaluating alternative uses for the memphis facility 
the consolidation of the memphis distribution center into the white marsh facility was part of a cost reduction plan announced in march see results of operations  comparison of fiscal to fiscal  expenses related to cost reduction plan above and item financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  note expenses related to cost reduction plan below for details of the cost reduction plan 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these expenditures will primarily be for construction and fixturing of new stores  remodeling and fixturing of existing stores  and improvements in information technology and point of sale infrastructure 
we expect to finance these capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds and capital lease financing 
long term debt  lease  dividend  and purchase commitments at january   our commitments for future payments under our long term debt obligations  minimum lease payments under our capital leases and operating leases  and payments due under our revolving credit facility  letters of credit  long term deferred compensation plans  and purchase obligations were as follows payments due by period less one to three more than three to five than five in millions total one year years years years long term debt  including current portion capital leases operating leases revolving credit facility letters of credit stand by letters of credit long term deferred compensation 
purchase commitments total  amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt including our convertible debt through maturity and do not include any fair value adjustments  bond premiums  discounts or revolving credit facilities 
commitments under operating leases include million payable under the lane bryant master sublease with limited brands  which we have guaranteed 
we currently have a million revolving credit facility that expires on august   which provides for cash borrowings and the ability to issue up to million of letters of credit 
at january   there were no borrowings under this facility 
long term compensation consists of our non qualified deferred compensation plan and supplemental retirement plan  which are included in deferred taxes and other non current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we have developed estimates of projected payment obligations for participant planned in service distributions of the deferred compensation plan liability as of january  we have excluded million of retirement termination benefit distribution obligations as of january  from the above estimates 
this amount has been excluded because the value of the obligation and the timing of payments may vary annually due to changes in the fair value of the plan assets and or assumptions for participant retirement termination 
purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services in the ordinary course of business 
we have not paid any dividends since  and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the payment of future dividends is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings  if any  our capital requirements  financial condition and other relevant factors 
additionally  our existing credit facility and one of our agreements with limited brands restrict the payment of dividends on our common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we have formed a trust called the charming shoppes master trust to which spirit of america national bank  our credit card bank  has transferred  through a special purpose entity  its interest in credit card receivables created under our fashion bug proprietary credit card program 
we  together with the trust  have entered into various agreements under which the trust can sell  on a revolving basis  interests in these receivables for a specified term 
when the revolving period terminates  an amortization period begins during which principal payments are made to the parties with whom the trust has entered into the securitization agreement 
we securitized million and million of credit card receivables in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and had million of securitized credit card receivables outstanding as of january  we held certificates and retained interests in our securitizations of million as of the end of fiscal  which were generally subordinated in right of payment to certificates issued by the trust to third party investors 
our obligation to repurchase receivables sold to the trust is limited to those receivables that  at the time of their transfer  fail to meet the trust s eligibility standards under normal representations and warranties 
to date  our repurchases of receivables pursuant to this obligation have been insignificant 
on november   we issued million of new five year asset backed certificates in a private placement  of which million have been sold to investors as of january  the weighted average fixed interest rate on the certificates sold is 
these certificates replaced an million securitization series that matured during the fourth quarter of fiscal on january   we closed a new conduit credit card securitization facility of million that will provide additional funding of up to million for a term of up to two years  subject to an annual renewal 
as of january   no credit card receivables were funded under this facility 
subsequent to january   we sold to investors an additional million of certificates under the million facility that we were holding as a retained interest 
as of january   these certificates were included in short term available for sale securities 
to the extent that remaining certificates under the million facility are not sold  we will hold them as a retained interest 
charming shoppes receivables corp 
and charming shoppes seller  inc  our consolidated wholly owned indirect subsidiaries  are separate special purpose entities created for the securitization program 
at january   charming shoppes receivables corp 
held million of charming shoppes master trust certificates and retained interests and charming shoppes seller  inc held retained interests of million which are included in the million of short term available for sale securities we held at january  
these assets are first and foremost available to satisfy the claims of the respective creditors of these separate corporate entities  including certain claims of investors in the charming shoppes master trust 
we could be affected by certain events that would cause the trust to hold proceeds of receivables  which would otherwise be available to be paid to us with respect to our subordinated interests  within the trust as additional enhancement 
for example  if we fail or the trust fails to meet certain financial performance standards  a credit enhancement condition would occur  and the trust would be required to retain amounts otherwise payable to us 
in addition  the failure to satisfy certain financial performance standards could further cause the trust to stop using collections on trust assets to purchase new receivables  and would require such collections to be used to repay investors on a prescribed basis  as provided in the trust agreements 
if this were to occur  it could result in our having insufficient liquidity  however  we believe we would have sufficient notice to seek alternative forms of financing through other third party providers 
as of january   the trust was in compliance with all applicable financial performance standards 
amounts placed into enhancement accounts  if any  that are not required for payment to other certificate holders will be available to us at the termination of the securitization series 
we have no obligation to directly fund the enhancement account of the trust  other than for breaches of customary representations  warranties  and covenants and for customary indemnities 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and indemnities do not protect the trust or investors in the trust against credit related losses on the receivables 
the providers of the credit enhancements and trust investors have no other recourse to us 
these securitization agreements are intended to improve our overall liquidity by providing short term sources of funding 
the agreements provide that we will continue to service the credit card receivables and control credit policies 
this control allows us  absent certain adverse events  to fund continued credit card receivable growth and to provide the appropriate customer service and collection activities 
accordingly  our relationship with our credit card customers is not affected by these agreements 
see critical accounting policies  asset securitizations above  market risk below  and item financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  note asset securitization below for additional discussion of our asset securitization program

under the catherines agreement  we may be required to repurchase receivables from the third party under certain conditions relating to a change in control of the company 
under the lane bryant agreement  we may be required to repurchase receivables from the third party upon termination of the agreement

there is a pre payment penalty of of the outstanding principal 
market risk we manage our fashion bug proprietary credit card program through various operating entities that we own 
the primary activity of these entities is to service our proprietary credit card receivables portfolio  the balances of which we sell under a credit card securitization program 
under the securitization program  we can be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent that the interest rates charged to our customers vary from the rates paid on certificates issued by the trust 
the finance charges on most of our proprietary credit card accounts are billed using a floating rate index the prime lending rate  subject to a floor and limited by legal maximums 
the certificates issued under the securitization include both floating and fixed interest rate certificates 
the floating rate certificates are based on an index of either one month libor or the commercial paper rate  depending on the issuance 
consequently  we have basis risk exposure to the extent that the movement of the floating rate index on the certificates varies from the movement of the prime rate 
additionally  as of january   the floating finance charge rate on the credit cards was below the contractual floor rate  thus exposing us to interest rate risk on the portion of certificates that are funded at floating rates 
to the extent that short term interest rates were to increase by one percentage point by the end of fiscal  an increase of approximately thousand in selling  general  and administrative expenses would result 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent that there are borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  such borrowings would be exposed to variable interest rates 
an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and decrease our cash flows
