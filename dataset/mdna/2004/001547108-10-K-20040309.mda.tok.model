item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
customers ak steel s flat rolled carbon steel products are sold primarily to automotive manufacturers and to customers in the appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  consisting principally of manufacturers of home appliances  heating  ventilation and air conditioning equipment and lighting products 
hot rolled  cold rolled  and coated carbon steel products are also sold to distributors  service centers and converters who may further process these products prior to reselling them 

table of contents ak steel sells its stainless steel products primarily to customers in the automotive industry  as well as to manufacturers of food handling  chemical processing  pollution control and medical and health equipment 
electrical steels  which are iron silicon alloys with unique magnetic properties  are sold primarily to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers  electrical motors and generators  and lighting ballasts 
in conducting its steel operations  ak steel s marketing efforts are principally directed toward those customers  such as automotive manufacturers  who require the highest quality flat rolled steel with precise just in time delivery and technical support 
management believes that ak steel s enhanced product quality and delivery capabilities  and its emphasis on customer technical support and product planning  are critical factors in its ability to serve this segment of the market 
the following table sets forth the percentage of the company s net sales attributable to various markets years ended december  automotive appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction distributors  service centers and converters ak steel is a major supplier to the domestic automotive industry  including those foreign manufacturers with plants in the united states 
shipments to general motors corporation  ak steel s largest customer  accounted for approximately  and of its net sales in  and  respectively 
sales to ford motor company accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales during the same respective three year periods 
no other customer accounted for more than of net sales for any of these years 
ak steel s relationship with general motors and ford is solely that of a supplier in the ordinary course of business 
if these companies should elect to source more of their purchases of steel from other steel producers in the future  management believes that any material change in purchases would be phased in over a multi year period 
management further believes that such a decrease in sales to one or both of these companies would be offset  to a material extent  by sales to new customers and increased sales to other existing customers 
if  however  these expectations prove incorrect  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
ak steel is a party to contracts with all of its major automotive and most appliance industry customers with terms that range from one to four years 
these contracts  which are typically finalized late in the year  set forth prices to be paid for each product category during each year of their term 
except for certain stainless steel agreements  which permit increased costs for nickel  chrome and molybdenum to be passed on to the customer  most of these contracts do not permit price adjustments to reflect changes in prevailing market conditions or energy and raw material costs 
however  ak steel recently announced that it has imposed a surcharge on its carbon  stainless and electrical steel spot market sales relating to raw material and natural gas price increases and that it is seeking agreements with its contract customers to also accept such a surcharge 
approximately of ak steel s sales of flat rolled steel products in were made to contract customers with the balance of sales made in the spot market at prevailing prices at the time of sale 
raw materials the principal raw materials required for ak steel s steel manufacturing operations are iron ore  coal  coke  electricity  natural gas  oxygen  chrome  nickel  silicon  molybdenum  zinc  limestone  carbon and stainless steel scrap  and other commodity materials 
in addition  ak steel routinely purchases between and of its carbon steel slab requirements from other steel producers  located primarily outside the united states  to supplement the production from its own steelmaking facilities 
most purchases of coal  iron ore and limestone  as well as transportation services  are made at negotiated prices under annual and multi year agreements 
purchases of carbon steel slabs  carbon and stainless steel scrap  natural gas and other raw materials are made at prevailing 
table of contents market prices  which are subject to price fluctuations in accordance with supply and demand 
ak steel enters into financial instruments designated as hedges of the purchases of natural gas and certain raw materials  the prices of which may be subject to volatile fluctuations from year to year 
ak steel believes that it currently has adequate sources of supply for its raw material and energy requirements 
there currently are  however  shortages in the industry of certain key raw materials such as scrap  ferro nickel  ferro chrome  ferro silicon  ferro manganese  coal and coke  which are negatively impacting the price paid for these raw materials and which could affect their availability to ak steel in the future 
while the company is currently managing its way through these supply issues by evaluating alternative sources  changing burden requirements and substituting materials  the potential exists for future production disruptions 
research and development ak steel conducts a broad range of research and development activities aimed at improving existing products and manufacturing processes and developing new products and processes 
research and development costs incurred in  and were  and  respectively 
employees as of december   ak steel s continuing operations included approximately  employees 
approximately  employees are represented by international or independent labor unions  under various contracts that expire in the years through in the fourth quarter of  two labor agreements covering approximately employees will expire 
while no other contracts are due to expire in  the company has initiated discussions with all of the major unions representing its production workforce in an effort to modify their contracts and negotiate cost savings to improve the company s competitive position 
the company cannot determine at this time if it will be successful in negotiating any cost savings 
in the first quarter of  the national labor relations board certified the united auto workers as the collective bargaining representative for the salaried non exempt production workers at ak steel s plant in rockport  indiana 
negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement began in the third quarter of the year 
in  the national labor relations board certified the uaw as the collective bargaining representative for production and maintenance employees at ak steel s plant in coshocton  ohio 
negotiations on a contract in coshocton began in the fourth quarter of and are continuing 
ak steel s mansfield works was one of the facilities owned and operated by armco prior to its merger with ak steel on september  on september   the contract between armco and the united steelworkers of america covering hourly workers at the mansfield works expired and the represented employees were locked out 
the lock out continued until the fourth quarter of in january  the company and the uswa reached agreement on a new labor contract that expires on march  as part of the settlement  the company and the union agreed to dismiss all outstanding civil litigation against each other arising from the labor dispute and to seek national labor relations board approval for the dismissal of all related nlrb charges  which has been obtained 
competition ak steel is one of the largest steel producers in north america 
it competes with domestic and foreign flat rolled carbon  stainless and electrical steel producers both integrated steel mills and mini mills and producers of plastics  aluminum and other materials that can be used in lieu of flat rolled steels in manufactured products 
mini mills generally offer a narrower range of products than integrated steel mills but can have some competitive cost advantages as a result of their different production processes and non union work forces 
price  quality  on time delivery and customer service are the primary competitive factors and vary in relative importance according to the category of product and customer requirements 
domestic steel producers face significant competition from foreign producers who typically have lower labor costs 
in addition  many foreign steel producers are owned  controlled or  the company believes  subsidized by their governments and their decisions with respect to production and sales may be influenced more by 
table of contents political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions 
the level for us imports of foreign steel also is affected to some degree by the strength or weakness of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 
during  major foreign currencies  such as the euro  were particularly strong relative to the us dollar which increased the cost of foreign steel for us buyers 
imports of finished steel accounted for approximately of domestic steel market demand in  in and in over the past few years  more than forty steel companies have sought relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and the industry has begun to consolidate  including the recent acquisitions by international steel group of the assets of bethlehem steel and the former ltv corporation and us steel s acquisition of the assets of national steel 
bankruptcy and consolidation has resulted in larger  more cost competitive organizations that enjoy cost advantages over ak steel resulting principally from the elimination of large portions of their pension and retiree healthcare costs and a reduced workforce 
environmental environmental matters domestic steel producers  including ak steel  are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
over the past three years  ak steel has expended the following for environmental related capital investments and environmental compliance costs years ended december  environmental related capital investments environmental compliance costs except as expressly noted below  management does not anticipate any material impact on ak steel s recurring operating costs or future profitability as a result of its compliance with current environmental regulations 
moreover  because all domestic steel producers operate under the same set of federal environmental regulations  management believes that ak steel is not competitively disadvantaged by its need to comply with these regulations 
as previously reported  the united states environmental protection agency epa published its final mact maximum achievable control technology rules for integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities in the federal register on may  pursuant to these rules  any existing affected source must have pollution control equipment necessary to comply with the mact rules installed and operating by may  the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace at the company s middletown works are affected sources subject to the new mact rules 
the company has announced that  subject to final approval of the financing terms  its board has approved the investment necessary to bring its middletown works into compliance with the mact rules 
the company is in the process of planning and preparing for the timely installation of the necessary pollution control equipment to achieve such compliance 
the company anticipates that the three year cost  primarily capital investment  of such compliance will be a total of approximately environmental remediation ak steel and its predecessors have been conducting steel manufacturing and related operations for more than years 
although their operating practices are believed to have been consistent with prevailing industry standards during this time  hazardous materials may have been released in the past at one or more operating sites  including sites that are no longer owned by ak steel 
potential remediation expenditures have been estimated for those sites where future remediation efforts are probable based on identified conditions  regulatory requirements or contractual obligations arising from the sale of a business 
pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which governs the treatment  handling and disposal of hazardous waste  the epa and authorized state environmental agencies may conduct inspections 
table of contents of rcra regulated facilities to identify areas where there have been releases of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into the environment and may order the facilities to take corrective action to remediate such releases 
ak steel s major steelmaking facilities are subject to rcra inspections by environmental regulators 
while ak steel cannot predict the future actions of these regulators  the potential exists for required corrective action at these facilities 
under authority conferred by the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  the epa and state environmental authorities have conducted site investigations at certain of ak steel s facilities  portions of which previously had been used for disposal of materials that are currently subject to regulation 
while the results of these investigations are still pending  ak steel could be directed to expend funds for remedial activities at the former disposal areas 
because of the uncertain status of these investigations  however  management cannot predict whether or when such expenditures might be required or their magnitude 
on july   ak steel received a special notice letter from the epa requesting that ak steel agree to conduct a remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs and enter into an administrative order on consent pursuant to section of cercla regarding the former hamilton plant located in new miami  ohio 
the hamilton plant is no longer an operating steel mill  having ceased operations in  and all of its former structures have been demolished and removed 
while ak steel does not believe that a site wide ri fs is necessary or appropriate at this time  in april  ak steel entered into a mutually agreed upon administrative order on consent to perform such an investigation and study of the hamilton plant site 
the company has accrued the projected cost of the study at the hamilton plant of and the study is projected to take approximately five years to complete 
environmental proceedings federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the clean water act impose categorical pretreatment limits on the concentrations of various constituents in coke plant wastewater prior to discharge into publicly owned treatment works potw 
due to concentrations of ammonia and phenol in excess of these limits in wastewater from the middletown works  ak steel  through the middletown potw  petitioned the epa for removal credits  a type of compliance exemption  based on the middletown potw s satisfactory treatment of the wastewater for ammonia and phenol 
the epa declined to review the petition on the grounds that it had not yet promulgated new sludge management rules 
ak steel thereupon sought and obtained from the united states district court for the southern district of ohio an injunction prohibiting the epa from instituting enforcement action against ak steel for noncompliance with the pretreatment limitations  pending the epa s promulgation of the applicable sludge management regulations 
although the epa has not yet promulgated the new sludge management rules  it has promulgated new pretreatment and effluent guidelines for the iron steel industry with an effective date of october  these new rules will no longer require pretreatment limitations for ammonia and phenol 
the company believes that these new rules effectively preclude an enforcement action by the epa against the company for noncompliance with the pretreatment limitations 
the company and the epa presently are negotiating to reach agreement on appropriate language for dismissal of this action 
on february   the ohio environmental protection agency oepa issued a notice of violation with respect to the zanesville works alleging noncompliance with both a order and various state regulations regarding hazardous waste management 
ak steel is continuing to work with the oepa and the ohio attorney general s office to achieve final resolution of this matter 
in addition  on october   ak steel entered into an administrative consent order with the epa region pursuant to section of the rcra 
pursuant to this consensual order  ak steel agreed to investigate certain areas of the zanesville works 
that investigation is underway 
on june   the united states filed a complaint on behalf of the epa against ak steel in the us district court for the southern district of ohio the federal action for alleged violations of the clean air act  the clean water act and the rcra 
on june   the state of ohio moved to intervene in the federal 
table of contents action 
on march   the us district court ruled that the state of ohio could conditionally intervene in the federal action 
subsequently  ohio filed a conditional complaint  which included various environmental claims  including seven air pollution claims 
on may   ak steel moved to dismiss all of ohio s claims in the federal action 
on june   ak steel also filed a verified complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the court of common pleas for butler county  ohio the state action against the state of ohio and the oepa seeking a declaration that  among other things  a ak steel is in compliance with its operating permits for the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnaces at its middletown works  which would preclude the state of ohio and the oepa from taking any action to order or enforce obligations on ak steel with respect to those facilities  and b that any emissions from the middletown works do not cause  or otherwise contribute to  a public nuisance 
on july   the court of common pleas in the state action declared null and void two notices of violation issued by the oepa upon which certain of the air pollution claims of the epa and state of ohio in the federal action were predicated 
on october   the oepa issued purported final findings and orders ff os to ak steel containing allegations that were similar to those set forth in the two original notices of violation that had been declared null and void in the state action 
at the same time  the state of ohio moved to amend its conditional complaint in the federal action to withdraw four of its air pollution claims  which were predicated on the two original notices of violation that were declared null and void 
on september   the us district court dismissed with prejudice the epa s air pollution claim  which had been predicated on the two voided notices of violation letters 
in addition  on december   the us district court stayed the remaining three air pollution claims of the oepa in the federal action pending resolution of ak steel s related administrative appeal to the ohio environmental review appeals commission erac addressing the newly issued oepa ff os 
on march   erac denied ak steel s motion to vacate the oepa s october  ff os  and in doing so ruled that oepa had sufficient evidence on which to base a finding of probable cause that ak steel s blast furnace and basic oxygen furnaces were causing a public nuisance 
on march   ak steel appealed erac s decision to the twelfth district court of appeals for the state of ohio 
this appeal is pending 
on january   the us district court granted ak steel s motion to dismiss as to six of the seven oepa air pollution claims  but denied ak steel s motion with regard to the oepa s remaining claims in the federal action 
on january   the us district court also denied ohio s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to reassert certain air pollution claims against ak steel based upon the oepa s october   ff os 
also on january   the us district court allowed the sierra club and the national resources defense council nrdc to intervene in the federal action 
their complaint is virtually identical to the complaint filed by the united states on june  on november   ak steel filed a motion to dismiss certain time barred claims and the rcra section h claim of the sierra club and nrdc 
this motion is pending 
on november   ak steel filed a motion for summary judgment on the claims of the united states  oepa  sierra club  and nrdc alleging that groundwater containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs was adding pollutants through a point source to waters of the united states in violation of the clean water act 
this motion is pending 
discovery has commenced  but no trial date has yet been set in the federal action 
ak steel is vigorously contesting all of the remaining claims 
if the plaintiffs are ever completely successful in obtaining the relief they have sought in the federal action with respect to the air pollution claims  it could result in significant penalties 
if the epa and oepa are completely successful in obtaining the relief they seek in the federal action with respect to their water and or rcra claims  it could result in substantial penalties and an order requiring ak steel to investigate and remediate alleged pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in monroe ditch and dick s creek and or other alleged hazardous constituents at the middletown works 
at this time  ak steel is unable to estimate the cost of an adverse outcome related to the air pollution  water pollution or rcra claims 
ak steel has filed additional motions for summary judgment in the state action seeking rulings that ohio s air nuisance rule is unconstitutional  that ak steel s state issued operating permits for the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnaces operate as a shield against public nuisance allegations  and that the director of oepa acted beyond his authority in promulgating ohio s air nuisance rule 
these motions are pending 
ak steel and oepa have recently been engaged in settlement discussions related to the oepa air pollution claims which  if successful  may result in the payment of an agreed upon civil penalty and implementation of certain supplemental environmental projects 

table of contents on september   ak steel received an order from the epa under section of rcra requiring it to develop a plan for investigation of eight areas of the mansfield works that allegedly could be sources of contamination 
a site investigation began in november and is continuing 
the company has accrued the projected cost of the study at the mansfield works of approximately and the study is projected to take approximately five years to complete 
on december   ak steel entered into an agreed order with the indiana department of environmental management for alleged violations concerning certain initial air emissions tests associated with the start up of rockport works 
this order required the implementation of certain supplemental environmental projects and the payment of a five thousand eight hundred eighty dollar penalty 
the penalty has been paid and the supplemental environmental projects were completed in on april   the department of justice  on behalf of the epa  issued a notice with respect to ak steel s butler works alleging certain noncompliance issues discovered during a multi media inspection by epa region iii and the commonwealth of pennsylvania in june and august the notice alleges that ak steel failed to properly handle electric arc furnace dust in violation of rcra section a  usc a and rcra section  usc  failed to properly repair and operate refrigeration equipment in violation of section of the clean air act  usc g  did not have a proper national pollutant discharge elimination system permit for a stormwater outfall and failed to comply with certain rcra inspection and training requirements 
ak steel still is investigating these claims  but has entered into settlement discussions with the epa concerning this matter 
ak steel will vigorously contest any claims it is unable to resolve through these settlement discussions 
in addition to the foregoing matters  the company is or may be involved in proceedings with various regulatory authorities that may require the company to pay fines  comply with more rigorous standards or other requirements or incur capital and operating expenses for environmental compliance 
except to the limited extent noted above with respect to the claims in the federal action  management believes that the ultimate disposition of the foregoing proceedings will not have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

in  ak steel filed an action against sollac  sa and others in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio the patent case 
the patent case involves issues of infringement  validity and enforceability of six us patents owned by ak steel that relate to aluminized stainless steel 
on july  
table of contents the district court found certain claims of the patents were valid but that the defendants did not infringe upon these valid claims 
the court also found that certain claims of the patents were not valid for lack of enablement 
there are two additional cases in which the defendants in the patent case are asserting claims against ak steel and or the company 
those cases are sollac  sa  et al  v 
ak steel corporation in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio the us case and ugine  sa  et al 
v 
ak steel corporation in the federal court of canada the canadian case 
the canadian case presents issues of infringement  validity and disparagement related to three canadian patents owned by ak steel 
the plaintiffs in the us case allege that ak steel has unlawfully monopolized the aluminized stainless steel market 
as previously reported  on or about october   the parties entered into a settlement agreement by which all of the claims at issue in the above described cases have been resolved 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the patent case and the us case were dismissed with prejudice on november   and the canadian case was discontinued on december  in april  a class action was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio by bernard fidel and others against ak steel holding corporation and certain of its directors and officers 
the plaintiffs allege material misstatements and omissions in the company s public disclosure about its business and operations 
as previously reported  the parties have entered into a settlement agreement by which they have agreed to settle all of the claims at issue in the case 
pursuant to the terms of that agreement  the parties will stipulate to certification of the action as a class action 
the settlement of the case is conditioned upon receiving final judicial approval from the district court 
if the settlement is approved  and subject to the right of individuals to opt out of the settlement  all claims pending in the action will be dismissed with prejudice 
the company does not consider the amount of the settlement to be material and  in any event  the settlement amount is well within the limits of the company s applicable insurance 
as of december   the company is named as a defendant in approximately pending lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos 
the majority of these suits have been filed in texas on behalf of people who claim to have been exposed while visiting the premises of a former armco facility in houston that has been closed since most of these lawsuits do not include a specific dollar claim for damages and many include a number of plaintiffs and multiple defendants 
specific dollar claims for damages have been asserted in only of the pending cases  involving over  named defendants in addition to the company and a total of plaintiffs 
a total of pending cases involve claims of or less  cases involve claims between and  cases involve claims of and two cases involve claims of in all but nine pending cases  each involving a claim of or less  the amount claimed is for compensatory damages and a separate claim in an equal amount is asserted for punitive damages 
most claimants fail to allocate their alleged claims of liability among the various named defendants 
it has been the company s experience  however  that  as a result of discovery  only a small percentage of claimants ultimately identify ak steel as a defendant from whom they are actually seeking damages and most of these claims ultimately are either dismissed or settled for a small fraction of the damages initially claimed 
for example  during  the company disposed of claims with total settlement payments slightly in excess of since the beginning of  the company has disposed of a total of claims with total settlement payments of approximately and has not experienced a significant increase in the average cost of settlement during this period 
in addition  only two cases against ak steel have proceeded to trial and both cases concluded with a verdict in favor of the company 
the company intends to continue its practice of vigorously defending these cases 
based upon its present knowledge  and the factors set forth above  the company believes it is unlikely that the resolution of these claims in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
however  predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation  particularly claims alleging asbestos exposure  are subject to substantial uncertainties 
these uncertainties include the significantly variable rate at which new claims may be filed  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and the potential for enactment of legislation affecting asbestos litigation

dollars in millions  except per share and per ton amounts operations overview ak steel s continuing operations consist of seven steelmaking and finishing plants that produce flat rolled carbon steels  including premium quality coated  cold rolled and hot rolled products  and specialty stainless and electrical steels that are sold in slab  hot band  sheet and strip form 
these products are sold primarily to the domestic automotive  appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction markets  as well as to distributors  service centers and converters 
the company s continuing operations also include ak tube llc  which further finishes flat rolled carbon and stainless steel into welded steel tubing  and european trading companies that buy and sell steel and steel products 
in the third quarter of  ak tube acquired arvinmeritor s central tubing facility in columbus  indiana 
on october   the company announced a plan to sell the assets of douglas dynamics  llc  the largest north american manufacturer of snowplows and salt and sand spreaders for four wheel drive light trucks  and greens port industrial park on the houston  texas ship channel 
on april   the company completed the sale of sawhill tubular products  a manufacturer of a wide range of steel pipe and tubing products 
for all periods presented  the results of sawhill tubular  douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park are classified as discontinued operations 
the company operates in an industry that has been particularly hard hit by the recent economic downturn 
a number of steel companies  including large and small competitors  have filed for bankruptcy protection during the last several years 
nonetheless  the level of domestic competition remains high  because many of the steelmaking assets of these businesses were purchased through the bankruptcy process and are being operated by companies that are able to enjoy cost advantages resulting principally from the elimination of large portions of their predecessors retiree pension and healthcare costs and a reduced workforce 
during the first half of  the company lost some contract business to its competition because of competitive pricing and because of contractual disputes  and  in certain cases  litigation with several of its customers  which resulted in a decrease in sales of value added products and a need to increase sales to the spot market 
in the third quarter of pursuant to mutual agreement with the board of directors  the company s chairman and chief executive officer and its president resigned their positions 
in the fourth quarter of  all customer litigation was resolved 
the company continues to contend with extremely high and unprecedented costs for raw materials and energy  as well as its high levels of long term debt and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
for the third year in a row  the company recognized non cash fourth quarter pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges  which accelerate the recognition of actuarial losses 
while these charges do not affect funding of the benefit plans  they substantially contributed to net losses of and in and  respectively 
the company continues to face stringent environmental regulations and has announced its intention to spend to install new environmental equipment at its middletown works 

table of contents the company has partially mitigated these unfavorable factors by aggressively improving productivity and quality  lowering operating and overhead costs  reducing discretionary spending wherever prudent  and  most recently  adding surcharges to the price of carbon  stainless and electrical steel sold primarily in the spot market 
unlike some competitors  the company did not experience recent interruptions in its supply of coke and  during  increased its own coke making production 
with an environment of improving customer relations  an improving economy and the realization of cost savings from newly implemented earnings improvement initiatives  the fourth quarter of was the most successful in with respect to shipments  sales and operating results  excluding the goodwill impairment and pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges 
value added shipments were trending higher in the fourth quarter of and the order book for the first quarter of is full 
in addition to the new raw material and energy cost surcharges  which were initiated in the first quarter of  the company has announced three carbon steel and two stainless steel spot market price increases 
the company announced price increases for carbon steels of to per ton  depending on the product  and announced stainless steel price increases totaling 
sales to the spot market comprise approximately of total net sales and  while the company may discuss similar increases with some of its contract customers  there can be no assurance that those customers will agree to such increases 
the company ended the year with of cash and of availability under its two credit facilities  representing total liquidity of compared to steel shipments in and were  tons and  tons  respectively 
the year to year increase was primarily due to higher shipments of hot rolled steel products that offset reduced shipments to contract customers in the automotive  appliance  construction and manufacturing markets and continued weakness in the stainless and electrical steel markets 
lower contract shipments in were  in part  the result of customers lost to competitors  who brought back previously idled production capacity as the company sought to increase prices and  simultaneously  remain a predominant source of value added steels to certain contract customers 
this strategy had a particularly adverse effect on appliance shipments  which the company replaced with shipments to the distributor  service center and converter markets 
value added products comprised only of total shipments for  down from for as higher hot rolled shipments offset lower cold rolled  coated and stainless and electrical shipments 
tons shipped by product category for and were as follows tons in thousands stainless electrical coated cold rolled tubular subtotal value added shipments hot rolled secondary total shipments 
table of contents net sales in were  compared to  in while overall net contract pricing was higher in  reduced sales were primarily the result of lower spot market pricing and a weaker product mix due to a decline in shipments to contract automotive and appliance customers and increased shipments to distributors  service centers and converter spot market customers 
as a result  average selling prices fell to per ton in from in sales attributable to major market groups as a percent of total sales for and were as follows automotive appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction distributors  service centers and converters the company s reported operating losses for the years and were and  respectively 
included in these results were several large pre tax expense benefit items  which are described more fully below 
exclusion of these items from operating loss is presented in order to clarify the effects of reduced net sales and increased net operating expenses on the company s financial results 
operating loss  as reported pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges goodwill impairment insurance settlement impairment of equity investment operating profit loss  pro forma in addition to the impact of reduced sales  operating results for compared to were unfavorably affected by higher raw material and energy costs and higher operating costs  including a increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
in and  lifo charges of and  respectively  reflected progressively increasing costs in both years 
compared to  input costs increased for natural gas  for scrap and for purchased carbon slabs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced a plan to eliminate approximately salaried positions  equivalent to approximately of the salaried workforce 
these reductions are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately beginning in in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized charges totaling for costs associated with this program 
operating costs in were also unfavorably impacted by an planned middletown works blast furnace maintenance outage and a write off of equipment at the middletown works  including a sinter plant following a change to a type of iron ore pellet that avoids the need to produce high cost sinter 
during  the company also recognized start up costs of for an ashland works coke battery that had been on hot idle and is expected to achieve savings in excess of per year compared to the current costs of purchasing coke 
results in also were adversely affected by of expenses incurred in connection with the company s efforts to acquire the assets of national steel corporation 
under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognizes into its results of operations  as a fourth quarter noncash corridor adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets 
amounts inside this corridor are amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants 
actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the many assumptions used to value the benefit plans  or when the assumptions change  as they may each year when a valuation is performed 
the effect of prevailing interest rates on the discount rate used to value projected plan obligations as of the october measurement date is one of the more important factors used to determine the company s year end liability  fourth quarter corridor adjustment and subsequent year s expense for these benefit plans 
in  a one half percent reduction in the discount rate to reflect declines in prevailing interest rates  changes in certain retirement 
table of contents and other actuarial assumptions and other actuarial losses lead the company to record fourth quarter corridor charges of related to its pension plans and related to its other postretirement benefit plans 
the company also recorded a charge against equity of to recognize its minimum pension liability 
the actuarial net loss that gave rise to the pension charge for was substantially lower than in due to a actual return on plan assets  which exceeded the assumed return used to calculate the pension expense at the end of in  the combination of a loss on pension plan assets compared to an assumed return  a one half percent decrease in the discount rate and other actuarial losses resulted in a pension corridor charge of similarly  in  due to the decrease in the discount rate and rising healthcare costs  the company also recognized a corridor charge of related to its other postretirement benefit plans 
based on current assumptions  no required cash payments to the pension plans are expected in see liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion of funding requirements and pending pension legislation 
the company is required to annually review for possible impairment most of its goodwill 
recognizing continued softness in the carbon  stainless and electrical steel markets affecting both pricing and volumes and high raw material and energy costs  in addition to other factors  the company s management determined that the fair value of the company s flat rolled steel reporting unit had declined 
in the third quarter of  management engaged an outside consultant to determine the fair value of its flat rolled steel reporting unit using a present value model 
based on this analysis  the company concluded that a decline in its flat rolled steel reporting unit s business had led to an impairment of the value of the related goodwill below the amount at which it was carried on the balance sheet 
as a result  in  the company recognized a non cash impairment charge of the remaining goodwill on the december  consolidated balance sheet primarily relates to the tubular business  including of goodwill related to ak tube s third quarter acquisition of arvinmeritor s central tubing facility 
in order to fully recognize the deferred tax asset recorded on its financial statements related to net operating loss carryforwards  the company must generate taxable income sufficient to utilize its carryforwards before they expire 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the third quarter of  a forecast of lower projected taxable income indicated that a decrease in the deferred tax asset was necessary and the company recognized an non cash charge to record an additional valuation allowance 
the company s operating results were favorably affected by a pre tax benefit of arising from insurance settlements entered into by the company with certain of its insurance carriers  partially offset by an increase in environmental reserves 
the settlement amount represented a negotiated dollar value the company accepted for reimbursement of past environmental and asbestos expenditures and  to a lesser extent  to release those insurance companies from a responsibility to reimburse the company for future covered expenditures under the policies 
other existing insurance policies covering asbestos and environmental contingencies may serve to mitigate future covered expenditures 
in addition  the company maintains reserves for future probable payments related to asbestos claim settlements and environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation  which do not consider the potential for insurance recoveries 
if these reserves are not adequate to cover future claims  then the company s financial position  operating results and cash flows may be negatively impacted 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax impairment of its investment in eveleth taconite mines llc evtac  a business the company accounted for using the equity method 
evtac  a company that produced iron ore pellets used in the production of steel  was a joint venture of ak steel  rouge steel and stelco 
the impairment  which reduced the carrying value of evtac to zero  resulted from the joint venture s loss of several major customers  including the company  which elected to purchase most of its iron ore requirements from other suppliers 
evtac subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection and sold all of its assets 
however  after settling its liabilities  no assets were available for distribution to the equity holders 
on june   the company issued and sold of senior notes due net of the discount to the initial purchasers and fees  the sale generated cash proceeds of on july   these proceeds  along with cash on hand  were used to redeem all of the company s senior notes due 
table of contents at a total cost of  which included a redemption premium of in the twelve months ended december   the company recognized a pre tax loss of for the redemption of the senior notes 
in the first quarter of  the company liquidated all of the nearly million shares of anthem inc stock it had received in upon the demutualization of its primary healthcare insurance provider 
the company recorded a gain on the sale of this stock of  which was included in income from continuing operations in in the fourth quarter of  the company performed an impairment review of the carrying amount of two businesses accounted for as cost investments 
based on the company s review of their business plans and future prospects  it determined that the carrying amount of its investments in the companies were impaired and recognized charges in other income expense totaling to write down the investments to their estimated fair values 
on april   the company sold its sawhill tubular division for  recording an after tax loss of sawhill tubular generated a net after tax loss of from the beginning of to the date of sale 
in october  the board of directors authorized management to proceed with a plan to sell douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park and  in february  the company entered into agreements for the sale of both businesses 
the company expects the two sales transactions to generate total cash proceeds of approximately after estimated fees and expenses  resulting in a pretax gain of approximately the company does not anticipate any material income tax payments in conjunction with these transactions 
the sales are subject to completion of due diligence and customary closing conditions 
the sales of these businesses  which are expected to occur in the first quarter of  will enable management to better concentrate on the company s core operations and to reduce debt 
in and  douglas dynamics recorded after tax income of  and  respectively  due to stronger economic conditions and significantly higher snowfalls in its market areas  and greens port recorded income of and  respectively 
the results of sawhill tubular as well as of douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park are classified as discontinued operations 
the company s net losses in and were  or per share  and  or per share  respectively 
the increase in the net loss in from that in was primarily due to lower sales  higher operating costs  the impairment of goodwill and the increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  partially offset by lower pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges 
compared to total steel shipments for the twelve months ended december  and were  tons and  tons  respectively 
steel shipments increased primarily due to record automotive shipments and  to a lesser extent  the addition of ak tube  which was acquired in the third quarter of value added products comprised over of total shipments  compared to approximately in shipments of hot rolled products increased in the second half of as the company took advantage of attractive spot market pricing for this commodity grade steel 
tons shipped by product for and were as follows tons in thousands stainless electrical coated cold rolled tubular subtotal value added shipments hot rolled secondary total shipments 
table of contents net sales in were  a nearly increase over the  reported for flat rolled sales per ton increased to per ton in compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of increased shipments to the automotive sector and higher spot market prices 
sales attributable to major market groups as a percent of total sales for and were as follows automotive appliance  industrial machinery and equipment  and construction distributors  service centers and converters operating losses in the years and contained the following pre tax expense benefit items 
exclusion of these items is presented in order to clarify the effects of increased net sales and higher costs on operating results 
operating loss  as reported pension and other postretirement benefit corridor charges insurance settlement impairment of equity investment stock received in insurance demutualization operating profit  pro forma under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognized fourth quarter corridor charges in and of and  respectively 
during  there was no charge related to other post retirement benefit plans  though a investment loss on pension plan assets compared to an assumed return  and a percentage point decrease in the discount rate  required the recognition of a non cash pre tax pension corridor charge of in addition  because the decline in asset value in also caused the company s principal pension plans to become underfunded  the company recorded a non cash after tax reduction in equity of approximately in the fourth quarter of  anthem inc  the company s primary health insurance provider  converted from a mutual insurance company to a corporation  issuing shares of common stock to certain of its long time policyholders 
as a major policyholder  ak steel received approximately million shares of anthem common stock as a result of this demutualization  recording a pre tax benefit of the benefit was net of a liability established for the portion of the proceeds deemed to be healthcare plan assets 
in the first quarter of  the company liquidated all of these shares for total proceeds of  recording a non operating pre tax gain of operating losses increased in  in part due to higher pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
the increase in pension expense was primarily due to unfavorable investment returns in  lower asset balances and a decrease in the rate of expected returns from to 
the higher other postretirement benefit expense reflected an increase in current and future assumed healthcare trend rates 
operating costs in also included higher costs for scheduled blast furnace outages at the middletown and ashland works  and other planned and unplanned maintenance work and increasing scrap and purchased slab prices 
the higher costs in resulted in a charge from an increase in lifo inventory reserves 
in  declining costs resulted in a lifo credit of the increased costs were in large part offset by the benefits of higher shipment volumes  strong automotive shipments and higher spot market pricing 
overall contract pricing was lower in  but the company was able to negotiate higher contract pricing that became effective at various times in the second half of the year 
cost savings were achieved through improved unit productivity and product quality  as well as reduced overtime and discretionary spending 

table of contents the company accounts for three of its businesses as discontinued operations 
during and  douglas dynamics recorded after tax income of and  respectively  and greens port recorded after tax income of and  respectively 
for the same periods  sawhill tubular recorded after tax losses of and  respectively 
sawhill tubular s loss was recorded through the date of its sale on april   at which time  the company recorded a after tax loss on the sale 
the company s net loss in of  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share 
the comparative results reflected net increases in costs  including postretirement benefit expenses and maintenance costs  partially offset by improved shipments  pricing and productivity  and reduced spending 
outlook the company expects its shipments in to be approximately million tons  slightly higher than in shipments to the automotive sector are expected to be higher than in due to projected strong automotive demand and the company s efforts to improve its relationships with automotive customers 
in addition  demand and pricing in the spot market during the first quarter of has been substantially higher than at the beginning of and demand for stainless and electrical steel products is beginning to strengthen 
the company has announced several spot market price increases and the initiation of a surcharge related to increased costs for natural gas  purchased carbon slabs and steel scrap to be added to the price of its steel sold primarily in the spot market 
the company is also seeking agreement from its contract customers to accept a similar surcharge  although there can be no assurance that those customers will agree to such a surcharge 
value added products are expected to exceed of the company s total shipments in  up from in the company expects its pension and other postretirement benefit expense to increase approximately in  prior to any potential fourth quarter corridor adjustment 
the anticipated increase is primarily due to a one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to value liabilities and a quarter percentage point reduction in assumed investment returns on pension plan assets in under the company s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting method  the annual determination of a fourth quarter adjustment  if any  is made as of the plans october measurement date 
since the balance of deferred actuarial losses for all major pension and other postretirement benefit plans was at or near the edge of the corridor at the end of  the development of any additional net actuarial losses  which may result from a further decline in interest rates  poor investment returns or adverse changes in assumptions would likely result in another corridor charge in the fourth quarter of based on current assumptions  no required cash payments to the pension plan trusts are expected in see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of funding requirements 
the company expects overhead costs in to be below levels  primarily due to a reduced number of salaried employees  reduced active salaried employee benefits and the benefits of other cost containment efforts  partially offset by the higher pension and other postretirement benefit costs described above 
in addition  there continues to be significant price volatility in energy markets  including the cost of natural gas  though the effect of normal market volatility on the company s natural gas costs is partially offset by its hedging strategies 
the company is currently experiencing rising prices for scrap and purchased slabs 
depreciation is expected to decrease approximately from levels 
the company has initiated discussions with its major unions in an effort to modify their contracts and negotiate cost savings to improve the company s competitive position 
in the first quarter of  the company expects to ship approximately  tons  compared to  tons shipped in the fourth quarter of while the company anticipates continued strong shipments to automotive customers and improving demand for stainless and electrical steel  planned maintenance outages at its middletown facility and a planned inventory build  in anticipation of a major second quarter outage  will adversely affect first quarter shipments 
the benefits of higher pricing in the spot market will not be realized on a substantial portion of the company s shipments due to timing issues and its reliance on contract business  which accounts for approximately of sales and for which prices have already been determined 
the company also 
table of contents expects a significant increase in the prices paid for carbon scrap and purchased slabs  as well as higher natural gas prices and the anticipated increases in pension and other postretirement benefit expenses discussed above 
as a result of these factors  the company expects to report both an operating loss and a net loss for the first quarter of as a result of the anticipated sales of douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park in the first quarter of  the company expects to recognize pretax gains of approximately however  the divestiture of these two businesses could have an unfavorable effect on future net income loss and cash flows  which is expected to be partially offset by lower interest expense as much of the proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce outstanding debt 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had of cash and cash equivalents  of availability under a accounts receivable purchase credit facility and of availability under a new  five year senior revolving credit facility that is secured by certain of the company s inventories 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under either credit facility  however  availability under the facilities was reduced by of outstanding letters of credit and reduced pools of eligible accounts receivables and inventories 
availability under both facilities fluctuates monthly with the varying levels of eligible collateral 
the accounts receivable purchase credit facility expires on september  the company has commenced discussions with several banks and financial institutions and expects to have a replacement facility finalized before the expiration date 
based on currently available liquidity  the company s expectation of improved cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the expected sales of douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park  which are expected to be used primarily to reduce debt  management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its cash needs for capital investments  working capital  employee benefit obligations  debt service and the funding of operations 
during  cash used by continuing operations totaled following two years of significant cash generation by operating activities  the cash outflow reflects lower sales and increased operating losses 
while shipment volumes increased in  cash generated from the sale of steel declined due to lower selling prices and an increase in outstanding accounts receivable 
average selling prices declined per ton to per ton in cost of products sold  however  increased as a result of a significant rise in the prices paid for raw materials  particularly scrap and purchased slabs  and energy  primarily natural gas  as well as a increase in payments for other postretirement benefits and the higher shipping levels 
the company used of cash to reduce accounts payable and other current liabilities  but generated of cash by more aggressively managing inventory levels 
management believes working capital levels are appropriate in the current business environment and does not expect a significant increase or reduction of working capital for the year investing activities in used of cash  including for capital investments and for the purchase by ak tube of the stainless tube mill previously owned by arvinmeritor 
cash used by financing activities in totaled  including for a scheduled debt repayment 
for the year  discontinued operations generated of cash 
discontinued operations the anticipated sales of douglas dynamics and greens port industrial park are expected to generate total proceeds of approximately after estimated fees and expenses 
the company does not anticipate any material income tax payments in conjunction with these transactions 
a significant portion of the proceeds of these sales would be used to reduce outstanding debt 
because these businesses generated positive cash flows  their sale is expected to result in a decline in the company s consolidated annual cash flows commensurate with their profitability 
however  the company expects that this decline would be partially offset by a reduction in future interest and principal payments on debt retired with the proceeds of the sales 

table of contents dividends the payment of cash dividends is subject to a restrictive covenant contained in the instruments governing most of the company s outstanding senior notes 
the covenant allows the payment of dividends  if declared by the board of directors  and the redemption or purchase of shares of its outstanding capital stock  subject to a formula that reflects cumulative net earnings 
as a result of losses recorded during the last two years  the company is unable to pay a dividend or redeem stock under this formula 
financial covenants the indentures and other instruments governing the company s senior indebtedness as well as its two revolving credit facilities contain restrictions and covenants that may limit the company s operating flexibility 
the senior note indentures impose restrictions regarding the amount of sale leaseback transactions  transactions by subsidiaries and with affiliates  use of proceeds from asset sales and some investments 
furthermore  the senior note indentures impose the following additional restrictions maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least to failure to meet this covenant will limit the amount of additional debt the company can incur 
as of december   the ratio was to restricted payments  which consist primarily of dividends and share repurchases  are limited to plus of cumulative net income or minus of cumulative net loss from april  in addition  without regard to this restriction  cumulative aggregate dividend payments of up to are permitted between april  and june  the instruments governing the senior secured notes due contain the same restrictions as the senior note indentures regarding restricted payments and also require the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio total debt to total capitalization of not more than 
at december   the leverage ratio was 
failure to comply with this covenant could require prepayment of the outstanding of senior secured notes prior to the december  maturity date 
if required  the company believes that it has adequate sources of liquidity to prepay the notes 
the company s inventory based revolving credit facility contains restrictions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of capital stock  the incurrence of debt  the amount of sale leaseback transactions  the acquisition and sale of assets  and the amount of annual capital expenditures 
also  the facility requires maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio  if average availability falls below capital investments the company anticipates capital investments of approximately  which are expected to be funded from available cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
this amount includes of the investment at its middletown works required to comply with air pollution standards recently promulgated by the us environmental protection agency 
the company anticipates the total cost of the project of approximately will be spent between and  a portion of which may be financed by tax exempt borrowings 
at december   commitments for future capital investments totaled approximately employee benefit obligations based on the assumptions used to value other postretirement benefits  primarily retiree healthcare and life insurance benefits  in the fourth quarter of  cash payments for these benefits are expected to be in a range of between and in each of the next years 
based on current assumptions  no cash payments to the pension plans are required in the amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends 
table of contents on future investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements  among other things and  accordingly  the company cannot reasonably estimate actual required payments 
currently  the company s major pension plans are significantly underfunded 
as a result  absent major increases in long term interest rates  above average returns on pension plan assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements  the company will be required to make contributions to its pension trusts of varying amounts in the long term 
some of these contributions could be substantial 
however  the congress of the united states is currently considering legislation designed to help companies primarily in the domestic airline and steel industries 
this legislation  if enacted  would reduce ak steel s funding obligations for the next two years by increasing the discount rate used to value the plans and deferring any deficit reduction contributions that would otherwise be required 
if legislation that includes deficit reduction relief for which the company qualifies passes in substantially its current form  the company currently estimates that it would be required to make pension contributions of between zero and in this estimate assumes no change in the assumed discount rates and expected returns on pension assets 
on december   the united states government enacted the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of among other provisions  the act provides a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that include a qualified prescription drug benefit 
the company sponsors such a plan and can  therefore  expect to benefit in the future from this subsidy 
however  because certain accounting issues are raised by the act  including how to account for the federal subsidy  and sponsors may not have sufficiently reliable information available on which to measure the effects of the act  among other reasons  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position no 
fas  which allows plan sponsors to defer recognition of the effects of the act on its financial statements 
as required by the fasb staff position  because the company s october  measurement date preceded the effective date of the act  the company is not permitted to recognize the effects of the act until the first quarter of as a result  any measures of accumulated postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit expenses included in the financial statements do not include the anticipated effects of the act 
the company estimates that in  recognition of the federal subsidy will reduce accumulated postretirement benefit obligations by approximately to and reduce the annual net periodic postretirement benefit expense by approximately specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy  when issued  could affect these estimates and require the company to change previously reported information 
energy and raw material hedging the company enters into derivative transactions in the ordinary course of business to hedge the price of natural gas and certain raw materials 
on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   current and non current assets included and  respectively  for the fair value of these derivatives 
changes in the prices paid for the related commodities are expected to offset the effect on cash of settling these amounts 
off balance sheet arrangements the company holds an equity interest in a number of entities that are not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
combined metals of chicago llc is one of these entities 
the company has provided a letter of credit to support a portion of combined metals bank indebtedness proportionate to the company s equity investment 
the fair value of this guarantee  which is not material  is recorded in accrued liabilities 
the company holds an equity interest in ak isg steel coating company and guarantees its performance under an equipment lease that terminates in at december   the company s maximum liability under this guarantee was approximately  which was not recorded on its financial statements because it originated before the effective date of fasb interpretation no 
payment of any amounts under this guarantee  if necessary  would be made in monthly installments through early 
table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into agreements under which it is obligated to make legally enforceable future payments 
these agreements include those related to borrowing money  leasing equipment and purchasing goods and services 
the following table summarizes by category expected future cash outflows associated with contractual obligations in effect as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total in calculating the amounts for purchase obligations the company first identified all contracts under which the company has a legally enforceable obligation to purchase products or services from the vendor and or make payments to the vendor for an identifiable period of time 
then for each identified contract  the company determined its best estimate of payments to be made under the contract assuming the continued operation of existing production facilities  normal business levels and the contract would be adhered to in good faith by both parties throughout its term 
because of changes in the markets it serves  changes in business decisions regarding production levels or unforeseen events  the actual amounts paid under these contracts could differ significantly from the numbers presented above 
a number of the purchase contracts specify a minimum volume or price for the products or services covered by the contract 
if the company were to purchase only the minimums specified  the payments set forth in the table would be reduced 
under requirements contracts the quantities of goods or services the company is required to purchase may vary depending on its needs  which are dependent on production levels and market conditions at the time 
if the company s business deteriorates or increases  the amount it is required to purchase under such a contract would likely change 
many of the agreements for the purchase of goods and services allow the company to terminate the contract without penalty upon to days prior notice 
any such termination could reduce the projected payments 
the company s consolidated balance sheets contain reserves for pension and other postretirement benefits and other long term liabilities 
the benefit plan liabilities are calculated using actuarial assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  because changes in circumstances can have a significant effect on the liabilities and expenses associated with these plans including  in the case of pensions  pending legislation  the company cannot reasonably and accurately project payments into the future 
while the company does not include information about these plans in the above table  it discusses these benefits elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the notes to its financial statements  set forth in item the other long term liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets include reserves for environmental and legal issues  employment related benefits  insurance and other reserves  which are not included in the above table 
these amounts generally do not arise from contractual negotiations with the parties receiving payment in exchange for goods and services 
the ultimate amount and timing of payments are subject to significant uncertainty and  in many cases  are contingent on the occurrence of future events  such as the filing of a claim or completion of due diligence investigations  settlement negotiations  documentation or legal proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles permit choices among alternatives and require numerous 
table of contents estimates of financial matters 
the company believes the accounting principles chosen are appropriate under the circumstances  and that the estimates  judgments and assumptions involved in its financial reporting are reasonable 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership passes 
this is when the products are shipped per customers instructions  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
inventory costing inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw material  energy and other inventoriable costs more quickly than other methods 
other inventories  consisting mostly of foreign inventories and certain raw materials  are measured principally at average cost 
use of estimates accounting estimates are based on historical experience and information that is available to management about current events and actions the company may take in the future 
significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of long lived assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  environmental and legal liabilities  and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as a reserve for the loss that would be incurred if a customer is unable to pay amounts due to the company 
while  based on the company s experience  losses due to customer defaults have been low  if in the future the financial condition of some customers deteriorates to an extent that may affect their ability to pay  additional allowances may be needed 
approximately of trade receivables outstanding at december  are due from businesses associated with the us automotive industry 
except in a few situations where the risk warrants it  collateral is not required on trade receivables 
while the company believes its recorded trade receivables will be collected  in the event of default in payment of a trade receivable  the company would follow normal collection procedures 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in estimating levels of future taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax asset  the company has considered historical results of operations and the cyclicality of the steel business and would  if necessary  consider the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to generate future taxable income 
if future taxable income is less than the amount that has been assumed in determining the deferred tax asset  then an increase in the valuation allowance will be required  with a corresponding charge against income 
on the other hand  if future taxable income exceeds the level that has been assumed in calculating the deferred tax asset  the valuation allowance could be reduced  with a corresponding credit to income 
the company is involved in a number of environmental and other legal proceedings  including some related to asbestos exposure 
the company records a liability when it has determined that litigation has commenced or a claim or assessment has been asserted and  based on available information  it is probable that the outcome of such litigation  claim or assessment  whether by decision or settlement  will be unfavorable 
the company measures the liability using available information  including the extent of damage  similar historical situations  its allocable share of the liability and  in the case of environmental liabilities  the need to provide site investigation  remediation and future monitoring and maintenance 
accruals of probable costs have been made based on a combination of litigation and settlement strategies on a case by case basis and  where appropriate  are supplemented with incurred but not reported development reserves 
however  amounts recognized in the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states exclude 
table of contents potential payments that not are probable or that may not be currently estimable 
the ultimate costs of these environmental and legal proceedings may  therefore  be higher than those currently recognized 
in addition  results of operations in any future period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or by the effectiveness of these strategies 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans under its method of accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the company recognizes into income  as a fourth quarter adjustment  any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets  defined as the corridor 
amounts inside this corridor are amortized over the average remaining service life of active plan participants 
this method results in faster recognition of actuarial net gains and losses than the minimum amortization method permitted by prevailing accounting standards and used by the vast majority of companies in the united states 
faster recognition limits the amounts by which balance sheet assets and liabilities differ from economic net assets or obligations related to the plans 
however  faster recognition under this method also results in the potential for highly volatile and difficult to forecast corridor adjustments  similar to those recognized in recent years 
under the applicable accounting standards  actuarial net gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from any of the many assumptions used to value the benefit plans or when the assumptions change  as they may each year when a valuation is performed 
the major factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses for pension plans are the differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used to value pension liabilities as of the measurement date 
for other postretirement benefit plans  differences in estimated versus actual healthcare costs  changes in assumed healthcare cost trend rates or a change in the difference between the discount rate and the healthcare trend rate are major factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses 
in addition to the potential for corridor adjustments  these factors affect future net periodic benefit expenses 
changes in key assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of annual expense recognized 
for example  a one percentage point decrease in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase the projected pension expense by approximately before tax 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would increase projected other postretirement benefit expense by approximately before tax 
the discount rate used to value liabilities and assets affects both pensions and other postretirement benefit calculations 
a one quarter percentage point decrease in this rate would increase pension expense by and other postretirement expense by these estimates exclude any potential fourth quarter corridor adjustments 
investments the company s financial statements consolidate the operations and accounts of the company and all subsidiaries in which the company has a controlling interest 
the company also has investments in associated companies that are accounted for under the equity method and  because the operations of these companies are integrated with the company s basic steelmaking operations  its proportionate share of their income loss is reflected in the company s cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the company holds investments in debt securities and minor holdings in equity securities  which are accounted for as available for sale or held to maturity cost investments 
the company has no investments that it accounts for as trading securities 
each of the company s investments is subject to a review for impairment  if and when  circumstances indicate that a loss in value below its carrying amount is other than temporary 
under these circumstances  the company would write the investment down to its fair value  which would become its new carrying amount 
the company s investment in afsg holdings  inc represents the carrying value of its discontinued insurance and finance leasing businesses  which have been largely liquidated 
the activities of the remaining operating companies are being runoff and the companies are accounted for  collectively  as a discontinued operation under the liquidation basis of accounting  whereby future cash inflows and outflows are considered 
the company is under no obligation to support the operations or liabilities of these companies 

table of contents financial instruments the company is a party to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges under the financial accounting standards board s fasb s statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related pronouncements 
the company s objective in using such instruments is to protect its earnings and cash flows from fluctuations in the fair value of selected commodities and currencies 
for example  in the ordinary course of business  the company uses cash settled commodity price swaps  with a duration of up to three years  to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum and zinc requirements 
the company designates these swaps as cash flow hedges and the resulting changes in their fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income 
subsequent gains and losses are recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
as of december   currently valued outstanding commodity hedges would result in the reclassification into earnings of in net of tax gains within the next twelve months 
based on such reviews as it deems reasonable and appropriate  the company believes that all counterparties to its outstanding derivative instruments are entities with substantial credit worthiness 
goodwill at december   the company s assets included of goodwill 
each year  as required by statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs an evaluation of goodwill to test this balance for possible impairment 
the evaluation requires that the reporting unit underlying the goodwill be measured at fair value and  if this value is less than the carrying value of the unit  a second test must be performed 
under the second test  the current fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the unit including an amount for implied goodwill 
if implied goodwill is less than the net carrying amount of goodwill  then the difference becomes the amount of the impairment that must be recorded in that year 
during  the company performed the first test and determined that the fair value of its tubular and equity investment reporting units  which support certain of its goodwill balance  exceeded their carrying value and no further testing was required 
however  upon performing the required first test on its flat rolled steel reporting unit  the company determined that the fair value did not support the of goodwill related to that group 
the company determined that the implied goodwill related to this group was zero and  accordingly  the entire amount of the goodwill balance was impaired requiring a corresponding charge to the company s operating results 
the company s businesses operate in highly cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate  which may lead to further impairment charges in future operating costs 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised fasb interpretation no 
 entitled  consolidation of variable interest entities 
as revised  the new interpretation requires that the company consolidate all variable interest entities in its financial statements under certain circumstances 
the company will adopt the revised interpretation as of march   as required  but has not yet determined if the interpretation will have a material effect on its financial statements 
forward looking statements certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this form k  or made in press releases or in oral presentations made by company employees  reflect management s estimates and beliefs and are intended to be  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in particular  these include but are not limited to statements in the foregoing paragraphs entitled  raw materials  competition  environmental  legal proceedings  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations overview  outlook  liquidity and capital resources  tabular disclosure of contractual obligations  critical accounting policies and estimates  and new accounting pronouncements 
in addition  these include statements in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the paragraphs entitled  property plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  
table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits accounting  concentrations of credit risk  financial instruments  income taxes  commitments  and environmental and legal contingencies 
the company cautions readers that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently expected by management 
in addition to those noted in the statements themselves  these factors include  but are not limited to  the following risks of recessionary conditions in the general economy and in the cyclical steel industry  reduced domestic automotive production  changes in demand for the company s products  including the possible need to shift shipments to the spot market from the contract market  unanticipated plant outages  equipment failures or labor difficulties  actions by the company s domestic and foreign competitors  their employees and labor unions  interest rate volatility and declining prices in the securities markets  which affect pension plan assets and the calculation of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expenses  continuing escalation in medical cost trend rates that affects active employee and retiree benefit expenses  unanticipated increases in the prices for  or disruptions in the supply of  raw materials and energy  particularly natural gas  scrap  coal and purchased carbon slabs  unexpected outcomes of major litigation  environmental issues and other contingencies  changes in application or scope of environmental regulations applicable to the company  changes in united states trade policy and governmental actions with respect to imports  particularly the possible impact of restrictions or tariffs on the importation of carbon slabs  timely completion of business or asset purchases and sales  including receipt of regulatory agency approvals  and that future expected cost savings from a business combination or cost reduction initiatives may not be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk dollars in millions in the ordinary course of business  the company s market risk includes changes in a interest rates  b the prices of raw materials and energy sources  and c foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages interest rate risk by issuing substantially all of its debt securities on a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of this debt as of december  is  which was determined primarily from valuations provided by financial consultants 
a reduction in prevailing interest rates or improvement in the company s credit rating could increase the fair value of this debt 
a reduction in the rate used to discount total future principal and interest payments of would result in an increase in the total fair value of the company s long term debt of approximately an unfavorable effect on the company s results and cash flows from exposure to interest rate declines and a corresponding increase in the fair value of its debt would result only if the company elected to repurchase its outstanding debt securities at prevailing market prices 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in the price of certain commodities 
approximately of ak steel s sales in were made under long term contracts that generally do not permit adjustment of selling prices in response to changes in the costs of raw materials and energy 
therefore  a rise in the price of energy  particularly natural gas  raw materials or other commodities is  for the most part  absorbed by the company rather than passed on to the customer 
in recent years  natural gas prices  in particular  have increased significantly and have been highly volatile 
at normal consumption levels  a per million btu rise in natural gas prices would result in an approximately decrease in annual pre tax operating results  excluding the offsetting effects of any then existing hedging instruments 
in addition  
table of contents due to increased demand from foreign steel producers  the costs of unfinished carbon steel slabs and scrap both of which are purchased by the company and are not susceptible to hedging have risen significantly and those cost increases have adversely affected the company s margins 
however  in the first quarter of  the company announced that it would add a surcharge to the price of steel sold to the spot market to offset price increases paid for purchased slabs  scrap and natural gas 
in addition  in the case of stainless steel  increased costs for nickel  chrome and molybdenum can usually be recovered through established price surcharges 
the company uses cash settled commodity price swaps and or options to hedge the price of a portion of its natural gas  nickel  aluminum and zinc requirements 
the company s hedging strategy is designed to protect it against normal volatility 
however  abnormal price increases in any of these commodity markets could negatively impact operating costs 
gains and losses from the use of these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss includes in unrealized net of tax gains for the fair value of these derivative instruments 
the following table presents the negative effect on pretax income of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december  due to an assumed and decrease in the market price of each of the indicated commodities 
commodity derivative decrease decrease natural gas nickel aluminum zinc because these instruments are structured and used as hedges  these hypothetical losses would be offset by the benefit of lower prices paid for the physical commodity used in the normal production cycle 
the company currently does not enter into swap or option contracts for trading purposes 
the company is also subject to risks of exchange rate fluctuations on a small portion of intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies 
forward currency contracts are used to manage exposures to certain of these currency price fluctuations 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency contracts with a total notional value of for the sale of euros 
based on the contracts outstanding at the end of  a increase in the dollar to euro exchange rate would result in a pretax loss in the value of these contracts  which would offset the income benefit of a more favorable exchange rate
