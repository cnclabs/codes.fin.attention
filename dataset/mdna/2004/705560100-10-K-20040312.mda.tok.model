item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
except for historical information  the discussion below contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of company overview and industry outlook peet s is a specialty coffee roaster and marketer of branded fresh roasted whole bean coffee sold through multiple channels of distribution 
since the founding of our business in  we have established a strong customer base and brand recognition in california 
our national expansion strategy is based on the sale of whole bean coffee in multiple channels of distribution 
currently  our expansion strategy is focused in the western united states  where we have more physical presence and higher customer awareness 
we expect the specialty coffee industry to continue to grow 
we believe that this growth will be fueled by continued consumer interest in high quality coffee and related products 
our operations are vertically integrated 
we purchase arabica coffee beans from countries around the world  apply our artisan roasting techniques and ship fresh coffee daily to our stores and customers within hours of roasting 
control of purchasing  roasting  packaging and distribution of our coffee allows us to maintain our commitment to freshness is cost effective and enhances our margins and profit potential 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies inventory 
raw materials consist primarily of green bean coffee 
finished goods include roasted coffee  tea  accessory products  spices  and packaged foods 
all products are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method  except green bean and roasted coffee  which is valued at the average cost 
we continually evaluate the composition of our coffee related merchandise and mark down such inventory as needed 
our historical inventory write offs have been immaterial 
intangibles and other assets 
during  we entered into a contractual agreement with safeway inc  a national grocery chain  to sell peet s coffee through its grocery stores 
we began shipping during the third quarter of the agreement included an upfront payment to safeway inc that we recorded in intangibles and other assets and is being amortized as a reduction of revenue based upon estimated sales during the contract period 
long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived asset and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued workers compensation 
in march  we modified our workers compensation insurance policy to a high deductible insurance program with an overall program ceiling to minimize exposure 
we began recording an estimated liability for the self insured portion of the workers compensation claims 
the liability of million recorded as of december  is determined based on information received from our insurance carrier including claims paid  filed and reserved for  as well as using historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the settlement costs increase beyond what was anticipated  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
accrued litigation 
during  two lawsuits were filed against us alleging misclassification of employment position 
the lawsuits sought class action status in addition to damages  restitution  reclassification  and attorneys fees and costs 
the superior court of the state of california  county of orange  granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement of the lawsuits that  subject to the court s final approval  would fully resolve all claims brought by the plaintiffs 
a charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of for the estimated payment of claims to eligible class members  attorneys fees  costs to a third party claims administrator  and applicable employer payroll taxes 
the liability recorded as of december  of million is an estimate and should a greater amount of claims occur or if the court does not certify the settlement  the recorded liability may not be sufficient 
income taxes 
in establishing deferred income tax assets and liabilities  we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws and published tax guidance applicable to its operations 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluate the need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
changes in our valuation of the deferred tax assets or changes in the income tax provision may affect its annual effective income tax rate 
hedge accounting 
we have in the past used coffee futures and options to hedge price increases in price to be fixed coffee purchase commitments and anticipated coffee purchases 
these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
if these derivative instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting  we would have to record the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments directly to earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have also chosen certain accounting policies when options are available  including the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for our stock option awards 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results of using the alternative of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  is included in note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock option and employee purchase plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
business segments our coffee and related items are sold through multiple channels of distribution that are considered separate segments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
these channels provide broad market exposure to potential purchasers of fresh roasted whole bean coffee 
historically  we have operated in three reportable segments retail  online and mail order and specialty sales 
management evaluates segment performance primarily based on revenue and segment operating income 
effective at the beginning of the second quarter of  due to the nature of cross channel marketing and consumer purchase behavior from our multi channel selling strategy  we have had an organizational change  combining the online and mail order segment and the specialty sales segment 
we are indifferent as to where consumers purchase our coffees and teas  so we have aggregated these individual sales channels into one reportable segment 
company operated retail stores operations remain a separate channel due to the beverage component of this business and the percent of overall revenues it represents 
therefore  we currently have two reportable segments  consisting of our retail stores  and specialty sales  which consist of sales to online and mail order customers  and sales to grocery stores  restaurant and food service companies  and office accounts 
we believe growth opportunities exist in all these channels 
our expansion is focused first in developing the western us existing markets where we already have a presence and have a higher customer awareness 
we will continue to open new stores in strategic locations that meet our demographic profile in these markets  make our coffees more broadly and conveniently located in grocery stores  and partner with distributors and companies who share our passion for quality and freshness and are willing and able to execute accordingly in the food service and office environment 
we also will penetrate new domestic markets and channels that we believe can support the sale of specialty coffee  and continue to explore opportunities internationally 
business categories in addition to our reportable segments  we measure our business by monitoring the volume and revenue growth of two distinct business categories whole bean coffee and related products  and beverages and pastries 
we believe these business categories are useful in understanding our results of operations for the periods presented because we operate our stores and record sales through these two categories 
our stores are primarily designed to facilitate the sale of whole bean coffee 
the format of our stores replicates that of a specialty grocer 
beans are scooped from under the counter bins  weighed on counter top scales and hand packed into branded bags 
in addition  each store has a beverage bar that is dedicated to the sale of prepared beverages and artisan baked pastries 
moreover  our two business categories within a store mature at different rates 
when we open a store  the initial sales are primarily beverage and pastry related 
the distance a consumer will travel  or trade area  for beverages and pastries is short usually one to three miles representing a convenience purchase 
consequently  the beverage and pastry business matures rapidly 
the trade area for whole bean coffee is much larger usually three to five miles  representing destination shopping 
whole bean sales from stores mature more slowly typically three to five years 
therefore  sales at newer stores have a much higher beverage and pastry component and shift to a higher whole bean percentage as the store matures 
in  whole bean coffee and related products sales from stores opened for less than years was of net revenue versus for stores opened for more than years 
the dynamics of opening many new stores over the past few years have resulted in a higher beverage and pastry percentage within our net revenue

compared with net revenue net revenue for increased versus as a result of continued expansion of our retail and specialty sales segment  mostly in the western united states 
sales of whole bean and related products increased to million 
sales from beverages and pastries increased to million 
a key element of our multi channel strategy emphasizes the sales of whole bean coffee and related products 
as a result  we continued to derive a majority of our net revenue from the sale of whole bean coffee and related products 
for  whole bean coffee and related products as a percent of net revenue was  same as in in the retail segment  revenue increased compared to primarily as a result of increased sales from new stores we opened since august and existing stores 
sales of whole bean coffee and related products in the retail segment increased by  to million  while sales of beverages and pastries increased by to million 
the increase in beverage and pastry sales is primarily due to the introduction  during the second quarter  of new iced drinks and a revamped bar menu that emphasized many of our customer favorites 
the slower growth in whole bean and related products was due to cannibalization of bean sales in retail stores as we increased the availability of peet s coffee in grocery stores  and the slower maturation of whole bean sales in new stores 
during  we opened a total of stores  an increase of from last year 
this focus will continue as we expect to open approximately to stores in in the specialty sales segment  revenue increased as the result of our continued focus on the grocery and food service channel 
the million increase consisted primarily of a million increase in grocery sales and a million increase in sales to restaurants and food service companies 
the increase in the grocery channel sales was primarily due to sales to approximately  new stores we added during the last months 
during the second half of  we added approximately  safeway stores  of them in the western us in  we added approximately  points of distribution  primarily in the western us through multi location chains such as albertsons  ralph s  and whole foods market 
this brought the total number of grocery stores selling peet s coffee to over  at the end of the increased sales were also driven by the transition  during the first quarter  to a direct store delivery system  where our own route sales representatives deliver to stores weekly  from warehouse distribution 
we believe the direct store delivery system ensures freshness through proper rotation and weekly delivery  optimizes store specific item assortments  achieves proper shelf space and improves free standing display levels  thus increasing the unit sales in each grocery store 
in the restaurant and food service area  the sales increase was primarily due to new accounts added last year and earlier this year such as omni hotels 
sales to the online  mail order and office channels grew primarily due to more emphasis on loyalty programs and the stabilizing office population as the job market and the economy began to recover 
sales to kiosks and licensed partners  representing of net revenue  were down primarily as our japan licensed partner ceased its retail operation 
cost of sales and related occupancy expenses cost of sales and related occupancy expenses consist of product costs  including hedging costs  manufacturing costs  rent and other occupancy costs 
cost of sales increased by primarily as a result of the increase in net revenue and the addition of new stores 
as a percent of net revenue  cost of sales decreased from to due higher retail revenue  which benefited from higher price points generated from new iced drinks and a revamped bar menu 
specialty sales costs decreased as a percent of net revenue as compared to the prior year due to favorable sales mix 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased as compared to as we grew our business 
operating expenses as a percent of net revenue increased primarily due to opening of new stores and the transition to a direct delivery system to support growth in our grocery channel 
in the retail segment  operating expenses as a percent of sales increased by  to 
the increase was due to a increase from opening new stores in the last months and was partially offset by improvement in our existing store operation 
new stores generally have higher operating expenses due to lower sales volume and higher startup cost  including more activities to drive sales 
the improvement in existing operation was mainly due to leveraging our sales growth 
our focus on growing the specialty sales segment  especially grocery  led to an increase in specialty sales operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue 
the factors contributing to the increase included the continued upgrade and addition of sales staff and an increase in distribution costs in the grocery channel 
in the first quarter of  we implemented a direct store delivery system  or dsd  with dedicated route sales representatives delivering our product to grocery stores weekly 
this increased our operating expenses in the areas of payroll  the associated commission and vehicle expenses 
the startup phase of this was completed by the second quarter 
we currently have approximately dsd route sales representatives  of which are full time peet s employees 
we expect to maintain and leverage this operating structure as we continue our expansion in the western us market this year 
marketing and advertising expenses for  marketing and advertising expenses were essentially in line with prior year 
our focus this year has been to attract new customers in our new retail stores and in the grocery channel 
we were able to leverage marketing expenses in other channels 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  or million as compared to the increase was due to a million charge related to the settlement of a wage and hour lawsuit and million in severance expenses related to the departure of two veteran executives 
these charges  taken in the third quarter  reduced our full year diluted earnings per share by 
the settlement is subject to risks identified in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
the increase was partially offset by the restructuring of the executive bonus program and reduced expenses in the areas of stock plan administration and proxy related activities 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased in primarily due to the five stores we opened during the last five months of and the ten stores we opened in this increase was partially offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year 
investment income  net we currently invest excess cash in short term and long term interest bearing  us government and agency securities 
investment income includes interest income and gains from the sale of these instruments 
for  investment income increased million due to the full year impact of income earned from the proceeds of our public offering as compared to seven months in income tax provision this year s corporate income tax rate was versus in the prior year 
our taxable income was reduced primarily by the tax benefit provided by the exercise of stock options and acceleration of depreciation of fixed assets for tax purposes 
these tax benefits reduced our ability to release the valuation allowance on federal and state charitable contribution carryforwards in the current year  thus  increasing our tax rate 
compared with net revenue net revenue for increased by as compared to during  we continued our strategy of selling through multiple channels of distribution 
we accelerated growth in the specialty sales segment  especially in the grocery and food service channels 
revenue derived from the sale of whole bean coffee and related products as a percent of net revenue increased from in to in in the retail segment  revenue increased compared to primarily as a result of increased sales in existing stores and the opening of new retail stores 
the million revenue increase consisted of million from existing stores and million from new stores 
in existing stores  the revenue increase of million was due to increased traffic and million was due to higher average sales transactions 
there were no price increases during the year 
during  we opened five new stores compared to two stores opened in one store was opened during the third quarter while the remaining four stores were opened during the fourth quarter 
we opened more new stores in as we saw the cost and availability of real estate become more favorable in in the specialty sales segment  revenue increased primarily due to sales initiatives focused in the grocery and food service channels 
the million revenue increase consists of million in grocery  million in food service  and million in all other channels such as online and mail order  kiosks and license partners  and office coffee sales 
the accelerated growth in grocery was the result of developing relationships with larger multi location chains such as safeway inc and whole foods markets 
we increased the number of grocery stores selling peet s coffee from locations in to over  in in  we entered into an agreement with safeway to distribute our coffees to approximately  safeway stores across the country 
in july  we rolled out distribution to approximately stores in the western united states  including california  colorado  pacific northwest  arizona  and new mexico 
in september  we rolled out distribution to the remaining stores in the eastern united states  including texas  illinois  and pennsylvania 
in the food service area  the sales increase was due to the acquisition of new customers like the omni hotel and the full year impact of existing customers like wolfgang puck fine dining and anton airfoods 
in the other channels  including online and mail order  office coffee  and kiosk operations  the sales increase was entirely attributable to the full year impact of our kiosk operations in larry s markets 
cost of sales and related occupancy expenses cost of sales and related occupancy expenses consist of product costs  including hedging costs  manufacturing costs  rent and other occupancy costs 
primarily as a result of increased net revenue and the addition of five new stores  cost of sales increased by in as a percent of net revenue  cost of sales decreased mainly because of lower coffee costs  lower world commodity coffee prices and the sales of special lot and seasonal coffees  which have a higher margin than regular menu coffees 
these benefits were partially offset by the increase in revenue from the specialty sales segment  which has a lower price point than retail and higher shipping and packaging costs 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased as compared to as we grew our business 
however  operating expenses as a percent of net revenue decreased primarily due to the continued productivity initiative affecting our retail stores and the revenue increase in our specialty sales segment  which has lower operating expenses without the intensive labor component of the retail stores 
our focus on growing the specialty sales segment led to an increase in specialty sales operating expenses as a percent of segment revenue 
the factors contributing to the increase included the continued upgrade and addition of specialty sales staff and an increase in consulting and distribution costs in the grocery channel 
marketing and advertising expenses the decrease in marketing and advertising expenses in as compared to is attributable to the leverage gained from marketing across multiple channels of distribution  as well as the shift in spending to improve store operations  recognizing that stores are our most valuable marketing tool 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by in as the result of higher expenses in the areas of stock plan administration  public relations and proxy related activities  higher insurance coverage for directors and officers  and our ceo search 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in due primarily to certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year 
in addition  while we opened three more stores than  depreciation expense was minimally impacted as most of the stores were opened in the fourth quarter 
interest income expense  net net interest income was generated in from the investment of the proceeds of our april follow on public offering of common stock 
the investments are short and long term interest bearing  us government and agency securities 
income tax provision taxes on net income in were million  reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective rate over the prior year is attributable to the change in the valuation allowance of charitable contributions carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments totaled million 
also  we had million of working capital 
net cash provided by operations was million in compared to million in operating cash flows were positively impacted in by increased net income and the tax benefit from the increased exercise of stock options and higher accounts payable balances 
net cash used in investing activities was million in investing activities primarily consisted of the net proceeds of million of short term investments and long term us government and agency securities  and million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures included million used for the buildout of new stores and remodel of existing stores  million used for dsd vans and equipment for specialty sales  million used for manufacturing plant capacity and additional machinery  and million used for web development  information technology support systems  and software to support our growing infrastructure 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in financing activities in consisted primarily of million in exercise of stock options  offset by million of repayment of debt 
we have a credit facility with general electric capital corporation that provides for a revolving line of credit of million that expires in at december   there was no outstanding balance and million available under the revolving line of credit after other senior funded debt of million  consisting of capital leases 
see note borrowings in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
our capital expenditure requirements consist primarily of expenditures relating to new store openings  remodeling of existing stores  upgrade of our packaging system  and continued improvement of our data processing capabilities 
our capital expenditures are expected to be between and million 
approximately to million is expected to be used for the opening of to new retail stores scheduled for and expenditures for new stores in progress for approximately million is expected to be used for purchase of new packaging and roasting equipment 
the remaining million is expected to be used for the remodeling of existing stores  equipment for the grocery channel  and information technology enhancements 
we are exploring capacity and office space needs as we continue to grow our business 
our lease for our corporate office and plant facilities expire in and we have an option to extend the lease for an additional ten years 
we believe that in we will need additional production and office space that will exceed our current facilities 
we are in the process of exploring alternatives including but not limited to extending of the existing lease with additional leasing of production  warehouse  and office spaces

     fixed price coffee purchase commitments    total contractual cash obligations      for the next twelve months  we expect our cash flows from operations and cash and investments to be sufficient for our operating and capital requirements  our share repurchase program  and our contractual obligations as they come due 
other business opportunities or store expansion rates substantially in excess of those presently planned may require outside funding 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operation in recent years 
however  we cannot predict what effect inflation may have on our results of operation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess cash in money market accounts  short term investments and long term us government and agency securities 
these financial instruments are all subject to fluctuations of daily interest rates 
therefore our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from these changes 
the supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility and can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries  including weather  political and economic conditions 
in addition  green coffee bean prices have been affected in the past  and may be affected in the future  by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence commodity prices of green coffee beans through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies worldwide 
our coffee hedging strategy is intended to limit the cost exposure of the main commodity used in our business  green coffee beans 
we use fixed price purchase commitments  coffee futures  and coffee futures options to manage coffee supply and price risk 
fixed price purchase commitments we enter into fixed price purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee beans and fix our cost of green coffee beans 
these commitments are made with established coffee brokers and are denominated in us dollars 
as of december   we had approximately million in open fixed priced purchase commitments with delivery dates ranging from january through november we believe  based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past that the risk of non delivery on such purchase commitments is low 
coffee futures and futures options we use coffee futures and futures options to reduce the price risk of our coffee purchase requirements that we cannot make or have not made on a contractual basis 
these instruments are traded on the new york coffee  sugar cocoa exchange 
we use these futures and options solely for financial hedging purposes and never take actual delivery of the coffee traded on the exchange 
the extent of our coffee futures and coffee futures options positions at any given time depends on the amount of coffee we have contracted to purchase  the amount of coffee qualified for hedge accounting  and general market conditions and trends 
our hedging positions are only placed by the chief financial officer through one brokerage firm that we believe to be reputable 
as of december   we held no coffee futures or futures options 
the following table reflects the outstanding coffee futures hedging positions as of december  we had no outstanding positions at december contract trade settlement number of contracts month price price gain loss may 















 unrealized gain as of december   these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are accounted for as inventory costs and are recorded as expense or income when the related coffee is sold 
the ineffective portion is recorded as an expense or income immediately 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements during april  the fasb issued sfas no

the revision of fin further defines and narrows the scope of the variable interest entity as well as defers the effective date of the guidance to the first quarter of the adoption of fin is not expected to have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
risk factors we may not be successful in the implementation of our business strategy or our business strategy may not be successful  either of which will impede our growth and operating results 
our business strategy emphasizes expansion through multiple channels of distribution 
currently  our retail stores  which generated nearly of our net revenue  continue to be an important element of our business 
we do not know whether we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy or whether our business strategy will be successful 
our ability to implement this business strategy is dependent on our ability to market our products on a national or international scale and over the internet  enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third party retailers and other potential distributors of our coffee  increase our brand recognition on a national and international scale  identify and lease strategic locations suitable for new stores  and manage growth in administrative overhead and distribution costs likely to result from the planned expansion of our retail and non retail distribution channels 
our revenue may be adversely affected if we fail to implement our business strategy or if we divert resources to a business strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful 
because our business is highly dependent on a single product  specialty coffee  if the demand for specialty coffee decreases  our business could suffer 
sales of specialty coffee constituted nearly of our net revenue 
demand for specialty coffee is affected by many factors  including consumer tastes and preferences  national  regional and local economic conditions  and demographic trends 
because we are highly dependent on consumer demand for specialty coffee  a shift in consumer preferences away from specialty coffee would harm our business more than if we had more diversified product offerings 
if customer demand for specialty coffee decreases  our sales would decrease accordingly 
if we fail to continue to develop and maintain our brand  our business could suffer 
we believe that maintaining and developing our brand is critical to our success and that the importance of brand recognition may increase as a result of competitors offering products similar to ours 
because the majority of our retail stores are located on the west coast  primarily in california  our brand recognition remains largely regional 
our brand building initiative involves increasing the availability of our products and opening new stores to increase awareness of our brand and create and maintain brand loyalty 
if our brand building initiative is unsuccessful  we may never recover the expenses incurred in connection with these efforts and we may be unable to increase our future revenue or implement our business strategy 
our success in promoting and enhancing the peet s brand will also depend on our ability to provide customers with high quality products and customer service 
although we take measures to ensure that we sell only fresh roasted whole bean coffee and that our retail employees properly prepare our coffee beverages  we have no control over our whole bean coffee products once purchased by customers 
accordingly  customers may prepare coffee from our whole bean coffee inconsistent with our standards  store our whole bean coffee for long periods of time or resell our whole bean coffee without our consent  which in each case  potentially affects the quality of the coffee prepared from our products 
if customers do not perceive our products and service to be of high quality  then the value of our brand may be diminished and  consequently  our ability to implement our business strategy may be adversely affected 
because our business is based primarily in california  a worsening of economic conditions  a decrease in consumer spending or a change in the competitive conditions in this market may substantially decrease our revenue and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our california retail stores generated of our net revenue and a substantial portion of the revenue from our other distribution channels is generated in california 
we expect that our california operations will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenue 
in addition  our california retail stores provide us with means for increasing brand awareness  building customer loyalty and creating a premium specialty coffee brand 
as a result  an economic downturn or other decrease in consumer spending in california may not only lead to a substantial decrease in revenue  but may also adversely impact our ability to market our brand  build customer loyalty  or otherwise implement our business strategy 
the grocery workers strike in southern california has ended  however  a similar strike in other regions could negatively impact our grocery business 
the southern california grocery workers strike impacted safeway  albertson s  and ralph s 
we sell coffee to each of these supermarkets in the area as well as in other regions in the western united states 
if a similar strike were to occur in other regions such as northern california and the pacific northwest  where we have the majority of our distribution  our grocery revenue could be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to continue leasing our retail locations or obtain leases for new stores  our existing operations and our ability to expand may be adversely affected 
all of our retail locations are on leased premises 
if we are unable to renew these leases  our revenue and profits could suffer 
in addition  we intend to lease other premises in connection with the planned expansion of our retail operations 
because we compete with other retailers and restaurants for store sites and some landlords may grant exclusive locations to our competitors  we may not be able to obtain new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms 
this could adversely impact our revenue growth and brand building initiatives 
because we rely heavily on common carriers to ship our coffee on a daily basis  any disruption in their services or increase in shipping costs could adversely affect our business 
we rely on a number of common carriers to deliver coffee to our customers and retail stores 
we consider roasted coffee a perishable product and we rely on these common carriers to deliver fresh roasted coffee on a daily basis 
we have no control over these common carriers and the services provided by them may be interrupted as a result of labor shortages  contract disputes or other factors 
if we experience an interruption in these services  we may be unable to ship our coffee in a timely manner 
a delay in shipping could have an adverse impact on the quality of the coffee shipped  and thereby adversely affect our brand and reputation  result in the disposal of an amount of coffee that could not be shipped in a timely manner  and require us to contract with alternative  and possibly more expensive  common carriers 
any significant increase in shipping costs could lower our profit margins or force us to raise prices  which could cause our revenue and profits to suffer 
we depend on the expertise of key personnel 
if these individuals leave or change their role within our company without effective replacements  our operations may suffer 
the success of our business is dependent to a large degree on our management and our coffee roasters and purchasers 
if members of our management leave without effective replacements  our ability to implement our business strategy could be impaired 
if we lost the services of our coffee roasters and purchasers  our ability to source and purchase a sufficient supply of high quality coffee beans and roast coffee beans consistent with our quality standards could suffer 
in either case  our business and operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to hire or retain additional management and other personnel and our recruiting and training costs may increase as a result of turnover  both of which may increase our costs and reduce our profits and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified management and other personnel  including technical personnel and retail employees 
we face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees 
our ability to execute our business strategy may suffer if we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially  or the costs of outsourcing certain tasks to third party providers increase substantially 
we expend significant resources in training our retail managers and employees 
during the past few years  retail employee turnover has increased to approximately per year 
if turnover continues to increase  we may incur additional recruiting and training costs 
because we have only one roasting facility  a significant interruption in the operation of this facility could potentially disrupt our operations 
we have only one coffee roasting and distribution facility 
a significant interruption in the operation of this facility  whether as a result of a natural disaster or other causes  could significantly impair our ability to operate our business 
moreover  our roasting and distribution facility and most of our stores are located near several major earthquake faults 
the impact of a major earthquake on our facilities  infrastructure and overall operations is difficult to predict and an earthquake could seriously disrupt our entire business 
our earthquake insurance covers net income  continuing normal operating expenses and extra expenses incurred during the period of restoration 
however  in the event of a catastrophic earthquake  our coverage is limited and we would incur additional expenses 
we have a high deductible workers compensation insurance program and more claims and higher costs from these claims may adversely affect our profit 
our current workers compensation insurance program is a modified self insured program with a high deductible with an overall program ceiling to limit exposure 
the california workers compensation environment has been unpredictable with continually increasing costs in the past five years 
the majority of our business is in california  therefore  we are exposed to the same increased costs 
additionally  we have had to estimate our liability for existing claims whose outcome is uncertain 
while we believe our reserve methodology on these claims is appropriate today  unfavorable development in this area will also affect any open claims that were filed beginning march  the date we transitioned to a high deductible program 
should a greater amount of claims occur or the settlement costs increase beyond what was anticipated  our expenses could increase and our profitability may decrease 
increases in the cost and decreases in availability of high quality arabica coffee beans could impact our profitability and growth of our business 
coffee prices are currently near historical lows and we believe they are likely to increase in the future 
coffee is a trade commodity and  in general  its price can fluctuate depending on weather patterns in coffee producing countries  economic and political conditions affecting coffee producing countries  foreign currency fluctuations  and the ability of coffee producing countries to agree to export quotas 
if the cost of our green coffee beans increases due to any of these or other factors impacting us negatively  we many not be able to pass along those costs to our customers because of the competitive nature of the specialty coffee industry 
if we are unable to pass along increased coffee costs  our margin will decrease and our profitability will suffer accordingly 
if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of high quality arabica beans due to any of the above factors  we many not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee  our revenue may decrease and our ability to expand our business may also suffer 
our roasting methods are not proprietary  so competitors may be able to duplicate them  which could harm our competitive position 
we consider our roasting methods essential to the flavor and richness of our roasted whole bean coffee and  therefore  essential to our brand 
because we do not hold any patents for our roasting methods  it may be difficult for us to prevent competitors from copying our roasting methods 
if our competitors copy our roasting methods  the value of our brand may be diminished  and we may lose customers to our competitors 
in addition  competitors may be able to develop roasting methods that are more advanced than our roasting methods  which may also harm our competitive position 
competition in the specialty coffee market is intense and could affect our profitability 
competition in the specialty coffee market is becoming increasingly intense as relatively low barriers to entry encourage new competitors to enter the specialty coffee market 
our whole bean specialty coffee competes with several major national brands  such as gevalia kraft foods  green mountain coffee  illy caffe  millstone procter gamble  seattle s best starbucks and starbucks  as well as numerous smaller  regional brands 
in addition  we compete indirectly against all other coffee brands on the market 
a number of nationwide coffee marketers  such as kraft foods  procter gamble and nestle  are distributing premium coffee brands in supermarkets 
these premium coffee brands may serve as substitutes for our whole bean coffee 
in addition to competing with other distributors of whole bean coffee  we compete with retailers of prepared beverages  including coffee house chains  particularly starbucks  numerous convenience stores  restaurants  coffee shops and street vendors 
if we do not succeed in effectively differentiating ourselves from our competitors or our competitors adopt our strategies  then our competitive position will be weakened 
despite competing in a fragmented product category  whole bean specialty coffee brands are being established across multiple distribution channels 
several competitors have been aggressive in obtaining distribution in specialty grocery and gourmet food stores  through online and mail order and in office  restaurant and food service locations 
we have only recently begun to penetrate these channels 
other competitors may have an advantage over us based on their earlier entry into these distribution channels 
many of these new market entrants may have substantially greater financial  marketing and operating resources than us 
in addition  many of our existing competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and operating resources than us 
lawsuits and other claims against the company may adversely affect our profitability 
we may from time to time become involved in certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  such as the two lawsuits filed in against us entitled brian taraz  et al 
vs 
peet s coffee tea  inc  and tracy coffee  et al 
vs 
peet s coffee tea  inc in investigating any claims against the company or defending any allegations  we may incur legal fees  settlement fees  damages or remediation expenses that may harm our business  reducing our sales and adversely affecting our profitability 
further  while the superior court has granted preliminary approval to the settlement of the lawsuits brought by taraz et al  the settlement remains subject to the court s final approval  our right to terminate if more than of the settlement class opts out of the settlement  and the plaintiffs right to terminate if claims by class members in the aggregate exceed more than of the number of work weeks specified in the settlement agreement  and may therefore never be consummated 
adverse public or medical opinion about caffeine may harm our business 
our specialty coffee contains significant amounts of caffeine and other active compounds  the health effects of some of which are not fully understood 
a number of research studies conclude or suggest that excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to increased heart rate  nausea and vomiting  restlessness and anxiety  depression  headaches  tremors  sleeplessness and other adverse health effects 
an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in coffee could significantly reduce the demand for coffee  which could harm our business and reduce our sales and profits 
adverse publicity regarding customer complaints may harm our business 
we may be the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging beverage and food related illnesses  injuries suffered on the premises or other quality  health or operational concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially adversely affect us  regardless of whether such allegations are true or whether we are ultimately held liable
