overview the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the exploration company is an independent oil and gas enterprise with interests primarily in the maverick basin in southwest texas 
its long term business strategy is to build shareholder value by acquiring undeveloped mineral interests and internally developing a multi year drilling inventory through the use of advanced technologies  such as d seismic and horizontal drilling 
the company accounts for its oil and gas operations under the successful efforts method of accounting and trades its common stock on the nasdaq stock market sm under the symbol txco 
the company currently has three drilling rigs under operation on its extensive  acre block in the maverick basin  targeting at least seven separate formations for the production of oil and natural gas  but has had as many as seven rigs operating during targeting separate formations 
current emphasis is on the georgetown formation where the company has experienced a recent string of seven success ful gas completions 
the capital expenditures budget includes funds for new wells in the georgetown formation and four re entries  as well as funds for completion of a number of wells in progress at year end and for infrastructure improvements 
due to the availability of many promising prospects on our maverick basin acreage  and higher and more stable oil and gas prices  drilling activity was substantially increased for over prior year levels 
for further discussion of this activity  see the 
principal areas of activity and 
drilling activity sections of this form k 
the resulting increased expenditures should translate into increased reserves after an adequate production history is established 
additional revenues and increased credit capacity for future activity should also follow the increased drilling activity 
recognition of additional reserves on newly drilled wells requires a period of sustained production  causing a delay between the expenditures and the recording of reserves 
txco reported a net income of  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
major contributors to this improvement were higher average sales prices and increased production  both on a per bcfe basis 
offsetting these improvements were increases in impairment  depreciation and depletion  and interest expense 
these factors are discussed in the 
results of operations section 
txco achieved significant progress in many key areas of operations and record drilling activity during current year results include a drill bit reserve replacement rate and a bcfe increase in reserves 
including an acquisition of bcfe reserves  txco s all sources reserve replacement rate was 
positive cash flow provided from operations totaled million  a increase over the prior year

the company s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties  repayment of contractual obligations and working capital funding 
txco has historically addressed its long term liquidity requirements through cash provided by operating activities  the issuance of equity securities when market conditions permit  sale of non strategic assets  and more recently through the 
credit facility and issuance of 
redeemable preferred stock 
the prices for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have significant impacts on operating cash flows and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
management continues to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  the sales of non strategic assets  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  txco s ability to execute its operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond its control 
management believes that projected operating cash flows  cash on hand  and borrowings under the credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the requirements of txco s business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and natural gas prices 
no assurances can be made that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to drilling results  product pricing and future acquisition and divestitures of properties 
bank credit facility on march   the company entered into a million oil and gas reserve based revolving credit facility with hibernia national bank providing a credit line with an initial borrowing base set at million 
the borrowing base was subsequently increased based on increased oil and gas reserves and amendments were made during that modified the covenant terms and extended the termination date 
at december   the borrowing base was million  which was fully utilized  compared with a borrowing base of million  with borrowings of million  and unused borrowing capacity of million at december  interest is payable monthly  with principal due at maturity in march proceeds are used for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and general corporate working capital purposes 
the facility provides the lender with semiannual scheduled redeterminations  at mid year and each subsequent anniversary date  while providing for two un scheduled redeterminations per year  at the company s discretion 
borrowings under the facility are secured by a first priority mortgage covering the company s working and other interests in the majority of its oil and gas leases 
the facility also provides the lender with a commitment fee equal to per annum on the unused borrowing base 
the facility contains certain financial covenants and other negative restrictions common for a financing of this type 
at december   the company was not in compliance with the current ratio covenant 
the company received a waiver related to this covenant for the december  and march  reporting periods  and expects to be in compliance with the covenant at june  and subsequent periods 
accordingly  the credit facility is classified as long term 
the interest rate under the facility  during and  was based on the wall street journal prime rate plus applicable margin base rate 
a eurodollar rate plus applicable margin may be utilized at the election of the company 
the interest rate at december   was 
the agreement was amended effective december   to provide for two tranches with separate repayment terms and interest rates 
tranche a has similar interest terms to the original agreement  with lower applicable margins on the eurodollar rate option  and applies to the first million of borrowings 
tranche b will apply to borrowings above million and bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
any borrowings then outstanding under tranche b will be payable on january  at march   the outstanding balance was million and the unused borrowing base was million 
the rates in effect at march   were on million of borrowi ngs  and on the excess over million 
capital requirements outlook overall management believes that the company s positive cash flow from existing production and anticipated production increases from new drilling  along with the credit facility  will provide adequate capital to fund operating cash requirements and complete its scheduled exploration and development goals as targeted by its capital expenditure program for the company expects it will be able to further increase its borrowing base commensurate with the expected additional growth of its proved oil and gas reserves throughout the base term of the facility 
while management believes it has identified sufficient sources of working capital to fund its planned activities through the end of the coming year  there is no assurance that energy prices or other market factors will remain favorable 
should prices weaken  or expected new oil and gas production levels not be attained  the resulting reduction in projected revenues would cause the company to re evaluate its working capital options and would adversely affect the company s ability to carry out its current operating plans 
the major components of the company s plans  and the requirements for additional capital for  include the following maverick basin activity initial capital expenditures of million planned for target the company s maverick basin core properties 
the primary component of these expenditures is million for drilling wells 
over million is earmarked for seismic  leasehold  and gas gathering system enhancements and other infrastructure expansion activities 
the company s budgeted capital expenditures are intended to be flexible 
the budget may expand or contract based on drilling results  operational developments  unanticipated transaction opportunities  market conditions  commodity price fluctuations and working capital availability 
the company plans to drill or re enter wells  including georgetown gas wells  glen rose porosity zone oil wells  san miguel waterflood oil wells  and eight glen rose horizontal shoal or reef gas wells 
other companies will operate some of these wells and  therefore  txco does not have direct control over when they will be drilled or what final costs will actually be incurred 
the following table details typical gross well costs budgeted for wells typical gross well costs dry hole completed glen rose oil porosity zone horizontal well glen rose shoal horizontal gas well glen rose reef vertical gas well georgetown gas well southern georgetown gas well northern san miguel waterflood oil well williston basin activity the company plans to maintain its existing producing properties and the payment of delay rentals and lease extensions on selected undeveloped leases  with scheduled delay rentals of  txco will continue in its efforts to offer remaining acreage  seismic data  and identified prospects to other industry operators 
txco participated in two farm outs during and anticipates additional activity during sources and uses of cash for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for  up or million  from million for total cash available from all sources  listed in the following table  provided million for use in the ongoing expansion  development and exploration of the company s oil and gas properties 
this represents a increase over the million total cash available for included in cash from other sources for were funds raised from a private placement of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and common stock

uses of cash drilling and completion costs  d seismic  and leasehold acquisitions other property and equipment sub total debt principal payments cash utilized the company made timely payments of million  excluding million paid and later reborrowed on its credit facility  on its long term debt obligations during  while payments of interest totaled million 
as a result of these activities  the company ended the year with a current ratio of to and a negative working capital of million  compared with to and negative million  respectively  at december  the credit facility was amended during to modify the current ratio covenant and waive the violation at june  second amendment  as well as  extend the maturity date to march and provide for two tranches third amendment 
the company also received a permanent waiver for the march  violation of the current ratio covenant 
copies of these amendments are filed as exhibits to this document 
burr ranch acquisition in january  the company acquired the  acre burr ranch lease 
the acreage is contiguous to its existing acreage block and the company believes it has excellent potential to establish production from the glen rose  georgetown and jurassic intervals 
the company entered into an unsecured installment obligation with the mineral owner in connection with this acquisition 
imputed interest due on the obligation is per annum 
subsequent to year end  a second installment of million was made 
a final installment of million is due in january sources and uses of cash for the year ended december  during  cash from all sources  listed below  resulted in total cash of million available for use in meeting the company s ongoing operational and development needs 
included in the cash received from other sources  are funds raised from a private placement of  shares of restricted common stock to a group of institutional investors 
the amount raised was used for acquisitions  to accelerate the development of the company s extensive maverick basin acreage holdings and for general corporate purposes 
pursuant to the placement agreement  the company filed a form s registration statement dated june   covering the issued shares on behalf of the investors

credit facility other debt obligations exercise of outstanding options for the company s common stock proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties total other sources of cash cash available the company applied million to fund the expansion and ongoing development of its oil and gas properties  primarily targeting txco s core area 
this included expenditures for the drilling  completion and re entry of oil and gas wells and the acquisition of maverick basin mineral leases  and the acquisition of a mile pipeline system 
the pipeline system gathers most of the company s natural gas in the maverick basin 
the following table summarizes uses of cash during uses of cash drilling and completion costs  d seismic  and leasehold acquisitions natural gas gathering system and facilities pena creek acquisition and improvements well service equipment upgrade information system and related infrastructure other sub total net distributions to minority interests debt principal payments cash utilized the company made timely payments of  on its long term debt obligations during  while payments on interest totaled  pipeline acquisitions in may  the company completed the acquisition of the maverick pipeline system from aquila southwest pipeline corporation for a total purchase price of million 
txco s initial interest million was purchased through its newly formed maverick dimmit pipeline  ltd 
partnership the partnership 
the remaining of the partnership was held by an unaffiliated private energy concern 
this acquisition was funded with proceeds from a million private placement also closed in may 
in june  the partnership acquired an additional miles of pipeline from txco s owned subsidiary  the paloma pipeline lp  for million 
during the third quarter  the partnership began construction of a mile   pipeline extension to connect the company s growing chittim lease production to the pipeline system 
this extension was placed in service early in the fourth quarter 
during the fourth quarter  txco consolidated its position by acquiring the outstanding minority interest in maverick dimmit pipeline  ltd  at its book value of million 
the consolidation was funded through txco s available credit facility 
pena creek acquisition also in may  the company acquired the pena creek oil field in dimmit county  texas  from merit energy company for million 
the purchase was effective april  the acquisition consisted of producing oil wells  injection wells and shut in wells 
as a result of these activities  the company ended the year with a negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to this year end position compares to negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to at december  the company ended with an unused borrowing base of million 
results of operations the following table highlights the percentage change from the preceding year for selected items that are significant in our industry

revenues for increased by million compared to production increased on a bcfe basis  from bcfe in to bcfe in oil production increased by mbbl while natural gas production declined by mmcf as compared with the prior year 
the increase in oil production is due to the new glen rose oil wells drilled during  as well as a full year of production from the pena creek field acquired in may the decline in gas production compared to the prior year reflects the general production decline of the company s existing mix of maturing gas wells 
this decline was partially offset by gas production from the new gas wells drilled and completed during the year 
three new gas wells came on production in the fourth quarter 
the vivian began producing in october and had produced  bo and  mcf of gas by year end 
the kothman produced bo and  mcf of gas in its seven days of operation in the myers began production on december at a rate of  mcfd 
included in the number of gas wells classified as producing at december   were cbm gas wells  which are still in their initial dewatering stage  and are not yet contributing a significant amount of new gas production 
on an equivalent unit basis  prices averaged higher in as compared to crude oil prices averaged higher while natural gas prices rose 
average higher prices for  as compared to  had a million positive impact on revenues in commodity prices have been and continue to be volatile 
during  realized gas prices ranged from a high of per mcf in november to a low of per mcf in february 
during realized natural gas prices ranged from a high of per mcf in march to a low of per mcf in november 
average daily net gas production rates in decreased to mmcf  a decline from the prior year  while average daily net oil production rates in increased to  bbls  up over the prior year 
the company hopes to reverse the declining natural gas production rates based on its year drilling success to date  fourth quarter georgetown wells and expected results from ongoing drilling projects 
at february   average daily net production included mmcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil 
lease operating expense loe for increased  from million in to million in  an increase 
this increase is primarily due to the addition of new natural gas wells and new oil wells during and a full year of operations on the active pena creek wells acquired in mid the increase reflects the incremental direct costs of operating the new wells  including typical costs such as pumper  electricity  water disposal  and other direct overhead charges  as added during to the company s existing lease operating expense levels 
operating expense  which adds production taxes to loe  per mcfe increased from in to in the increase in the rate reflects a full year of pena creek field operations  which consists of three waterflood units 
typically  waterfloods incur higher costs of operations 
excluding the pena creek field  operating expense per mcfe for is 
also  included in operating cos ts is the cost of operating the cbm wells 
these costs totaled  in and  in the cbm wells are in the dewatering phase and therefore have little production relative to their operating costs 
operating cost per mcfe excluding the cbm wells and pena creek averaged in and in pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing and non producing properties for impairment 
impairment and abandonments increased by over primarily due to higher impairment on producing properties  as production from new plays  such as the glen rose oil porosity  have not established the production rates that were expected 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by over million  or  over due primarily to the increased number of producing wells being depleted  for wells added through the drill bit and a full year activity for the pena creek wells acquired in may also contributing to the increase in depreciation is the first full year of depreciation on the pipeline and well service equipment acquired in mid the company s gas gathering system is generally expected to operate on a break even basis 
the gas is sold at several points along the system with a significant portion being delivered to purchasers through the el paso gulf terra pipeline system el paso 
the gas delivered through el paso is processed by el paso to remove natural gas liquids  which are marketed separately by el paso 
the company receives a share of the revenues for these liquids 
natural gas pricing fluctuations are reflected at the wellhead for the company s operated gas properties 
due to the acquisition of the company s primary gas gathering assets in may of  comparisons of to are not meaningful 
during the current year  the company s gas gathering system revenues rose million  while expense rose million 
costs to purchase third party gas along the company s gathering system totaled million  while associated transportation and marketing expenses required to market th at gas were  and direct operating costs of the pipeline were  sharply higher gas prices in late february  combined with an erroneous gas nomination earlier that month  resulted in a one time trading loss of approximately  in the first quarter 
management has determined the trading loss was an isolated incident and has refined its internal procedures to prevent a similar reoccurrence 
while general and administrative costs increased when compared to levels  they were of revenues 
this compares favorably to when general and administrative expenses were of revenues 
the higher level of absolute dollar costs reflects the higher sustained level of company operations  and is primarily attributable to higher salaries  wages and benefits and office related expenses associated with new full time employees across the organization during  as well as increased directors fees 
also contributing to the increase were higher costs for property and liability insurance 
in addition  increases in general and administrative costs are consistent with the expanded compliance burden mandated by the adoption of the sarbanes oxley act in mid these particular costs are likely to increase significantly in the decrease in interest income reflects the low average cash levels in interest bearing accounts 
interest expense increased by million in from due to higher debt levels  reflecting the 
redeemable preferred stock issuance and higher average balances on the credit facility 
a portion of the interest expense is an accrual reflecting the accretion of the liability on the preferred stock to its full redemption value  which is classified as a long term liability on the balance sheet 
compared to the company reported a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
revenues for increased by compared to oil production increased by while natural gas production declined by as compared with the prior year 
the increase in oil production is due to the new comanche lease oil wells  along with production from the may acquisition of the pena creek field 
the decline in gas production compared to the prior year reflects the general production decline of the company s existing mix of maturing gas wells 
this decline was partially offset by new gas production from the new gas wells drilled and completed during the year

operating cost per mcfe excluding the cbm wells and pena creek averaged in and in pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing and non producing properties for impairment 
impairment and abandonments decreased by primarily due to lower impairment rates on non producing acreage in the williston basin during versus depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by almost million  or  over due primarily to the increased number of producing wells being depleted for wells added through the drill bit and the pena creek acquisition 
the increase in depreciation was due to increased investments in other equipment including the pipeline and well service equipment acquisitions 
the increase in amortization was primarily due to the full year amortization related to the d seismic survey on the comanche lease acquired during general and administrative costs remained at approximately of revenues  while increasing compared to reflecting the higher sustained level of company operations 
the increase is due primarily to higher salaries  wages and benefits associated with staff increases including six engineering and administrative staff additions and eight new field personnel during also contributing to the increase were higher costs for property and liability insurance and increased investor relations expenses 
the decrease in interest income reflects the declining cash levels in interest bearing accounts and declining interest rates during versus interest expense increased by  in from due to higher debt levels 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of the company s future payments on obligations as of december  payments due by period after contractual obligations year years years years total long term debt redeemable preferred stock operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in 
note a to the audited financial statements 
certain of these policies are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to reserves  depletion and impairment of oil and gas properties  and the ultimate utilization of the deferred tax asset  and base our estimates on historical experience and various othe r assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells  costs to acquire mineral interests and d seismic costs are capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses including d seismic costs and delay rentals for oil and gas leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and ultimately deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment or recompletion of the wells at later dates 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these co sts with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when the company is entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding an oil and gas field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of oil and gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and w orkover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures  with respect to the company s reserves  will likely vary from estimates and such variances may be material 
txco contracts with netherland sewell associate s  a dallas based engineering firm to provide reserve estimates for reporting purposes 
impairment of oil and gas properties the company reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment at least annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require the company to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with oil and gas properties 
the company has recognized impairments in prior years and there can be no assurance that impairments will not be required in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes on its operations 
when recording income tax expense or benefit  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of the calendar year  b tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses or benefits are recognized 
the company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when management believes that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized  or if likely realization may be many years in the future 
the company s deferred tax assets exceeded its liabilities at december   and based on the company s projected profitability  a valuation allowance was recorded of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  resulting in a net deferred tax asset at each respective year end of million 
although the company believes the valuation allowance and resulting deferred tax asset is reasonable  the ultimate recoverability or utilization of the asset is subject to change in future years for reasons explained above 
new accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

this statement requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability because the financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and requires reclassification of existing financial instruments in financial statements for the first interim period beginning after june  the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock discussed in 
note e to the audited financial statements has been recorded as a liability as a result of this statement 
the fasb and representatives of the accounting staff of the securities and exchange commission are currently engaged in discussions regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the fasb and the sec staff are considering whether the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
require registrants to classify costs associated with mineral rights  including both proved and unproved lease acquisition costs  as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  the company has included oil and gas lease acquisition bonus payments as a component of oil and gas properties 
in the event the fasb and sec staff determine that costs associated with mineral rights are required to be classified as intangible assets  a portion of the company s oil and gas property acquisition costs may be required to be separately classified on its balance sheets as intangible assets or further described in footnote disclosures 
however  the company currently believes that its results of operations and financial condition would not be materially affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with existing successful efforts accounting rules and impairment standards 
the company does not believe the classification of oil and gas lease acquisition costs as intangible assets would have any impact on the company s compliance with covenants under its debt agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
prices have fluctuated significantly over the last five years and such volatility is expected to continue  and the range of such price movement is not predictable with any degree of certainty 
during  the company was party to a forward sale of approximately  mmbtu per day of its natural gas production from february   through december   at a fixed price of per mmbtu
