the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
overview we help clients improve business and it effectiveness through outsourcing services 
we plan  build  and manage application software through our business consulting  ad i  and application outsourcing services 
we develop long term relationships with customers by providing a broad range of service offerings delivered on a local basis 
we also optimize clients internal processes through bpo services through worldzen  our majority owned subsidiary 
our it services are delivered through an integrated network of local branch offices in north america  the uk  and through adcs in the us  canada  and india 
this global delivery model enables us to provide our services to customers onsite  at our nearshore facilities in canada  and through our offshore development centers in india 
our centralized strategic practices and our quality assurance groups support branch offices 
the practices focus on developing repeatable approaches to common customer needs and challenges  and help to gather and institutionalize our best practices 
we believe that our blend of onsite  nearshore  and offshore capabilities enables us to further improve the efficiency and economic advantage of the services that we provide our customers 
in order for us to remain successful in the near term  we must continue to maintain and grow our client base  provide high quality service and satisfaction to our existing clients  and take advantage of cross selling opportunities 
in the current economic environment  we must provide our clients with service offerings that are appropriately priced  satisfy their needs  and provide them with measurable business benefit 
we believe that maximizing the generation of cash from our operations is fundamental to building long term per share value 
we believe that selling and delivering application outsourcing and cross selling our other services is critical to our long term success 
attracting  retaining  motivating  and developing talented sales  management  and technical professionals is another essential component to our success 
in addition  our ability to leverage sg a expenses over a broader base of revenue is crucial to increasing net income and cash provided from operations 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as services are performed or products are delivered in accordance with contractual agreements and generally accepted accounting principles 
for general consulting engagements  revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis as services are delivered 
for the majority of our outsourcing engagements  we provide a specific level of service each month for which we bill a standard monthly fee 
revenue for these engagements is recognized in monthly installments over the billable portion of the contract 
these installments may be adjusted to reflect changes in staffing requirements and service levels consistent with terms of the contract 
costs of transitioning the employees and ensuring we meet required service level agreements may be capitalized over defined periods of time 
for fixed price engagements  revenue is recognized on a proportional performance basis over the life of the contract 
we use estimated labor to complete to measure the proportional performance 
proportional performance recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope  and duration of each engagement 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  then future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
revenue associated with application software products is recognized as the software products are installed and as implementation services are delivered 
software maintenance fees on installed products are recognized on a pro rated basis over the term of the agreement 
in all consulting engagements  outsourcing engagements  and software application sales  the risk of issues associated with satisfactory service delivery exists 
although we believe these risks are adequately addressed by our adherence to proven project management methodologies  proprietary frameworks  and internal project audits  the potential exists for future revenue charges relating to service delivery issues 
historically  we have not experienced major service delivery issues 
allowance for bad debts each accounting period  we evaluate accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments or unresolved issues with the adequacy of our services 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue in the period the risk is identified 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future reductions to revenue 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
as of december   our goodwill totaled million 
we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining whether an intangible asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset  and other related factors 
if the estimates or the related assumptions used to determine the value of the intangible assets change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of december   our intangible assets totaled million 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the tax benefits of certain subsidiary net operating losses and the minimum pension liability 
our policy is to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by the tax authorities 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  we establish the reserves based upon our assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and interest expense applicable to both permanent and temporary difference adjustments 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur to warrant the adjustment to the reserve 
stock based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the shares at the date of grant 
we also grant restricted stock for a fixed number of shares to employees for nominal consideration 
we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with apb  we recognize compensation expense based on the difference between the market value at grant date and the grant price and record the compensation expense ratably over the restriction period 
we do not recognize compensation expense on our stock option grants as the stock options are granted at the market price at the date of grant 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
had we adopted the accounting provisions of sfas  we would have recorded additional compensation expense and reduced net income by approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
restructuring we have recorded restructuring charges and reserves associated with restructuring plans approved by management in the last five years 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires us to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to exit or disposal plan exists 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and real estate lease obligations 
the reserve associated with lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as the ability to obtain subleases  the creditworthiness of our sub lessees  market value of properties  and the ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors 
while we believe that our current estimates regarding lease obligations are adequate  future events could require adjustments to these estimates 
based on the assumptions included in our analysis as of december   to the extent that we are unable to maintain all of our current  contractual subleases  we could incur an additional restructuring charge up to approximately million 
in addition  if we are able to negotiate early terminations of our operating leases or to obtain a sublessee  we would record a reduction to the restructuring liability and a corresponding expense reduction 
in  we recorded an expense reduction of million associated with early lease terminations and unanticipated subleases 
consolidated results of operations in this section  we discuss our results of operations 
we measure our revenue performance by comparing the growth in plan  build  and manage service revenues 
we evaluate our improvement in profitability by comparing gross margins  and sg a as a percentage of revenues 
other key metrics that we use to manage and evaluate the performance of our business include bookings or new sales to customers  the number of billable personnel  and utilization rates 
we calculate utilization rates by dividing the total billable hours per consultant by the total hours available from the consultant 
compared to revenues dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease plan    build    manage    total    revenues revenues in compared to decreased as a result of clients decisions to continue to defer discretionary technology related expenditures during a period of economic uncertainty 
however  throughout the course of the year  we experienced a more stable demand for our services and believe that we are beginning to see some indications of increases in discretionary it spending 
plan 
our plan service revenues are comprised primarily of business consulting services  which include business consulting and program management 
during  we provided the majority of our business consulting services through kcg 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered the growing bpo market through our acquisition of a majority interest in worldzen 
worldzen specializes in complex processes within the financial services  insurance  and healthcare industries  and provides back office processes for multiple industries 
as part of our investment in worldzen  we contributed to worldzen a majority of the assets and certain customer contracts associated with kcg 
our plan services are delivered via our global delivery model  from operations in the us  uk  canada  and india 
the decreases in plan service revenues were primarily the result of the deferral of consulting projects and a decrease in billing rates in response to weak general economic conditions 
build 
build service revenues  which consist primarily of the ad i business  were adversely affected during by customers decisions to defer software development projects due to the reduction in capital spending related to technology 
the products and services we sold within the less cyclical healthcare industry helped to stabilize build service revenues 
revenues for from hsd increased million  or compared to manage 
manage services consist primarily of application outsourcing services  together with staff augmentation  other maintenance and migration services  and bpo services  delivered through worldzen 
the decrease in manage service revenues was due to lower revenues associated with staff augmentation and other services  offset in part by an increase in application outsourcing revenues 
generally  under application outsourcing agreements  we receive a fixed monthly fee in return for meeting or exceeding a contractually agreed upon service level 
however  because our customers typically have the ability to reduce services under their contracts  our monthly fees may be reduced from the stated contract amounts 
for example  in accordance with the contract terms  pacificare has the ability to reduce the baseline resources as defined in the contract  which could potentially reduce the contract value  originally valued at approximately million through  by approximately million 
application outsourcing agreements generally do not require any capital outlay from us 
application outsourcing revenue and expenses are recognized on a monthly basis consistent with the service provided by us to our customers 
within our application outsourcing business  we carefully monitor and manage designated large  long term strategic application outsourcing engagements 
these deals represent application outsourcing contracts that have been signed since january of  with a minimum contract value of million in revenue 
we believe that these engagements are representative of the type of application outsourcing business that forms the core element of our growth strategy 
during  these long term strategic application outsourcing engagements generated million in revenue  a increase from million in revenue from these engagements in the following table summarizes certain line items from our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenues    salaries  wages  and other direct costs gross margin    gross margin salaries  wages  and other direct costs the decrease in salaries  wages  and other direct costs in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to ongoing efforts to bring our costs in alignment with anticipated revenues through workforce reductions and increased offshore staffing  primarily at our india facilities 
salaries  wages  and other direct costs were million  or  of total revenues  for and million  or  of total revenues in total billable employees for all operations were  at the end of  compared to  total billable employees at the end of in addition to these employees  we occasionally use subcontractors to augment our billable staff 
the base of billable employees within our india operation was at the end of  an increase of employees  or  compared to we added our india operation in march with our acquisition of signaltree solutions 
we closely monitor utilization rates  billable employees  and other direct costs in an effort to avoid adverse impacts to our gross margin 
gross margin we believe gross margin revenues less salaries  wages  and other direct costs provides an important measure of our profitability 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue for was  compared to in the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was largely the result of a more stable environment for it services and improved utilization related to our base of billable personnel in north america 
also contributing to the improvement in the gross margin percentage was our lower labor cost due to increased use of offshore resources at our india facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses include salaries for our corporate and branch administrative employees  sales and marketing expenses  as well as the cost of our administrative facilities  including related depreciation expense 
sg a expenses for decreased million  or  compared to sg a expenses for were million  or  of total revenue  compared to million  or  of total revenue for the decrease in sg a expenses in was the result of our fourth quarter of workforce reduction  our continued focus on tightly controlling discretionary expenses  and the cost synergies of fully integrating the acquisitions that we made in and amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in was primarily due to fully amortizing intangibles associated with prior year acquisitions offset in part by the full year amortization of additional intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of signaltree solutions in march and one other acquisition complementary to our business strategy made during the third quarter of restructuring charges  net during  we reevaluated our estimates recorded for the restructuring charge taken in and as a result recorded an expense reduction of million for workforce reductions  and million related to the costs of consolidating and or closing certain non profitable offices 
in addition  during we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
of this charge  million was for an additional workforce reduction of employees and million was for the costs associated with a branch office closing 
the net impact of these actions resulted in a net expense reduction to the restructuring charge of  in our consolidated statement of income 
during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
this charge consisted of million related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees  million for branch office closings and certain other expenditures  million of assets which became impaired as a result of these restructuring actions  and million for a net change in the prior year s estimate for workforce reductions  branch office closures  and other expenditures 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income for was million compared to million in the increase in interest and dividend income was the result of higher average cash balances and marketable securities offset in part by overall lower interest rates compared to the same period in the higher average cash balances and marketable securities was due to the investment of the net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible subordinated debentures debentures issue in june and our strong cash flow 
our cash balances were reduced by cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock in interest expense interest expense for was million compared to  in the interest expense increase is primarily related to the issuance of our debentures and our new corporate facility 
the accounting for the facility as explained in note related parties  commitments  and contingencies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  requires us to impute interest expense on the accrued building costs 
other income  net other income was million for compared to million in other income in included a million payment received for a favorable judgment in an arbitration award proceeding related to damages for breach of an agreement between signal corporation and our federal systems subsidiary 
minority interest during the fourth quarter of  we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest in worldzen  a privately held bpo firm 
our initial investment resulted in an equity position of approximately of the issued and outstanding capital stock of worldzen with the right to increase our ownership position over time 
as a result of this transaction  we began to consolidate worldzen s financial results with ours in the fourth quarter of the amount in minority interest represents the loss attributable to minority shareholders for the period that we consolidated worldzen 
income taxes we generated income before taxes of million for compared to million in the provision for income taxes represents the amounts owed for federal  state  and foreign taxes 
the effective income tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before the provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for and  and reflects an adjustment of prior year s estimated tax liability in and a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective rate for each period is included in note income taxes in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net income net income increased to million in compared to million in the improvement in net income is the result of the absence of a restructuring charge in  improved operating income margins  and the favorable judgment in an arbitration award in compared to revenues dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease plan    build    manage    total    revenues revenues increased in compared to as the result of new clients and new client billings due to the acquisition of metro  which was completed on november   and the acquisition of signaltree solutions  which was completed on march  plan 
the decrease in plan service revenues in compared to was primarily the result of the deferral of consulting projects and a decrease in billing rates caused by general economic conditions 
build 
build service revenues were adversely affected during by the deferral of software development projects in both north america and the uk  as well as by reduced billing rates due to the current reduction in capital spending related to technology 
however  the decline in our build services revenue was offset in part by revenue generated from the less cyclical public sector and healthcare related vertical markets  which contributed growing and more stable revenue streams within the build services sector 
manage 
the improvement in manage services revenue was the result of increasing revenue from our application outsourcing service  and the acquisitions of metro and signaltree solutions 
although not immune to economic fluctuations  application outsourcing revenues are more stable than those associated with plan or build service revenues due to the long term and recurring nature of outsourcing contracts and the cost saving benefits related to outsourcing 
generally  under an application outsourcing agreement  we receive a fixed monthly fee in return for meeting or exceeding a contractually agreed upon service level 
application outsourcing agreements generally do not require any capital outlay from us  and we recognize outsourcing revenue and expense on a monthly basis consistent with the service provided to our customers 
the following table summarizes certain line items from our consolidated statements of income dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease revenues    salaries  wages  and other direct costs gross margin    gross margin salaries  wages  and other direct costs the increase in salaries  wages  and other direct costs was primarily attributable to the metro and signaltree solutions acquisitions 
salaries  wages  and other direct costs were million  or  of total revenues  for and million  or  of total revenues in total billable employees for all operations were  in  compared to  in the lower billable employees resulted from a need to bring personnel resources  which account for the vast majority of our direct costs  in alignment with anticipated revenue 
our billable employees within our india operation were billable employees as of december  we did not have billable employees in india during gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue for was  compared to in the decrease in gross margins reflects continuing softness in the demand for it services resulting in lower billing rates and utilization of billable personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses for increased million  or  compared to sg a expenses for were million  or  of total revenue  compared to million  or  of total revenue for the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenue was the result of cost synergies obtained from the acquisition of metro as well as our continuing focus on tightly controlling discretionary expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses was attributable to personnel costs incurred in connection with the metro and signaltree solutions acquisitions 
during the first quarter of  we completed the integration of metro s corporate functions with our own  and during the second quarter of  we completed the consolidation and relocation of overlapping branch offices 
during the second quarter of  we also integrated us based operations acquired from signaltree solutions with our own 
during the third quarter of  we integrated all corporate functions of signaltree solutions into our corporate headquarters in boston  massachusetts 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for was million  or  of total revenue compared to million  or of total revenue  for the increase in amortization of intangible assets was primarily attributable to additional intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions of metro and signaltree solutions offset by the impact of the adoption of sfas no

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity  as defined  by its primary beneficiary 
primary beneficiaries are those companies that are subject to a majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  an entity with a variable interest shall treat variable interests in that same entity held by its related parties as its own interests 
fin is effective prospectively for all variable interests obtained subsequent to december  for variable interests existing prior to december   consolidation will be required beginning july  in december  the fasb agreed to a broad based deferral of the effective date of fin for public companies until the end of periods ending after march   with the exception of interests in special purpose entities  which are required in financial statements of public companies for periods ending after december  we have evaluated the applicability of fin to our relationship with each of city square limited partnership city square and gateway llc and determined that these entities are not required to be consolidated within our consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that gateway llc is not a variable interest entity as the equity investment is sufficient to absorb the expected losses and the holders of the equity investment do not lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest 
we have concluded that as we no longer occupy the space at ten city square and no longer derive any benefit from leasing the space  we would not be determined to be the related party most closely associated with city square 
as a result  we will continue to account for our leases with city square and gateway llc consistent with our historical practices in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that we do not have an interest in any variable interest entities that would require consolidation

liquidity and capital resources consolidated financial condition dollars in thousands years ended december  cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of exchange rate on cash  increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   we have historically financed our operations through our ability to generate cash from operations 
we use the net cash generated from our operations to fund capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  and stock repurchases 
if we were to experience a decrease in revenue as a result of a decrease in demand for our services or a decrease in our ability to collect receivables  we would be required to reduce discretionary spending related to sg a expenses and adjust our workforce in an effort to maintain profitability 
through the net cash provided by operations during  combined with the proceeds of our convertible debt offering completed in june  we have increased our cash and cash equivalents  and our marketable securities position to million at december  we intend to use our cash and marketable securities for general corporate purposes  which may include additional repurchases of our common stock under existing or future share repurchase programs and the funding of future acquisitions and other corporate transactions 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in increased million compared to due to higher net income and improvements in working capital 
we drove the improvements in working capital through our continuing efforts to increase collections of accounts receivable 
the improvement in collections is evident by a reduction in dso  which was days  days  and days at december    and  respectively 
we calculate dso using the trailing three months total revenue divided by the number of days in the quarter to equal daily revenue 
the average accounts receivable balance for the three month period is then divided by daily revenue 
cash provided by operating activities also improved due to a million award that we received in the first quarter of this award was the result of an arbitration proceeding that we initiated in for a breach of an agreement between signal corporation and our federal systems subsidiary 
partially offsetting this increase is approximately million that we paid associated with prior and current restructuring charges and million that we paid in connection with settling a legal claim in the third quarter on net cash provided by operating activities in decreased million compared to due primarily to the lower operating results 
during  we paid million associated with prior and current restructuring charges 
partially offsetting the operating results and restructuring payments were the improvements in working capital  particularly in the collections of our accounts receivables 
we believe that cash generated from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements through the next months and beyond 
however  in order to protect against the current economic conditions persisting in and beyond  we have taken and will continue to take  as we deem necessary  steps to reduce our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenue 
we anticipate that current cash on hand  cash generated from operations and cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan will be adequate to fund our planned capital and financing expenditures for the next months and beyond 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in each of   and was primarily for investments  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
during  we purchased million and sold million in marketable securities  generating a net use of cash of million 
in addition  we invested million on property and equipment  and capitalized software costs in connection with the implementation of our peoplesoft enterprise resource planning applications 
we also invested million  net of cash acquired  for the controlling interest in worldzen and paid million related to prior year s acquisitions 
during  we purchased million and sold million in marketable securities  generating net cash of million  which we used to partially fund acquisitions 
in  we paid million  net of cash acquired  to acquire signaltree solutions  and another smaller business that is complementary to our business strategy 
in connection with the smaller complementary business acquisition  we may have to pay additional earn out consideration that is based on achieving specific net revenue targets 
payments in the next months for achieving these goals may range from million to million 
during we also recorded million as deferred revenue related to contingent service credits and issued a million non interest bearing note payable as partial consideration 
as of december   the deferred revenue and non interest bearing note each had a balance of million  a reduction of million resulting from the delivery of related service credits 
the note has a one year term with a one year extension expiring on september  during  we also invested million on property and equipment  and capitalized software costs in connection with the implementation of our peoplesoft enterprise resource planning applications 
during  we purchased million and sold million in marketable securities 
in addition  we invested million on property and equipment 
we also completed the merger of metro by exchanging our common stock for all of the common stock of metro 
in connection with this merger  we paid million in transaction costs 
partially offsetting these cash requirements was million in proceeds that we received in connection with the sale of our help desk business 
on february   we acquired nims associates  inc nims  an information technology and consulting services company with offices in the midwest and adcs in indianapolis and dallas 
in exchange for all of nims outstanding stock  we paid million in cash to shareholders of nims  with the potential to pay up to an additional million in earn out consideration over the next three years  contingent upon the achievement of certain future financial targets 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities in june  we received million in proceeds from our issuance of convertible subordinated debentures 
from these proceeds  we simultaneously invested approximately million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock from authorizations approved by our board of directors in october of and may of net proceeds after the repurchase of shares and approximately million debt issuance costs were approximately million 
see note convertible subordinated debentures in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debentures 
additionally during  we were authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated transactions  with the timing and amount of shares purchased determined by our management based on its evaluation of market and economic conditions and other factors 
from january  through december   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
the following is a summary of our repurchase activity for   and dollars in thousands shares amount shares amount shares amount prior year authorizations at beginning of year   authorizations    repurchases      shares remaining as of december    between may and december   we have invested approximately million to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock under nine separate authorizations 
these share repurchases more than offset the shares issued under our various stock ownership programs 
under these stock ownership programs  we issued  shares   shares  and  shares and received proceeds of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in february  we entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with two banks 
the credit facility replaces a previous million demand line of credit  which expired in july the terms of the credit facility require us to maintain a maximum total funded debt and other financial ratios 
the credit facility also includes covenants that  subject to certain specific exceptions and limitations  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional debt  make certain acquisitions or dispositions of assets  create liens  and pay dividends 
on june   we and two of our banks amended certain provisions of the credit facility relating to financial covenants 
these covenants  which include total indebtedness and leverage ratios  are no more restrictive than those initially contained in the credit facility 
on october  and february   we and two of our banks further amended certain provisions of the credit facility to expand our ability to make certain acquisitions 
the annual commitment fee for maintaining the credit facility is basis points on the unused portion of the credit facility  up to a maximum of  as of december   we had no debt outstanding under the credit facility 
we may draw upon the credit facility up to million less any outstanding letters of credit that have been issued against the credit facility 
any amounts drawn upon the credit facility constitute senior indebtedness for purposes of the debentures 
borrowings bear interest at one of the bank s base rate or the euro currency reserve rate 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  marketable securities  cash flows from operations  and our new line of credit will be sufficient to meet our current capital requirements for at least the next months 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily the result of our share repurchase program 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total investment of approximately million at an average per share price of  which was partially offset by million in cash proceeds from our various stock ownership programs 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to the payment of debt acquired in connection with the merger of metro and the repayment of long term debt 
increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  million  and million at december    and  respectively

off balance sheet arrangements in january  the fasb issued fin  which requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity  as defined  by its primary beneficiary 
primary beneficiaries are those companies that are subject to a majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
in determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  an entity with a variable interest shall treat variable interests in that same entity held by its related parties as its own interests 
fin is effective prospectively for all variable interests obtained subsequent to december  for variable interests existing prior to december   consolidation will be required beginning july  in december  the fasb agreed to a broad based deferral of the effective date of fin for public companies until the end of periods ending after march   with the exception of interests in special purpose entities  which are required in financial statements of public companies for periods ending after december  we have evaluated the applicability of fin to our relationship with each of city square and gateway llc and determined that these entities are not required to be consolidated within our consolidated financial statements 
we have determined that gateway llc is not a variable interest entity as the equity investment is sufficient to absorb the expected losses and the holders of the equity investment do not lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest 
we have concluded that as we no longer occupy the space at ten city square and no longer derive any benefit from leasing the space  we would not be determined to be the related party most closely associated with city square 
as a result  we will continue to account for our leases with city square and gateway llc consistent with our historical practices in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that we do not have an interest in any variable interest entities that would require consolidation 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the statement requires a guarantor to record certain guarantees at fair value and to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the interpretation and its disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  under fin  the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees issued prior to december  will not be revised or restated 
we are a guarantor with respect to a line of credit for innovate ec  an entity in which we acquired a minor equity position as a result of a previous acquisition 
the total line of credit is for  we guarantee  of this obligation 
the line is subject to review by the lending institution 
we would be required to meet our guarantor obligation in the event the lending institution refuses to extend the credit facility and innovate ec is unable to satisfy its obligation 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflationary increases in costs have not been material in recent years and  to the extent permitted by competitive pressures  are passed on to clients through increased billing rates 
rates charged by us are based on the cost of labor and market conditions within the industry 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
our quarterly operating results have varied  and may continue to vary significantly 
this may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results 
our gross margins vary based on a variety of factors including employee utilization rates and the number and type of services performed during a particular period 
a variety of factors influence our revenue in a particular quarter  including general economic conditions  which may influence investment decisions or cause downsizing  the number and requirements of client engagements  employee utilization rates  changes in the rates we can charge clients for services  acquisitions  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
a significant portion of our expenses do not vary relative to revenue 
as a result  if revenue in a particular quarter does not meet expectations  our operating results could be materially adversely affected  which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  many of our engagements are terminable without client penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in an increase in underutilized employees and a decrease in revenue and profits 
we have pursued  and intend to continue to pursue  strategic acquisitions 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets may adversely affect our financial performance 
in recent years  we have grown significantly through acquisitions 
from january  through march   we have completed acquisitions 
the aggregate merger and consideration costs of these acquisitions totaled approximately million 
our future growth may be based in part on selected acquisitions 
at any given time  we may be in various stages of considering acquisition opportunities 
we may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into a definitive agreement with any one target 
in addition  even if we reach a definitive agreement with a target  we may be unable to complete any future acquisition 
we anticipate that each acquisition will bring benefits  such as an increase in revenue 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if these benefits will be realized 
accordingly  there is a risk that an acquired company may not achieve an increase in revenue or other benefits for us 
in addition  an acquisition may result in unexpected costs  expenses  and liabilities 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the process of integrating acquired companies into our existing business might also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which we may otherwise devote to our existing business 
in addition  the process may require significant financial resources that we might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
finally  future acquisitions could result in our having to incur additional debt and or contingent liabilities 
we may also issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions  which could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
any of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and result of operations 
we face significant competition for our services  and our failure to remain competitive could limit our ability to maintain existing clients or attract new clients 
the market for our services is highly competitive 
the technology for custom software services can change rapidly 
the market is fragmented  and no company holds a dominant position 
consequently  our competition for client assignments and experienced personnel varies significantly from city to city and by the type of service provided 
some of our competitors are larger and have greater technical  financial  and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the markets they serve than we do 
in addition  clients may elect to increase their internal information systems resources to satisfy their custom software development and integration needs 
in the healthcare software systems market  we compete with some companies that are larger in the healthcare market and have greater financial resources than we do 
we believe that significant competitive factors in the healthcare software systems market include size and demonstrated ability to provide service to targeted healthcare markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we conduct business in the uk  canada  and india  which exposes us to a number of difficulties inherent in international activities 
as a result of our acquisition of signaltree solutions in march  we now have three software development facilities in india 
as of december   we had approximately technical professionals in the region 
india is currently experiencing conflicts with pakistan over the disputed territory of kashmir as well as clashes between different religious groups within the country 
these conflicts  in addition to other unpredictable developments in the political  economic  and social conditions in india  could eliminate or reduce the availability of these development and professional services 
if access to these services were to be unexpectedly eliminated or significantly reduced  our ability to meet development objectives important to our strategy to add offshore delivery capabilities to the services we provide would be hindered  and our business could be harmed 
if we fail to manage our geographically dispersed organization  we may fail to meet or exceed our financial objectives and our revenues may decline 
we perform development activities in the us  canada  and in india  and have offices throughout the us  uk  canada  and india 
this geographic dispersion requires us to devote substantial management resources that locally based competitors do not need to devote to their operations 
our operations in the uk  canada  and india are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  changes in taxation  and other difficulties in managing operations overseas 
we may not be successful in managing our international operations 
we may be unable to re deploy our professionals effectively if engagements are terminated unexpectedly  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with us on short notice 
if they do so  we may be unable to reassign our professionals to new engagements without delay 
the cancellation or reduction in scope of an engagement could  therefore  reduce the utilization rate of our professionals  which would have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  our past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and we expect that our results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future 
our growth could be limited if we are unable to attract and retain personnel in the information technology and business consulting industries 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to develop our business 
if we do not  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may be prohibited from repurchasing  and may not have the financial resources to repurchase  our debentures on the date for repurchase at the option of the holder or upon a designated event  as required by the indenture governing our debentures due on june   which could cause defaults under our senior revolving credit facility and any other indebtedness we may incur in the future 
the debenture holders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures on june  the debenture holders may also require us to repurchase all or a portion of their debentures upon a designated event  as defined in the indenture governing the debentures 
if the debenture holders elect to require us to repurchase their debentures on any of the above dates or if a designated event were to occur  we may not have enough funds to pay the repurchase price for all tendered debentures 
we are currently prohibited under our senior revolving credit facility from repurchasing any debentures if a designated event were to occur 
we may also be prohibited under any indebtedness we may incur in the future from purchasing any debentures prior to their stated maturity 
in these circumstances  we will be required to repay all of the outstanding principal of  and pay any accrued and unpaid interest on  such indebtedness or to obtain the requisite consents from the holders of any such indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the debentures 
if we are unable to repay all of such indebtedness or are unable to obtain the necessary consents  we will be unable to offer to repurchase the debentures  which would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the debentures  which itself could constitute a default under our senior revolving credit facility or under the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 
in addition  the events that constitute a designated event under the indenture for the debentures are events of default under our senior revolving credit facility and may also be events of default under other indebtedness that we may incur in the future 
we incurred indebtedness when we sold our debentures 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the indebtedness created by the sale of our debentures  and any future indebtedness  could adversely affect our business and our ability to make full payment on the debentures 
our aggregate level of indebtedness increased in connection with the sale of our debentures 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness and had the ability to incur additional debt under our revolving credit facility 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
any increase in our leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  limiting our ability to make acquisitions  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 
our ability to satisfy our future obligations  including debt service on our debentures  depends on our future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive  and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt  or sell assets 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk instruments or purchasing hedging or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  and commodity price or equity price risk 
we have not purchased options or entered into swaps or forward or futures contracts 
our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk on our investments  which would affect the carrying value of those investments 
however  changes in market rates and the related impact on the fair value of our investments would not generally affect net income as our investments are fixed rate securities and are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
since january   the united states federal reserve board has significantly decreased certain benchmark interest rates  which has led to a general decline in market interest rates 
the decline in market interest rates has had an impact on the rate of return on our cash and investments 
additionally  we transact business in the uk  canada  and india and as such have exposure associated with movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
in  net revenues derived from our foreign operations totaled approximately of our total revenues
