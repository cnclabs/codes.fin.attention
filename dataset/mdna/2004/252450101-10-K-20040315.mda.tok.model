automated laboratory systems a systems provider  dpc designs and manufactures laboratory instruments and software to automate the performance of immunodiagnostic assays  facilitating rapid  accurate results  while reducing labor and reagent costs 
the company has two principal immunoassay platforms 
dpc s immulite addresses the needs of high volume laboratories  while the immulite serves lower volume facilities and niche markets 
at the end of  over  immulite and over  immulite systems had been shipped 
the original immulite system was first introduced in computer driven  it uses a patented solid phase wash technology and chemiluminescent detection method  which together are capable of measurements at exceptionally low concentrations  as demonstrated by dpc s state of the art third generation assays for tsh and psa key tests related to thyroid disorders and prostate cancer  respectively 
the system is totally automated with respect to sample and reagent handling  incubation  washing  and substrate addition 
dpc s immulite has the capacity for walk away processing of up to samples per hour  on a random access basis meaning that it can perform any test  or combination of tests  on any patient sample at any time 
in  the company ceased manufacturing the immulite and began manufacturing the immulite this system has essentially the same operational features and runs the same tests as the immulite  but it utilizes updated operating software and is capable of performing certain dilutions on board 
in addition  it has a new exterior appearance 
the company refers to the immulite as the immulite 
the immulite  dpc s next generation system  was introduced in the third quarter of it has a throughput of up to tests per hour  offering the medium to high volume laboratory increased efficiency in streamlining its testing workload 
the immulite can run for a full shift without having to replenish on board supplies 
this increased throughput allows dpc to participate in a higher volume segment of the market where the average reagent use per instrument exceeds that of the original immulite 
the immulite includes advanced features such as primary tube sampling and a proprietary autodilution capability 
the system can be connected to the customer s computer system for specification of the tests to be run on each sample  as well as for reporting and archiving results 
the system can also be interfaced with robotic laboratory sample handling systems such as the company s sample management system sms  which was introduced in the sms provides a bulk sample loading platform for up to samples  which improves a laboratory s workflow flexibility and productivity 
innovative service features include a remote diagnostic capability that permits dpc s service facility to access any immulite worldwide for the purpose of diagnosing system problems and real time service that enables the immulite to monitor itself and to proactively contact the company s service facility if it senses a potential problem 
in this way  the company may be able to solve a problem before a customer is aware that it exists 
for the last three years  the growth of dpc s business and its role as an ivd systems provider for high volume facilities has been driven primarily by ongoing demand for the immulite in  the company obtained distribution rights from medical electronic systems of israel to a sperm analyzer that dpc markets under the name spermalite 
the spermalite is a stand alone  benchtop high performance analyzer that provides rapid reliable semen analysis in less than seconds 
in early  dpc expects to launch a major new instrument  the immulite this instrument will be similar to the immulite but will reduce the time it takes to get a result from certain tests  most importantly tests used in emergency rooms to aid in the diagnosis of cardiac conditions 
the company also expects to launch an enhanced version of the sms workcell that will connect to two immulite s or s 
the sms will eventually function as a universal robotic interface that can be linked to almost any of the workcell automated systems available 
immunodiagnostic test kits dpc manufactures over immunodiagnostic test kits  exploiting several technologies and assay formats 
the company s monoclonal antibody  molecular engineering  and other basic science capabilities play key roles in optimizing these immunoassays 
chemiluminescence enhanced enzyme immunoassays are the basis for dpc s automated immulite and immulite product lines 
dpc also manufactures classic radioimmunoassays rias  based on double antibody  coated tube  and irma formats  as well as enzyme immunoassays eias in microplate format 
allergy testing uses a proprietary liquid allergen technology that is now fully automated on the immulite the company s microplate allergy format was discontinued at the end of many of dpc s assays are available both as manual rias and as immulite and immulite assays 
the automated  non isotopic product lines represent the core of dpc s business 
immulite and immulite assays  instruments  and service represented   and of sales in   and  respectively  a trend that is expected to continue 
in fiscal year  dpc s rias accounted for of sales  while microplate allergy and other non immulite products accounted for 
for additional information concerning sales by product line over the last three fiscal years  see notes to consolidated financial statements note effective july   the company sold its pathodx line of manual tests to remel  inc for million 
the company will continue to manufacture the product for remel for up to two years 
during this period the company will assist remel in developing the expertise to take over the manufacturing process 
breadth of menu immulite and immulite are closed systems  they will not perform other manufacturers tests 
accordingly  an important factor in the successful marketing of these systems is the ability to offer a broad menu of individual assays and assay groups  that is  tests which jointly represent decision making panels for various disease states  such as thyroid disorders or infertility 
many of the relevant disease states addressed by these tests represent either high volume opportunities in the marketplace  or unique  under served conditions that allow dpc to fill a market niche 
during  dpc released new assays on the immulite and new assays on the immulite as of december   dpc had immulite assays available and immulite assays available 
dpc believes that the immulite and immulite have the most extensive menus of any automated immunoassay systems on the market 
the company s research and development activities continue to focus on expanding the menus  giving special attention to complete implementations of clinically important assay groups  as well as on developing new generations of instrumentation and software 
in february of the company was informed by the united states food and drug administration fda that it was subject to the fda s application integrity policy 
as a result  the fda will defer reviewing new test applications until the company has successfully resolved the fda s issues  see government regulation 
the spectrum of applications major clinical applications of dpc s immunoassays include the following areas  where dpc s extensive and sometimes unique offerings on the immulite and immulite have enabled the company to achieve a significant presence in various types of laboratories  large and small 
thyroid disorders for many hospital and clinical reference laboratories  thyroid testing is a mainstay of their routine immunoassay work 
dpc offers a comprehensive spectrum of assays for assessing and monitoring thyroid status on both the immulite and the immulite the menus include not only assays for free and total thyroid hormones  but also assays with third generation capability for thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and assays for thyroid autoantibodies and other relevant analytes which are increasingly in demand 
this combination represents a complete  high quality solution for thyroid testing 
therapeutic drug monitoring tdm there is a large market for tdm assays tests for the routine monitoring of certain therapeutic drugs 
nine of the ten most frequently monitored drugs are measured by immunoassay 
infertility  pregnancy dpc has been an innovator and longtime market leader in reproductive hormone testing  providing an unusually broad spectrum of assays for both routine and specialized laboratories  supplemented by studies to aid in the interpretation of results and software to facilitate data manipulation  when appropriate 
some of dpc s assays reflect the special needs of fertility clinics and in vitro fertilization ivf centers 
others are important for the routine assessment of osteoporosis and hormone balance in postmenopausal women and aging men 
dpc offers a comprehensive menu of immunoassays for maternal and fetal diagnosis  monitoring  and risk assessment 
cancer dpc has automated a large number of assays for tumor markers on the immulite and immulite  more than any of its competitors 
the company has a number of unique offerings  including third generation assays capable of measuring the extremely low psa concentrations encountered after radical prostatectomy 
in partnership with matritech  in dpc released the first automated assay for nmp  a marker for bladder cancer 
infectious diseases infectious disease testing is one of the fastest growing segments of the ivd market and one which has generally lagged behind in automation 
dpc s commitment in this area is reflected in its development of one of the broadest menus available on an automated platform  it includes some unique assays  eg for h 
pylori  an organism responsible for stomach ulcers 
in  dpc received fda approval for a total of hepatitis b assays providing the most complete panel of automated assays available 
allergy in vitro allergy testing  representing a worldwide market of approximately million  has been dominated for the last years by pharmacia corp 
traditionally  such testing has required special laboratory equipment and has been time and labor intensive  and somewhat error prone due to the lack of full automation 
with its patented liquid allergen technology  dpc established itself as the second leading supplier of in vitro allergy test kits 
in  the company introduced assays for selected allergy screening panels on the immulite 
then  in september  dpc introduced a broad spectrum of assays for individual allergens on the immulite  finally making it possible for laboratories to perform high volume allergy testing along with other routine immunoassays on a fully automated system 
the immulite can provide tests for over allergens  representing over of allergy requests 
as a complement to immulite allergy  dpc has developed a product line alablot of confirmatory western blotting assays 
inflammatory conditions cytokines  often referred to as hormones of the immune system  represent potentially important disease markers  which are being actively investigated in major centers throughout the world 
in europe and elsewhere  assays for clinically relevant cytokines are already in routine use  eg for the management of bacterial sepsis blood poisoning in intensive care units 
dpc is the only company to offer a significant menu of cytokine assays in an automated format 
moreover  dpc offers some novel tests  having obtained  for example  exclusive rights from xoma ltd 
to market an automated immunoassay for lbp lipopolysaccharide binding protein  a marker of inflammation reflecting systemic exposure to gram negative bacteria 
cardiovascular disease this is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed nations and represents a million worldwide market  which continues to show very strong annual growth 
both on the immulite and the immulite  dpc now offers the most comprehensive cardiac menu available on a single platform 
the three principal assays required on an emergency basis due to their role in diagnosing acute myocardial infarction troponin i  ck mb  and myoglobin have been implemented on the immulite with turbo software  which reduces the assay time to minutes  along with other tests needed in an emergency room or intra operative setting hcg  pth 
additional assays on dpc s automated systems  including high sensitivity crp and homocysteine  put the company in an excellent position to address all aspects of cardiac testing  from diagnosis and patient management to risk assessment 
the company is in the process of developing tests for pro bnp and d dimer 
research and development activities the company devotes substantial resources to research and development to update and improve its existing products  as well as to develop new products and technologies 
r d capabilities in the united states include fully staffed departments in organic synthesis  biochemistry  antisera hybridoma  protein chemistry  molecular biology  infectious disease  method development  instrumentation  software  and technology development 
during the years ended december    and  the company spent   and  respectively  on research and development 
the company is engaged in an aggressive development program for new instrument systems  including the continued development of the sample management system  a robotic sample handling device that enhances the functionality of the immulite  the immulite  which incorporates the turbo function into the immulite  the immulite  a very high throughput immunoassay system incorporating several new technologies to deliver optimal assay performance  and the immulite  a scaled down version of the immulite in addition  the company continues to work in the area of molecular diagnostics 
manufacturing and service dpc is a fully integrated company  its operations range from in house antibody development to system component assembly to assay labeling and packaging 
this vertical integration enables dpc to maintain manufacturing and quality control and to react quickly to market needs 
the company s principal test kit manufacturing facility is located in los angeles  california 
approximately of test kit production is conducted at the euro dpc facility in the united kingdom 
the company s european manufacturing facilities enable the company to improve its competitiveness in the european economic area eea by minimizing import duties and freight charges 
certain kits are also manufactured by dpc in china 
dpc s instrument division in new jersey designs and manufactures immulite instrumentation and engages in software development 
component parts  such as computer hardware  are supplied by original equipment manufacturers 
the company generally provides a one year warranty that covers parts and labor 
underwriter s laboratories inc ul lists the immulite systems 
the company s and its distributors technical service personnel install new units  train customers in the use of the system  and provide maintenance and service for the instrumentation 
the euro dpc instrumentation division in the united kingdom manufactures certain components of the immulite and immulite instruments that are then assembled into the final instrument in new jersey 
dpc s los angeles and new jersey facilities are international standards organization iso and registered 
euro dpc limited  the company s wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary in wales  was the first immunodiagnostics company in the world to be registered under british standard bs and is also registered to iso and iso standards 
the china facility is registered to iso dpc provides technical support for all its products  including reagents  instruments  and software  via telephone and on site service 
in dpc introduced real time service on the immulite system 
real time service connects an installed immulite instrument to dpc s technical support department through a secure network connection to provide constant hour monitoring and support 
should a particular system function begin to fail or degrade  an alert is sent to a technical support representative 
marketing and sales the company markets its products to hospital  clinical  forensic  research  reference  and veterinary laboratories  as well as doctors offices and us government agencies 
the company markets its products in the united states directly to laboratories and hospitals through its own sales force 
the company sells to the us doctors office market through independent distributors as well as through its own sales force 
sales personnel and distributors are trained to demonstrate the company s product line in the customer s laboratory and are supported by the company s los angeles and new jersey based technical services departments 
the company s products are sold on a worldwide basis through distributors in over foreign countries 
these distributors  including affiliated distributors  also sell other manufacturer s products that are not directly competitive with the company s products 
foreign sales including export sales  sales to non consolidated foreign affiliates  and sales of consolidated subsidiaries represented approximately of total sales in and and in europe accounted for approximately of total sales in  in  and in see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding foreign operations 
sales of test kits to customers and distributors are made against individual purchase orders as well as through volume purchase arrangements 
products are shipped directly from the company s facilities in los angeles and wales and are generally delivered domestically within hours and overseas within hours of receipt of order 
the company sells  leases  rents or places the immulite instrumentation to hospitals and reference laboratories that perform volume testing 
the company s backlog at any date is usually insignificant and not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
the company s foreign operations are subject to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political and economic instability  and trade restrictions 
because the company s consolidated foreign distributors sales are in the respective local currencies  the company s consolidated financial results are affected by foreign currency translation adjustments 
in addition  the price competitiveness of the company s products abroad is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
proprietary and other rights substantially all of the company s products are based on the company s or licensed third party proprietary technologies and know how 
the company holds various us and foreign patents  including patents on the washing process used in the immulite system that expire in and patents on its novel liquid based amplification methodology which forms the basis of the immulite allergy product lines which expire in the company also obtains licenses for chemical components and technologies used in certain of its assays 
patents that may be granted to others in the future could inhibit the company s expansion or entry into certain areas  or require it to pay royalty fees to do so 
because of rapid technological developments in the immunodiagnostic industry with concurrent extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  certain of the company s products may involve controversy concerning infringement of existing patents or patents that may be issued in the future 
the company purchases certain chemical compounds that are key components in the immulite system from lumigen  inc  the sole supplier of these chemical compounds 
the company owns a interest in lumigen  inc and accounts for this interest using the equity method 
the company has the right to use the chemical compounds for the duration of the underlying patents in return for a royalty payment to the owners of the patents 
the company s business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if lumigen  inc was unable to meet the company s supply requirements 
in such an event  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain alternative components that have the same performance characteristics or what the costs of such alternatives would be 
government regulation the company s business is affected by government regulations both in the united states and abroad  in particular western europe and japan  aimed at containing the cost of medical services 
these regulations have generally had the effect of inhibiting the growth rate of the immunodiagnostic industry 
the company believes that in vitro diagnostic ivd testing is an important tool for reducing health expenditures 
by providing early diagnosis and therapy management  ivd tests can reduce the high costs of hospitalization  surgery  and recovery 
in response to cost containment measures  hospitals and laboratories have consolidated and have sought to increase productivity by replacing high cost labor with automated testing systems 
the company s automated systems address these market needs 
the company also seeks to develop more rapid and sensitive tests  such as dpc s third generation tsh assay  that can eliminate the need for redundant testing 
manufacturers of immunodiagnostic tests and other clinical products intended for use as human diagnostics are governed by the united states food and drug administration fda regulations as well as regulations of state agencies and foreign countries 
a new in vitro diagnostic product that is substantially equivalent to one already on the market can generally be sold in the united states after it is cleared for marketing by the fda 
most of the company s products fall within the substantially equivalent category 
certain medically critical in vitro diagnostic products and totally new in vitro diagnostic products  for which there are no equivalents on the market  must be approved by the fda after in depth review that normally takes about two years prior to marketing 
in february  the company was informed by the fda that  based on inspectional findings that included data integrity and procedural issues  the company was subject to the fda s application integrity policy 
the fda suspended its review of all applications submitted by the company and will defer the review of any future applications until the fda determines that the company has resolved these issues 
the resolution process consists of developing and implementing a corrective action plan that will be audited by a third party and reviewed by the fda 
the company believes that months is a reasonable time for such actions to take place 
during this time  the company is not restricted by the fda with regard to introducing new tests outside of the united states 
however  the company s inability to introduce new tests in the united states during this period may have a negative impact on the future sales and profits 
the company s los angeles manufacturing facilities are licensed by the california department of health services and must be operated in conformance with the fda s good manufacturing practices governing medical devices 
the company is regulated by the california department of health services with respect to its possession and use of radioactive substances and by the us drug enforcement agency with respect to the use and storage of controlled drugs and pharmaceuticals 
given the company s high proportion of sales to the european union eu countries  the company was fully compliant with all relevant aspects of the eu in vitro diagnostic directive ivdd on june  and therefore was qualified to apply the ce mark to most of its ivd kits and instruments as mandated by the directive 
many other countries outside of the eu have accepted the ce mark to fulfill their local requirements or are developing equivalent regulations 
dpc is prepared to comply with these and future ivd regulations 
competition the company s major competitors are broad based health care companies such as roche diagnostics  abbott diagnostics abbott laboratories  bayer  johnson johnson  beckman coulter  and pharmacia upjohn sweden 
the company competes on a worldwide basis with a number of large corporations that sell diversified lines of products  including immunodiagnostic products  for laboratory  medical  and hospital use 
the fact that these companies offer diversified products to the laboratories at times puts the company at a competitive disadvantage 
there are currently over domestic suppliers of immunodiagnostic kits 
the company believes that competition in immunoassay testing is based on quality  service  product convenience  and price and that product innovation is an important source for change in market share 
the principal competitive factors in automated systems are size of menu the number of assays that can be performed on the system  ease of use  time to results  and overall cost effectiveness equipment cost  service  and reagent cost 
the company s immulite system currently offers one of the widest menus of any automated system and the company is focusing its development efforts on expanding this menu and improving the response time and efficiency of its instruments 
employees as of december   the company including its consolidated subsidiaries had  employees  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in marketing and sales  and in administration 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union  and the company considers its employee relations to be good 
the company has experienced no significant problems in recruiting qualified technical and operational personnel

overview dpc develops and manufactures automated diagnostic test systems and related reagent test kits that are used by hospital  reference  and physicians office laboratories throughout the world 
the company s principal product line  immulite  is a fully automated  computer driven modular system that uses specialized proprietary software to provide rapid  accurate test results that reduce the customer s labor and reagent costs 
our immunoassay tests provide critical information useful to physicians in the diagnosis  monitoring  management  and prevention of various diseases 
dpc manufactures over immunodiagnostic test kits also called reagents or assays using several different technologies and assay formats 
the immulite instruments are closed systems  meaning that they will not perform other manufacturers tests 
accordingly  a major factor in the successful marketing of these systems is the ability to offer a broad menu of assays 
in addition to the immulite assays  the company sells a broad range of tests based on other technologies that can be performed manually using the customer s own laboratory equipment  such as radioimmunoassay ria and enzyme immunoassay eia tests 
in addition to breadth of menu  major competitive factors for the immulite instruments include time to results how quickly the instrument performs the test  ease of use  and overall cost effectiveness 
because of these competitive factors and the rapid technological developments that characterize the industry  the company devotes approximately of its annual revenues to research and development activities  all of which are expensed as incurred 
the company s products are sold throughout the world directly through affiliated and independent distributors 
historically  foreign sales including us export sales  sales to non consolidated subsidiaries and independent distributors  and sales of consolidated subsidiaries have accounted for more than of revenues  although  in recent years  domestic sales growth has outpaced foreign sales growth 
the company derives revenues from two principal sources reagent test kit sales and immulite instrument placements 
the company recognizes sales of test kits upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
immulite instruments are placed with customers under many different types of arrangements that generally fall into the following categories sale  lease  reagent rental  and soft placement 
the company sells instruments directly to end users  to third party leasing companies that lease the instruments to end users  and to independent distributors that then resell the instruments to their customers 
instrument sales  which represent the smallest component of placements  are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title 
the company also sells instruments under sales type leases  which are recorded as revenue upon shipment in an amount equal to the present value of the future minimum lease payments to be received over the lease term 
many instruments are placed other than by outright sale or capital lease 
the company enters into various types of operating lease arrangements with customers that generally provide for terms of three to five years and periodic rental payments 
revenue on these types of leases is recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
when an instrument is placed on a reagent rental basis  the customer agrees to pay a mark up on reagents  but is not charged for the instrument 
the company also places instruments at no charge to the customer soft placement subject to the customer s agreement to purchase a minimum amount of reagents 
in reagent rentals and soft placements  the only revenue recognized is based on reagent shipments 
under operating lease  rental  and soft placements  dpc continues to own the instrument that is placed with the customer 
these instruments are generally amortized on a straight line basis over five years and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the company also enters into service contracts with customers and recognizes service revenue over the related contract life related costs are expensed as incurred 
two important indicators used by management to evaluate financial performance are instrument shipments and reagent utilization 
the number of immulite instruments that the company reports as being shipped in any period is net of returned instruments  such as returns at the end of a lease or rental or trade ins on the purchase of a new model 
the company refurbishes and seeks to place returned instruments at reduced prices 
because of the different methods in which instruments are placed  total instrument sales vary from period to period based on the relative mix of placement methods  and such sales do not necessarily have a direct correlation to the number of instruments shipped during the period 
an important measure of the penetration of immulite reagent sales is the average amount of reagent sales sold per instrument shipped 
it takes a number of weeks or months after an instrument is shipped for it to become fully functional with regard to reagent utilization 
the company calculates average reagent utilization for a fiscal period by dividing immulite reagent sales for the period by the total number of instruments shipped as of the end of the previous fiscal period 
results of operations summary financial data dollars in thousands  except for share data change change sales gross profit of sales operating expenses selling research development general administrative gain on sale of product line equity in income of affiliates total operating expenses of sales operating income of sales interest other income expense net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes income tax rate minority interest net income earnings per share basic diluted sales the company s sales increased in to million compared to sales of million in  which was a increase over sales of million 
sales of all immulite products instruments and reagents were million  a increase over in  sales of all immulite products were million  a increase over sales of immulite products represented of sales  of sales  and of sales 
various categories of immulite product sales in   and are shown in the following chart immulite product line dollars in millions sales change sales change sales immulite reagents instruments and service total immulite including immulite reagents instruments and service total immulite product line sales the company shipped a total of immulite systems in  including immulite systems and immulite one and systems 
the total base of immulite systems shipped grew to  including  immulite systems 
in  the company shipped a total of  immulite systems including immulite systems  and in the company shipped a total of  systems  including immulite systems 
the twelve percent decrease in immulite shipments in compared to was due to a larger base of immulite s in the market and reduced incremental penetration of the company s target markets 
in addition  the placement of immulite systems may have been adversely impacted by the company s announcement in the third quarter of of its intention to begin shipment of the immulite in the first quarter of the immulite has a longer sales process than the immulite due to a higher sales price and the immulite experiences a longer time delay between instrument placement and the ramp up of reagent sales 
the company expects to experience a similar sales cycle and reagent ramp up cycle for the immulite as with the immulite the immulite  which will reduce the time it takes to get a result from certain tests  most importantly tests in emergency rooms to aid in the diagnosis of cardiac conditions  will be sold at a higher price than the immulite  and sales of the may erode sales of the in  the number of immulite systems shipped declined by over due to larger customers preference for the immulite however  the company believes that immulite sales will continue to be strong and that the immulite offers an important alternative to smaller laboratories that do not need the higher throughput  state of the art immulite the decline in the dollar amount of all immulite instrument sales in compared to  reflected the reduced number of instruments shipped  price decreases on the immulite in anticipation of the release of the immulite and more soft placements of instruments on minimum reagent usage commitments that are reflected in reagent sales only 
the decline in immulite instrument sales in compared to was offset by strong increases in immulite reagent sales  especially immulite reagents 
reagent utilization on the immulite increased to  in the fourth quarter of from  in the fourth quarter of reagent utilization on the immulite instrument also increased to  in the fourth quarter of from  in the fourth quarter of increased reagent utilization on the immulite in was in part a result of a larger test menu that included new hepatitis b tests and the strength of the euro relative to the dollar 
although immulite reagent utilization increased in the fourth quarter of  the company expects average utilization on this instrument to decline as high volume immulite installations are replaced with immulite or immulite instruments and new immulite placements go into lower volume environments 
in  reagent utilization on the immulite increased  reaching  in the fourth quarter versus  in reagent utilization on the immulite decreased to  from  in  this was in part due to high use immulites being replaced with immulite s and incremental immulite shipments going to lower volume users

these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  allowance for bad debts  allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventories  useful lives selected for depreciating property  plant  and equipment  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  and estimates used in the recoverability of long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management does not believe that any of its estimates involve assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or that different reasonable estimates  or changes in accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material impact on the financial statements 
to the extent there are material differences between management s estimates and actual results  future results of operations will be affected
