we undertake no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview of our business we operate two business units 
the obesity surgical and medical management services business operated via our wholly owned subsidiary  vow solutions  inc  based in carlsbad  ca  provides services to physicians and hospitals involved in the surgical treatment of morbid obesity 
our services include management of our original product offering  the laparoscopic bariatric surgery preceptorship  a comprehensive introduction to starting a minimally invasive gastric bypass surgical program

on december  we signed an agreement to sell the visualization technology business to viking systems  inc  see pages and for a description of the terms of the transaction  subject to the approval of our stockholders 
at december   we had employees 
we expect staffing to increase from our obesity management services business  while there would be an elimination of employees from the sale of our visualization technology business in our westborough facility 
we expect that there will be a steady increase in employees during within the obesity management services business which would bring us to approximately employees by the end of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the presentation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are most critical in gaining an understanding of our financial statements include policies and judgments relating to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories and deferred taxes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical in gaining full understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the product and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales returns are estimated based on the historical experience and management s expectations and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
within the obesity surgery management services business  the company s revenues are derived from consulting and training services 
consulting and training services revenue is recognized upon delivery of related marketing materials and completion of the related training component  provided all of the criteria of sab are met 
within the visualization technology business  the company s revenues are derived from the sale of technology products to end users  distributors and original equipment manufactures 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided all the criteria of sab are met 
the company receives semiannual payments as a result of fulfilling certain obligations related to its strategic alliance agreement with ethicon endo surgery  inc ees 
these payments are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the related contract term  provided that the company has complied with all contractual obligations 
inventory inventory is accounted for on a first in first out basis and is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly evaluates inventory for excess quantities or obsolescence and reserves for of inventory considered to be excess or obsolete 
this evaluation requires significant judgment and estimates made by management regarding factors such as customer demand  product life cycle and general market conditions 
at december  such inventory reserves approximated  the company believes it is adequately reserved for obsolescence of current inventory 
however  future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
in addition  the expected sale of the visualization technology business to viking systems  inc may require that we reassess the adequacy of our inventory reserves under the terms of the proposed transaction

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been funds raised from public and private placements of our capital stock and  to a lesser degree  cash flows generated from operations

in addition  we have amounts available under a million bank line of credit facility  which expires in october and is subject to annual renewals 
we believe that these sources of liquidity  together with anticipated product revenues and interest income  will not be sufficient to operate our business beyond june these factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
we are pursuing several alternatives to address this situation  including raising additional funding and the intended sale of the visualization technology business 
however  there can be no assurance that the requisite fundings or sale of the visualization technology business will be consummated in the necessary time frame or on terms acceptable to us 
should we be unable to raise sufficient funds  we may be required to curtail our operating plans and possibly relinquish rights to portions of our technology or products 
in addition  increases in expenses or delays in product development may adversely impact our cash position and require further cost reductions 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis  or at all  in the future 
borrowing arrangements in october  we secured a  line of credit facility the facility with a bank for one year with automatic yearly renewals 
the current line of credit agreement expires in october the facility is secured by qualified accounts receivable and bears interest at the rate of prime plus at december

new accounting pronouncements in january fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities was issued 
this interpretation requires a company to consolidate variable interest entities vie if the enterprise is a primary beneficiary holds a majority of the variable interest of the vie and the vie passes specific characteristics 
it also requires additional disclosures for parties involved with vies 
in december   the fasb issued a revision of interpretation no 
the revised interpretation 
revised interpretation codifies both the proposed modifications and other decisions previously issued through certain fasb staff positions fsps and supersedes the original interpretation no 
to include deferring the effective date of the interpretation s provisions for certain variable interests  providing additional scope exceptions for certain other variable interests  clarifying the impact of troubled debt restructurings on the requirement to reconsider a whether an entity is a vie or b which party is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and revising appendix b of the interpretation to provide additional guidance on what constitutes a variable interest 
accordingly  the company will adopt revised interpretation no 
effective the first quarter and does not expect the adoption of this interpretation will have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have an effect on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have a  credit facility with a financial institution 
interest on this facility was prime plus at december  at december   we had  in advances outstanding under this credit facility 
if we were to draw under this facility  changes in interest rates would affect the interest expense we would pay and could impact our cash flows and results of operations 
the maturity date of this credit facility is october  we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
