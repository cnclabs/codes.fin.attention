overview founded in  trio tech international provides third party semiconductor testing and burn in services primarily through its laboratories in southeast asia 
the company operates in three distinct segments sales  manufacturing  and testing 
at or from its facilities in california and southeast asia  the company also designs  manufactures and markets equipment and systems used in the testing and production of semiconductors  and distributes semiconductor processing and testing equipment manufactured by others 
i results of operations and business outlook the following table sets forth our revenue components for the past three years revenue components year ended june  june  june  net sales testing manufacturing distribution total geographically  we operate in the us  singapore  malaysia  thailand and ireland 
our customers are mainly concentrated in southeast asia and they are either semiconductor chip manufacturers or testing facilities that purchase our testing equipment 
our core business  testing services  experienced a decline in sales in the last fiscal year  especially in singapore  due to a fall in demand for certain products 
nevertheless  we are expecting an increasing trend for burn in services in southeast asia in fiscal with increased demand for a certain new type of burn in device 
however  we have yet to receive the confirmed backlog 
in fiscal  ireland operation received certification from one of its customers as an approved programming house 
the operation in ireland plans to continue to service existing customers and search for new business opportunities 
in addition  with the newly acquired burn in division in malaysia from a competitor  we managed to service a large electronic product manufacturer with whom we had been pursuing a business relationship for some time 
this acquisition benefited not only our testing segment  but also our manufacturing segment where we have higher sales for burn in boards 

table of contents we saw higher backlog from the singapore manufacturing operation towards the end of the year 
this increased backlog was derived mainly from burn in boards and smart burn in sbi electrical testers to test microprocessors  which were in high demand by our major customers in asia 
in fiscal  we anticipate that the business volume will come in mainly from southeast asia 
the us operation will continue to purchase refurbished equipment so that the operation can remain competitive in the used equipment market 
we anticipate that there will be a change in product mix for singapore distribution operation from low margin front end products to equipment sales according to the market trend 
the backlog for equipment sales increased by threefold  to in fiscal  mainly from vibration products and two new products  camera modules and film deposition systems 
camera modules and components  which are in the imaging technology industry  are in demand across the asian region  and film deposition systems are important for manufacturing process in semiconductor industries and research institutions 
the key performance indicators for the company are based on market demand 
sales activities such as bookings  backlog  and queries on products also formed part of our performance indicators  as well as customers forecasts and the financial results of customers and competitors 
statistics obtained from the semiconductor industry association sia give reasonable inference of the upward trend of electronic materials until  after which time no forecast has been given 
the sia report indicated that strong double digit billings growth is observed in all regions with the exception of north america 
the report also shows that asia makes up of the semiconductor market region 
taiwan and china are two regions experiencing the strongest year over year growth 
the company believes the current market trend indicates that the overall semiconductor market is responding to the increase in demand for computer and consumer electronics 
the activity level increased specifically in the information technology  medical and military markets 
increasing demand for equipment  including burn in systems and boards  can be seen in the asian region  china and india 
however  the semiconductor equipment capital spending budgets in the u 
s were reduced due to lower growth expectation in the next two quarters because of the slow economy in the us this resulted from  among other things  higher oil prices  an unstable mideast region and lower consumer confidence 
there are several influencing factors which create uncertainties when forecasting performance  such as the ever changing nature of technology  ie specific requirements from the customer  decline in demand for certain types of burn in devices or equipment  and other similar factors 
one of these factors is the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry 
another is that some customers are unable to provide a forecast of the products required for the next few weeks  hence it is difficult for our singapore manufacturing operation to plan out the resources needed to meet these customers requirements 
this will normally result in a lower margin for these products as it is more expensive to purchase materials in a short time frame 
however  the company has taken action to protect itself and formulated plans for dealing with these unpredictable factors 
for example  in order to meet customers demands on short notice  the operation has already begun to stockpile materials 
the drawback is that if customers cancel orders  the company is responsible for finding other buyers for these materials 
we will be instituting further cost cutting measures such as combining certain plants together  finding solutions to cut utilities rates  remaining economic in scale and maintaining a lean headcount  among others 
furthermore  we have begun subcontracting certain areas of manufacturing functions to ease supervisory and administrative work 
finally  the company is exploring new business opportunities such as selling new products 
ii financial information during the fiscal year ended june   total assets increased by  from  at june  to  at june  the majority of the increase was in short term deposits  other receivables and inventories  but offset with a decrease in investments in marketable securities of the increase in short term deposits of  from  at june  to  at june  mainly derived from cash proceeds from the disposal of marketable securities and the withdrawal of previously invested funds 
all of the of the investments in marketable securities at june  were sold in the first quarter of in order to take advantage of the increase in market value  utilize the profit and exit the market 
the company also withdrew previously invested funds of  which were held in trust by an independent investing firm  for further investment in the newly acquired burn in testing operation in malaysia 
cash decreased by from  at june  to  at june  as the company reinvested additional cash balances into short term deposits 
furthermore  the early repayment of a loan in singapore and the payment of bonuses contributed to the decrease in cash 
inventories increased by from june  to  at june  attributable to the singapore manufacturing and distribution operations 
the singapore manufacturing operation began work on new orders and turned the finished goods into revenue towards the end of fourth quarter 
on the other hand  the singapore distribution operation purchased inventories  which 
table of contents happened to be in transit  to cater to the higher backlog as of june  as a result  the work in progress increased by  which was offset with a decrease in finished goods of the increase in other receivables also contributed to the increase in total assets 
the increase in other receivables mainly derived from the down payment for the renovation of sbi smart burn in facilities of in singapore as well as the deposit of paid for the acquisition of the testing operation in malaysia 
these offset the withdrawal of previously invested funds of from the independent investing firm  which withdrawal is described above 
total liabilities at june  were  reflecting an increase from  at june  accounts payable at june  increased by  since june  due mainly to a rise in quantity of materials purchased before payment for a few of the operations in southeast asia at the end of the fourth quarter 
this was offset by a decrease in lines of credit  notes payable and capitalized leases as a result of net payments of  and respectively 
during the year fiscal  universal systems negotiated with the bank to terminate the capitalized lease assets with an early redemption of before relocating its operation and assets from san jose  california to another subsidiary in singapore 
as of june   total liabilities excluding minority interest were of total capital  compared with at june  total liabilities as a percentage of total capital was higher in fiscal mainly due to higher accounts payable  as mentioned earlier 
the company believes its strong cash position provides ready and ample access to funds in the global capital market 
critical accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions 
in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policy  we identified the most critical accounting principles upon which its financial statements depend 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts during the normal course of business  we extend unsecured credit to its customers 
typically credit terms require payment to be made between to days of the sale 
we do not require collateral from its customers 
we maintain our cash accounts at credit worthy financial institutions 
we regularly evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of each customer on a case by case basis 
we include any account balances that are determined to be uncollectible  along with a general reserve  in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available to management  we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of june  inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  shore term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we write down inventories for not saleable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods by charging such write downs to cost of sales 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  statistics and judgments are used for assessing provision of the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence 
in fiscal  certain inventories with provision were sold in connection with products sales generating zero or little margin  which led to the reduction of inventory provision and contributed partially a flat margin in the product sales generated in manufacturing segment 
revenue recognition revenues generated from sales of products in manufacturing and distribution segments are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the products has occurred  customer acceptance has been obtained  which means the significant risks and rewards of the ownership have been transferred to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and 
table of contents collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain products sold in manufacturing segment may require installation and training to be performed 
revenue from product sales is also recorded in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf statement revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements which generally requires revenue earned on product sales involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
we allocate a portion of the invoice value to products sold and the remaining portion of invoice value to installation work in proportion of the fair value of products sold and installation work to be performed 
training elements are valued based on hourly rates  which we charge for these services when sold apart from product sales 
the fair value determination of products sold and the installation and training work is also based on our specific historical experience of the relative fair values of the elements if there is no easily determinable market price to be considered 
in fiscal and  the installation revenues generated in connection with product sales were immaterial and included in the product sales revenue line on the consolidated statement of income 
we estimate an allowance for sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
revenue derived from testing service is recognized when testing services are rendered 
income tax we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for income taxes sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
our foreign subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the regions where they operate 
because of the different income tax jurisdictions  net losses generated in the us cannot be utilized to offset the taxable income generated in foreign countries 
therefore  we may incur certain income tax expenses in any fiscal year 
for us income tax purposes  no provision has been made for us taxes on undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries  with which the company intends to continue to reinvest 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings if they were remitted as dividends  were lent to the company  or if the company should sell its stock in the subsidiary 
however  the company believes that us foreign tax credits and net operating losses available would substantially eliminate any additional tax effects 
impairment of long lived assets effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
whenever any such impairment exists  an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 

table of contents results of operations comparison of year ended june  and june  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss gain loss on disposal of pp e total operating expenses income from operations overall net sales and gross margin overall sales for fiscal were  down  from fiscal by a difference of 
this decrease in sales was primarily due to the significant drop in sales in the distribution segment  as well as decreased activity in the testing segment  both of which offset the surge in sales in the manufacturing segment  especially in the fourth quarter 
overall gross margin increased marginally by less than from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily attributable to the distribution segment even though sales in that segment decreased significantly 
distribution segment the revenue and gross margin for the distribution segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin net sales in the distribution segment decreased  a decrease of  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the bulk of the sales decline was attributable to the decrease in unit volume of low margin products  which experienced a reduction in sales revenue of  from fiscal to fiscal  along with a drop in quantity sold and a reduction in selling price 
sales of vibration products and reflow ovens fell by  with a drop of in quantity sold 
the demand for vibration products diminished as this equipment had an average unit selling price greater than customers in the united states remained conservative in making large investments  hence demand was low 
customers showed a preference to purchase substitute equipment at an average selling price below as for reflow ovens  customers developed more stringent requirements in technology  and our existing vendor was unable to satisfy the change 
we will continue to search for other vendors who can meet our customers requirements 
however  the unit selling price of vibration products and reflows ovens increased by over fiscal due to our ability to meet customers specialized demands  hence their willingness to pay more for this benefit 
additionally  spare parts and services increased sales by despite the decline in sales in the distribution segment overall  the margin showed an improvement of from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the decreased sales of low margin products combined with the improvement in average unit selling price of vibration products and reflow ovens 
this contributed mainly to the slight improvement in the overall gross margin compared to fiscal 
table of contents testing segment the revenue and gross margin for the testing segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the testing segment also experienced some deterioration in sales 
sales dropped by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal burn in volume for this segment decreased due to a change in customers burn in requirements 
we adjusted to meet these specifications  but still suffered a lower margin of from fiscal because of operating with fixed costs 
also contributing was the fall in product life cycle for one particular type of burn in  and one new type of burn in has yet to ramp up as expected 
additionally  we adopted a reduction in service fees of approximately in an effort to maintain existing customers and attract new ones in an increasingly competitive market 
gross margin dropped by  from in fiscal to in fiscal due to several factors 
first  the company reduced service fees in an effort to retain existing customers and capture new ones in an increasingly competitive market 
second  material costs  such as utilities  increased due to higher usage of certain products and some new administrative charges from the vendor of utilities were imposed 
in order to counter the above  the singapore testing operation is working diligently to obtain more business for the latest type of burn in  and will be closely monitoring costs to maintain them at the minimum level 
although the thailand operation saw boosted sales in fiscal  it generated a lower margin due to a change in product mix  as more services at a lower margin were provided to one particular customer with whom trio tech has a long standing relationship 
manufacturing segment the revenue and gross margin for the manufacturing segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the setbacks in sales in the testing and distribution segments were partially offset by an improvement in sales in the manufacturing segment  resulting an overall increase in sales of from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the market conditions for the microelectronics market remained positive as indicated by the improved backlog  which increased from in fiscal to  in fiscal sales of burn in systems and burn in boards increased  as did sales derived from fabrication and upgrading customers equipment 
the singapore manufacturing operation was chosen by a customer to be its major supplier to build systems for the testing of microprocessor  and anticipates that it will continue to provide this service 
this same operation also procured the business of burn in boards sales to its new customer 
sales of burn in boards were in fiscal  an increase in the quantity sold of with a drop in unit selling price of 
sales of burn in systems were  a increase in quantity sold and a decrease in unit selling price over fiscal even though the unit selling price decreased for all these products  the dollar volume resulting from the substantial increase in the quantity sold of burn in boards and burn in systems exceeded the dollar volume resulting from the drop in selling price 
the sales of artic temperature controlled chucks contributed the decrease of due to the decrease in both quantity and the unit selling price 
gross margin as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat at  but the dollar volume increased by from in fiscal to  in fiscal  which was consistent with the increase in sales 
another factor which contributed to a flat margin was due to the sale of certain inventories with provision generating zero or little margin 
geographically  net sales into and within the united states region decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the drop in demand in the us for front end products from the singapore distribution segment contributed to of the decline 
it was also due in part to the decline in demand for artic temperature controlled chucks as semiconductor equipment capital spending budgets in the us appear to have been reduced based on lower growth expectations for the second half of in addition  the us manufacturing operation was moved from san jose  california to singapore at the very end of the third quarter  hence we predict a temporary lack of bookings for wet process stations while we prepare for the manufacturing process and determine the needs of the customers in this new region 
net sales into and within ireland increased  from in fiscal from  in fiscal responsible for the increase was a boost in programming 
table of contents services in the ireland operation 
net sales into and within the southeast asia region increased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as there was higher demand for burn in boards and systems in malaysia and singapore 
operating expenses the operating expenses for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss gain loss on disposal of pp e as a percentage of sales  operating expenses dropped by from in fiscal to in fiscal this was a result of the slight movements in all the operating expense items as a percentage of sales 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased slightly by from in fiscal to in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by from fiscal to fiscal several factors contributed to this reduction  including diminished bonus provisions of in the singapore operation as a few of the operations did not meet their bonus payment criteria 
salaries were cut back by in southeast asia and in the united states operation as part of cost cutting measures 
insurance and rental diminished by in universal systems after the operation along with its assets were moved from san jose  california to singapore 
in fiscal  the company granted certain stock options which had an exercise price less than that of the fair market value resulting in a compensation cost 
in fiscal  as all options were granted at fair market value  no similar compensation costs were incurred 
finally  miscellaneous costs fell by this was all offset by higher depreciation of due to renovations and additional purchases of equipment in southeast asia  addition withholding tax of from malaysia operation  additional provision for doubtful debts of  and incremental tele communication expenses of due to overseas travel 
additionally  a reversal in provision for contingent liabilities of occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  as the court case was settled in favor of trio tech and we were not liable for the compensation 
no such reversal of provision occurred in likewise  in fiscal corporate officers bonuses in the amount of were paid  whereas in fiscal  in bonuses were reversed out as the group did not meet its bonus payment criteria as a percentage of sales  selling expenses increased marginally by from in fiscal to in selling expenses as a whole increased by one reason for this was the increase in commission of in the us operation due to a higher number of commissionable sales  and a increase in commissions in singapore manufacturing and distribution for the same reason 
another reason was the higher warranty cost of due to more numerous equipment sales for the singapore manufacturing and distribution segments 
higher travel costs of were incurred in singapore mainly for the purpose of transferring the manufacturing of wet process stations from san jose to singapore 
greater participation in semiconductor shows and conferences resulted in higher trade show costs of for fiscal finally  there was an increase in miscellaneous costs of this was offset with a reduction in salaries of in the southeast asia operation through a reduction in headcount 
also  there was a savings of in salaries in the us as the sales staff at universal systems was laid off in the third quarter of  and a savings in rent and utilities of as this same facility was closed down 
research and development remained relatively flat from fiscal to fiscal gain loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment the loss on disposal of fixed assets of in fiscal  was related to the write off of obsolete burn in facilities in southeast asia in fiscal on the other hand  the gain on disposal of in fiscal was derived from the ireland and thailand operations 
ireland operation sold equipment which had been written off several years ago  hence enabling us to recognize of the sales proceeds as a total gain for the operation 
also  the thailand operation made a substantial sale of boards to one of its customers  realizing a gain of 
table of contents income loss from operations the income loss from operations for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited manufacturing segment testing segment distribution segment corporate the company turned the operating loss of in fiscal to an operating income of in fiscal the improvement was mainly attributed to the manufacturing and distribution segments  which have more than offset the decline in operating income for the testing segment 
the operating loss in the manufacturing segment declined by  from in fiscal to in fiscal the reduction in operating loss resulted in part from the transfer of the universal systems manufacturing operation from san jose to singapore in the third quarter of hence  certain fixed costs which were incurred in fiscal were not repeated in fiscal general administrative costs as a percentage of sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  while selling expenses as a percentage of sales dropped from to  mainly due to the significant rise in sales of 
the decline in general administrative costs of and selling expenses of as a percentage of sales was mainly attributed to universal system 
after universal system moved its manufacturing operation  along with all its equipment  to trio tech international pte 
ltd 
in singapore  this resulted in a savings in high fixed costs  such as salaries of  rental of  commissions of  and research and development costs of when compared to fiscal the distribution segment also contributed to the improvement in operating income 
its operating loss decreased by from in fiscal to in fiscal this improvement was mainly due to the change in product mix  which improved gross margin as mentioned earlier 
operating expenses for vibration products and reflow ovens remained similar to those in fiscal which  along with the increase in price  contributed to the decrease in operating loss for the distribution segment 
corporate also contributed to the improvement in the overall operating income 
the corporate office attempts to reimburse its operating expenses by imposing a fee to all subsidiaries on a fixed percentage of total revenue 
due to the increase in singapore manufacturing sales in the fourth quarter  while the rate remained unchanged  the fees collected in fiscal were more than corporate operating expenses 
this is unlikely to recur in fiscal hence  corporate went from an operating loss of in fiscal to an operating income of in fiscal  an increase of the above were more than enough to offset the decrease in operating income for the testing segment  which declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the testing segment  comprised of fixed and semi fixed costs such as rental  depreciation  and administrative salaries  remained fixed despite the overall decrease in sales 
with the increase in cost of goods sold as mentioned earlier due to higher utilities costs  the operating income declined by interest expense the interest expenses for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited interest expense interest expense decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal one reason for this was the lower interest incurred on lines of credit as the singapore and us operations repaid their lines of credit during the end of and the beginning of also  lower interest was incurred on a term loan in the singapore operation as most of its loan was repaid 
offsetting this was the interest from additional borrowings obtained for the building of extensions  burn in systems and other equipment during the year by the singapore operation 
other income other income for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited other income 
table of contents other income increased from fiscal to fiscal one contributing factor to this was increased rental income due to the leasing out of factories in ireland and malaysia  which contributed another cause was increased net gain on disposal of marketable securities of offsetting these increases was a loss on currency exchange of in versus an exchange gain of in for a total difference of also  we experienced a decrease of in dividends and interest income  a decline in royalty income of  a drop of in sundry income  and a decrease of in miscellaneous income 
income tax the total income tax provision decreased by or  from in fiscal to in fiscal of the change of  there was an increase of related to the current portion of income tax due to the increase of in foreign income tax provision and a decrease of in state income tax provision compared to those in fiscal the rest was related to the deferred portion of income taxes benefit 
an increase of in current portion of foreign income tax expense was a result of tax provision of approximately incurred in ireland operation due to the gain of on disposal of equipment and the remaining of current portion of income tax provision incurred in malaysia operation due to the increase in its operating income 
the deferred income tax portion was changed from provision of in fiscal to benefit of in fiscal the swing was approximately  which was attributed to a decrease of deferred tax liability incurred mainly in singapore 
the decrease in deferred income tax expense was the result of the timing differences related to the recording of depreciation expenses for book and tax purposes and net operating loss carried forward in singapore and malaysia 
we did not recognize any income tax benefits related to the net operating losses generated in the us we believe that when the future taxable income exceeds the cumulative losses  it is likely that such benefits will be realized 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal was due to a change from net loss of before income tax to net income of before income tax and due to a change in the income tax provision of in fiscal to income tax provision of in fiscal as discussed above  the decrease of deferred tax liability in singapore contributed to the decrease of total income tax provision which in turn contributed to the decrease of effective income tax rate 
in addition  the net loss in the us was decrease from in fiscal to in fiscal and net income in foreign countries increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  both of which contributed to the decrease of effective income tax rate 
the company files income tax returns in the us  singapore  thailand  malaysia  and ireland  respectively 
income taxes are provided in those countries where taxable income is earned 
income in one country is not offset by losses in another country 
accordingly  no benefit is provided for losses in the countries except where the loss can be carried back against income recognized in previous years 
in essence  the effect of providing tax against taxable income while not providing benefit for losses results in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate 
the nature and terms of income tax holidays  abatements  rate reductions and similar arrangements granted by foreign taxing authorities and their impact on the provision for income taxes are as follows capital allowances are available in the southeast asia operation to offset taxable income  which is the same as accelerated allowance on fixed assets 
this reduces the income tax payable and creates deferred tax liabilities for the next few years 
reinvestment allowances can only offset the tax payable if the expansion  modernization or diversification is carried out in a promoted area 
net loss income as a result of all of the factors analyzed above  the net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately  which represented an increase of from a net loss of for fiscal  or a change 
basic earnings per share for fiscal increased to per share from a basic loss per share of in fiscal  which represented an increase of  a change 
diluted earnings per share for fiscal was per share  an increase of per share from a diluted loss per share of for fiscal 
table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss gain loss on disposal of pp e total operating expenses income from operations overall net sales and gross margin net sales for the company increased overall by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a difference of  the increase in sales was primarily derived from the distribution and testing segments  which offset the decrease in sales in the manufacturing segment 
overall gross margin increased by from in fiscal to in fiscal the greater portion of this increase was attributable to the manufacturing segment  which recovered from a loss to a positive gross margin in spite of a drop in sales 
distribution segment the revenue and gross margin for the distribution segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the distribution segment sales increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to a surge in sales of low margin front end products 
an additional low margin front end product of a similar nature to that of our existing products was responsible for this surge 
sales of low margin products were  a decline in quantity sold but a increase in the selling price  whereas the sales of test chambers and reflow ovens were in fiscal with a rise in quantity sold and a drop in selling price of 
test chambers and reflow ovens were also in higher demand as we were able to keep the cost of these machines reasonably priced with a selling price ranging from to  which fell within customers capital budgets 
gross margin dropped by  from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to fierce competition in the capital equipment market and the decrease in customers capital spending budgets 
conversely  some customers took advantage of price reductions to obtain necessary equipment  which also impacted our gross margin 
the increase in sales volume for test chambers and reflow ovens was not sufficient to offset the effects of the price reduction 
testing segment the revenue and gross margin for the testing segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the testing segment also experienced an increase in sales in the thailand and singapore operations  where sales increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the thailand operation secured new contracts from existing customers  as well as 
table of contents secured new customers  and one particular type of burn in device was in high demand from the testing operation in singapore 
however  one particular customer in malaysia shifted their production to thailand  and revenue from this customer decreased in anticipation of this relocation 
as a result  sales were not as high as they otherwise may have been 
gross margin as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat at  but the margin in dollars increased by to  in fiscal  which was consistent with the increase in sales 
manufacturing segment the revenue and gross margin for the manufacturing segment for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited revenue gross margin the increase in the distribution and testing sales was offset by a decrease in sales in the manufacturing segment  which was mainly attributable to the united states operation 
the net sales in the manufacturing segment experienced a general decline of  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the continued pessimistic outlook of the electronics industry and the threat of war in the middle east for most of fiscal forced manufacturers to delay capital spending 
customers remained conservative in spending due to the overall pessimistic outlook of the electronics industry 
sales of artic temperature controlled chucks dropped  a decrease in quantity sold and a decrease in the selling price 
rate turn tables sales fell  a reduction in quantity sold with no change in selling price  and were completely fazed out in fiscal sales of environmental test equipment dropped  a decline in quantity sold with a drop in selling price 
fortunately  the decline in manufacturing segment sales was offset by an increase in sales of burn in systems as a result of our ability to meet customers specialized demands  and therefore the ability to charge more for these products 
the sales of burn in boards fell  a drop in quantity sold and a reduction in the selling price 
this overall decline was offset by a climb in sales of burn in systems of  with a decrease in quantity sold but a increase in selling price 
wet process stations sales increased by in spite of a decrease in quantity sold  due to a hike in selling price 
hast equipment sales rose due to a growth in quantity sold and a decrease in selling price 
despite the decrease in manufacturing segment sales  the gross margin increased from a negative in fiscal to a positive in fiscal mainly due lower cost of goods sold incurred in fiscal this increase in fact contributed to the bulk of the improvement in the overall gross margin for the company 
the cost of goods sold included an inventory obsolescence of in the united states operation in  which did not recur in likewise  lower depreciation expenses of incurred as no depreciation was charged on fixed assets that were impaired in fiscal and did not recur in fiscal finally  the united states operations reduced headcount as part of cost cutting measures thereby reducing payroll related costs by geographically  net sales into and within the united states increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this was a result of an increasing demand in the us for front end products from the distribution segment in singapore and hast equipment from one of the local operations 
net sales into and within the southeast asia region increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily attributable to a new burn in testing service in the thailand operation and an increase in demand for burn in equipment in singapore as a result of the ability to meet customers specifications 
net sales into and within ireland and other countries decreased by from  in fiscal to in fiscal due to a decline in demand for testing services  which occurred when several large customers moved out of europe  and lower manufacturing sales from singapore and the unites states into europe and other countries as well 
operating expenses the operating expenses for fiscal and were as follows in thousands  unaudited general and administrative selling research and development impairment loss gain on disposal of pp e 
table of contents operating expenses decreased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  our operating expenses in fiscal decreased from to in fiscal general and administrative g a expenses decreased by or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a percentage of sales  g a decreased by from in to in fiscal although we experienced a decrease in g a during fiscal as a result of a decrease in payroll related expenses  primarily in the us operations  such decrease was offset by a increase in payroll expenses in southeast asia as operations there increased based on increased sales 
in addition  we had a decrease in rental  relocation  and insurance expenses due to relocation to smaller facilities in van nuys  california in  and a decrease in depreciation expense as no depreciation was charged on fixed assets that were impaired in fiscal and did not recur in fiscal selling expenses decreased by or from  in fiscal to in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal of the  was related to a decrease in commission expense as a result of a decrease in commission related sales in the distribution and manufacturing segments  was related to a decrease in warranty expenses incurred in southeast asia  reflecting the fact that the amount of products sold requiring warranty was reduced in fiscal  a decrease was due to an impairment loss recorded in fiscal which did not recur in fiscal  an approximate decrease in travel and related costs was due to fewer sales trips made in the second half of fiscal as a result of the iraq war and the sars outbreak in asia  and a decrease in other expense items was a result of cost cutting measures implemented during fiscal research and development expense decreased by or from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to management s decision to reduce research and development activities on its wet process stations and artic temperature controlled chucks  based on reduced demand for these customized products in the manufacturing segment 
impairment loss impairment loss decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease of  was primarily due to the remaining fixed and intangible assets written to their fair value in fiscal  which were not written down previously 
the company recorded an impairment loss based on its examination of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the subsidiaries where certain long lived assets certain fixed assets were used 
the impairment loss of in fiscal consisted of machinery and equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements pertaining to the malaysia and singapore testing operations due to changes in demand for certain burn in services which in turn made certain of our existing burn in facilities obsolete 
gain loss on sale of property  plant and equipment the disposal of property  plant and equipment resulted in a decrease of from a gain of in fiscal to a loss of in fiscal the disposal loss was related to the disposal of the obsolete burn in facilities in southeast asia due to new developments and advancement in technology 
income loss from operations the income loss from operations for fiscal years and were as follow in thousands  unaudited manufacturing segment testing segment distribution segment corporate the substantial reduction in the operating loss from  in fiscal  to in fiscal was mainly attributed to the manufacturing and testing segment and corporate  which have more than to offset the increase in operating loss for distribution segment 
the operating loss in manufacturing segment decreased by  from  in fiscal to in fiscal  mainly due to lower cost of goods sold as mentioned earlier 
in addition  the operating expenses further decreased such as the reduction of  in impairment loss of machinery and equipment was recorded in fiscal but was not repeated in fiscal no depreciation was charged on the machinery and equipment that were impaired in fiscal  hence there was a reduction of 
table of contents in depreciation expense in fiscal payroll related expenses were reduced by as a part of cost cutting measures implemented in fiscal concurrently  rental  insurance  travel  legal and auditing fees and commission were cut by for the same reason 
finally  a reduction in research and development costs resulted in a savings of due to a change in demand for products sold by our manufacturing segment 
testing segment and corporate also contributed to the reduction in operating loss 
the operating loss for testing segment increased by from in fiscal to in fiscal its operating expenses decreased mainly due to the impairment loss of which consisted of machinery and equipment  furniture  and leasehold improvements pertaining to the malaysia and singapore operations recorded in fiscal but was not repeated in fiscal the operating loss in corporate reduced from in fiscal to in fiscal due to an increase in allocated charges on the subsidiaries  which was contributed from a significant reduction in sales for one particular product with a lower allocated charge 
this was offset by the increase in tax fees of for the appointment of a new firm to assist in the tax computation rather than computing internally 
additionally  compensation costs of were charged because of the grant of certain stock options with an exercise price at less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock 
the above were more than to offset the increase in operating loss for distribution segment  which increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  mainly attributed to the decrease in gross margin mentioned earlier 
despite there was a significant increase in distribution segment sales  the operating loss did not reduce as the bulk of the sales increase derived from low margin front end products 
hence  the margin that derived from such products was minimal 
interest expenses the interest expenses for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands  unaudited interest expense interest expense decreased by or  from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to net repayments of on the line of credit and payments of  on long term debt and capitalized leases 
other income the other income for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands  unaudited other income other income increased by or from in fiscal to in fiscal changes in other income in fiscal compared to those in fiscal consisted mainly of an increase in gain on disposal of marketable securities of  an increase in exchange gain of in fiscal and  a decrease in interest income of in fiscal income tax the total income tax provision increased by or from in fiscal to in fiscal of the change of  was related to the current portion of income tax due to the increase of in foreign income tax expense and in state income tax expense compared to those in fiscal the remaining related to the deferred portion of income taxes expense 
the increase of in current foreign income tax expense was a result of an increase in income in thailand from a loss of in fiscal to an income of in fiscal  which was offset by the decrease in income in singapore of in fiscal to in fiscal though singapore had a higher income in fiscal  the allowance on depreciation for tax purposes reduced the taxable income and thus resulted in a lower tax provision in fiscal the deferred portion of income tax provision increased by from in fiscal to in fiscal  which was attributed to the increase in the deferred tax liability incurred mainly in singapore 
the increase in deferred income tax expense was the result of the timing differences related to the recording of depreciation expense for book and tax purposes 
we did not recognize any income tax benefits related to the losses generated in the us we believe that when the future taxable income exceeds the cumulative losses  it is likely that such benefits will be realized 
the company s effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal was due to the decrease in net loss generated in the us and the increase in the net income before taxes generated by the operations conducted in foreign countries 
in addition  the net loss incurred in the us cannot offset the 
table of contents taxable income in singapore and thailand 
therefore  the main portion of income tax expense of was incurred in singapore and thailand 
the company files income tax returns in the us  singapore  thailand  malaysia  and ireland  respectively 
income taxes are provided in those countries where taxable income is earned 
income in one country is not offset by losses in another country 
accordingly  no benefit is provided for losses in the countries except where the loss can be carried back against income recognized in previous years 
this has the effect of providing tax against taxable income while not providing benefit for losses  which results in an effective tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate 
the nature and terms of income tax holidays  abatements  rate reductions and similar arrangements granted by foreign taxing authorities and their impact on the provision for income taxes are as follows capital allowances are available in the southeast asia operations to offset taxable income  which is the same as accelerated allowance on fixed assets 
this reduces the income tax payable and creates deferred tax liabilities for the next few years 
reinvestment allowances can only offset the tax payable if the expansion  modernization or diversification is carried out in a promoted area 
net loss income as a result of all of the factors analyzed above  the net loss for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately  which represented a decrease in losses of  from a net loss of  for fiscal  or a change 
basic loss per share for fiscal decreased to per share  from a basic loss per share of in fiscal  which represented a decrease of  a change 
diluted loss per share for fiscal was per share  a decrease of per share from diluted loss per share of for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we believe our financial condition is strong 
the working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities of  as of june  increased by  or  compared to working capital of  as of june  the current ratio defined as current assets divided by current liabilities was times as of june  compared to as of june  the company had positive working capital for the ten fiscal years prior to the year ended june  we believe that the company has the ability to maintain positive working capital and strong liquidity in the near future 
management believes the company has the economic wherewithal to satisfy any short term funding for several reasons 
we have cash provided by operating activities of  after adjusting for non cash items and movements in working capital and our collection of accounts receivable is approximately days which is consistent with last year and is adequate for our purposes 
furthermore  the manufacturing operation in san jose  california  which consistently showed a loss  was moved to singapore without additional work force 
we anticipate that it will ease the working capital used to finance that operation 
the burn in testing operation in malaysia acquired on july  will need significant capital expenditure of to renovate the office  plant and facilities for new products  replace existing equipments and purchase new equipments 
currently  internal funding is used for the first two payment of for the total acquisition cost of approximately  ringgit malaysian the balance of the purchase price for this burn in operation of approximately  ringgit malaysian was paid in the form of a bank guaranteed which will mature in six months at december  in addition  the backlog from singapore manufacturing ramped up beginning in the last quarter of fiscal accordingly  we anticipate that there will be more purchases of raw materials to meet the orders in the next few quarters  and the unused credit facilities will be utilized to fund this area 
at june   the company had available short term lines of credit totaling  of which  was unused 
however  of this  the line of credit of trio tech singapore of  expired in july the company anticipates that it will renew this line of credit at a later date 
entity with facility type of interest credit unused trio tech malaysia line of credit trio tech bangkok line of credit trio tech singapore line of credit to   
table of contents the company procured long term loans of and capitalized leases of in fiscal to finance capital purchases  and another loan of approximately  has yet to be drawn down 
the following contractual obligations servicing table describes our overall future cash obligations based on various current contracts in the next five years payments due by period at june  less than after total year years years years lines of credit notes payable capital leases operating leases other requirements will be for the expansion of the new distribution operation in singapore  where we anticipate the purchase of raw materials for wet process stations and for new products 
there were no other capital commitments except those that were disclosed as of june  
fiscal net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended june  doubled from net cash of provided by operating activities during the year ended june  to a net cash of  movements in working capital included increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  over june  was mainly due to larger orders for purchase of materials  especially in the singapore operation  to meet orders in the first quarter of there was a sudden increase in our manufacturing backlog in  which went from in june to  in june however  accounts receivable decreased by at june  as compared to june  this was mainly attributable to the lower sales generated from the singapore testing and distribution operation 
as a result  sales in southeast asia decreased by to  in the last quarter of fiscal as compared to the same quarter in fiscal nevertheless  the accounts receivable turnover index defined as net sales divided by average ending accounts receivable less bad debt allowance remains consistent at times at june  and  indicating that the company remains efficient in its collection 
inventories decreased by at june  as compared to june   which was mainly attributed to the decline in inventories of in universal system 
these inventories were either turned into finished goods and sold off or transferred to singapore in the third quarter of fiscal  none was in the operation thereafter 
the provision for stock obsolescence in universal systems of was written off after the transfer and the carry value of the inventories was taken up in the singapore subsidiary 
on the other hand  the singapore manufacturing operation and distribution operation started to stock up inventories during the fourth quarter of fiscal  to work on new orders and to cater for the higher backlog as of june  hence  the inventory turnover index defined as cost of sales divided by average ending inventory was times at june   down from times at june  the bulk of the cash provided from investing activities during the year was invested in short term deposits  because of our view that cash will be required in the short term for new investments in malaysia 
the investments in short term deposits increased  from  in june  to  in june  this contributed mainly to the net cash used in investing activities during the year ended june  of  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  during the year ended june  in addition  capital expenditures increased by in mainly due to the acquisition of burn in systems and the extension of a building 
these were offset with the higher proceeds of mainly from sales of equipment and lower purchase of marketable securities of in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended june  was  reflecting a decrease of  compared to the  used in financing activities during out of the decrease of   was due to lower net repayment on lines of credit  debt and capitalized leases during the year ended june  compared to net repayments of  for the year ended june  in addition  cash of was received from stock options exercised during the year ended june  approximately  of short term deposits as of june  is held in the company s owned malaysian subsidiary 
of such amount   is denominated in the currency of malaysia  of which is currently available for movement 
table of contents overseas  as authorized by the central bank of malaysia 
there are additional amounts available as dividends after making deductions for income tax pursuant to malaysian regulations 
fiscal net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended june  was  reflecting a significant increase of  compared to a net cash of  used in operating activities during the year ended june  movements in working capital included increases in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable of was mainly attributable to the higher net sales of for the fiscal year ended june  compared to june  the increased sales were the primary factor in the improvement in the accounts receivable turnover 
the accounts receivable turnover index defined as net sales divided by average ending accounts receivable less bad debt allowance totaled times as at june   compared with times at june  also indicating that the company believes that the foregoing reflects its consistent emphasis on the collection of accounts receivable 
accounts payables and accrued expense increased by  over june  mainly due to an increase in purchases of finished goods in one of the u 
s operations to cater for the sudden increase in their backlog from as at june  to  as at june  in addition  a potential sales rebate of was accrued in the singapore operation after finalization of pricing with a customer 
however  inventory decreased by at june  as compared to june   which was due to the improvement in the inventory turnover index 
the inventory turnover index defined as cost of sales divided by average ending inventory was times at june   up from times at june  net cash provided from investing activities increased from  at june  to  at june  the change was contributed mainly from higher proceeds from disposal of marketable securities of  an increase in short term deposits of and a reduction in purchases on marketable securities of this was offset with an increase in capital expenditures of in the testing segment for business expansion in southeast asia and lower proceeds from sales of equipment by net cash used in financing activities during the year ended june  was  reflecting a decrease of  compared to provided by financing activities during the year ended june  out of the decrease of   was due to lower net repayment on lines of credit  debt and capitalized leases during the year ended june  compared to net borrowings of for the year ended june  in addition  higher dividends of were paid out to the minority interest during the year ended june  approximately of cash deposits as of june  is held in the company s owned malaysian subsidiary 
of such amounts  was denominated in the currency of malaysia  of which is currently available for movement overseas  as authorized by the central bank of malaysia 
there are additional amounts available as dividends after making deductions for income tax pursuant to malaysian regulations 
corporate guarantee arrangement the company provides a corporate guarantee to one of its subsidiaries in southeast asia of approximately  to secure line of credit and term loans from a bank to finance the operations of such subsidiary 
with the strong financial position of the subsidiary company  the company believes this corporate guarantee arrangement will have no material impact on its liquidity or capital resources 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin  as amended by fin r  issued in january  requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin r are applicable for fiscal years ending after december  the company does not have any variable interest entities that must be consolidated 
certain risks that may affect our future results we hereby caution stockholders  prospective investors in trio tech international and other readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our stock price or cause our actual results for 
table of contents the fiscal year ending june  and future fiscal years and quarters to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements  oral or written  made by or on behalf of us 
our operating results are affected by a variety of factors our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially affect revenues and profitability or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results 
these factors include  among others  components relating to economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry  market acceptance of our products and services  changes in technologies in the semiconductor industry  which could affect demand for our products and services  changes in testing processes  the impact of competition  the lack of long term purchase or supply agreements with customers and vendors  changes in military or commercial testing specifications  which could affect the market for our products and services  difficulties in profitably integrating acquired businesses  if any  into the company  the loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled employees  international political or economic events  currency fluctuations  and other technological  economic  financial and regulatory factors beyond our control 
unfavorable changes in these or other factors could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to generate revenue growth and any revenue growth that is achieved may not be sustained 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected if operating expenses increase and are not subsequently followed by increased revenues 
the semiconductor industry cycles affect our business our business depends primarily upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  assemblers and other testing companies worldwide 
these industries in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing semiconductor devices 
the global semiconductor industry generally  and the semiconductor testing equipment industry in particular  are volatile and cyclical  with periodic capacity shortages and excess capacity 
in periods of excess capacity  the industry sharply cuts its purchases of capital equipment  including our distributed products  and reduces testing volumes  including our testing services 
excess capacity also causes downward pressure on the selling prices of our products and services 
our operating results have been adversely affected by past downturns and slowdowns 
there is no assurance that there will not be downturns or slowdowns in the future that may adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
in addition  if one or more of our primary customers reduces its or their purchases or use of our products or testing services  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we anticipate that we will continue to be primarily dependent on the semiconductor industry for the foreseeable future 
rapid technological changes may make our products obsolete or result in decreased prices or increased expenses technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor industry and may make our services or products obsolete 
advances in technology may lead to significant price erosion for products which we test with our older testing technologies 
our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and offer more advanced testing technologies and processes in the future  to anticipate both future demand and the technology to supply that demand  to enhance our current products and services  to provide those products and services at competitive prices on a timely and cost effective basis and to achieve market acceptance of those products and services 
to accomplish these goals  we may be required to incur significant engineering expenses 
as new products or services are introduced  we may experience warranty claims or product returns 
we may not be able to accomplish these goals correctly or timely enough 
if we fail in our efforts  our products and services may become obsolete or less competitive 
our dependence on international sales involves significant risk sales and services to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
approximately  and of our net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  were generated from business in southeast asia 
we expect that our non us sales and services will continue to generate the major part of our future revenues 
testing services in southeast asia were performed primarily for american companies  and to a lesser extent german companies  selling products and doing business in those regions 

table of contents international business operations may be adversely affected by many factors including fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  trade restrictions  political  economic and business events and social and cultural differences 
we may incur losses due to foreign currency fluctuations significant portions of our revenues are denominated in singapore and euro dollars  malaysian ringgit  thai baht and other currencies 
consequently  a portion of our costs  revenues and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and such foreign currencies 
we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates if there is a mismatch between our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal  an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal and an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal we try to reduce our risk of foreign currency fluctuations by purchasing certain equipment and supplies in us dollars and seeking payment  when possible  in us dollars 
however  we may not be successful in our attempts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
those fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
we do not rely on patents to protect our products or technology we hold us patents relating to our pressurization humidity testing equipment and certain aspects of our artic temperature test systems 
additionally  in fiscal  we were granted patents for certain aspects of our new ranges of artic temperature controlled chucks 
however  although we believe our patents are integral to our business  generally we do not rely on patent or trade secret protection for our products or technology 
competitors may develop technologies similar to or more advanced than ours 
we cannot assure you that our current or future products will not be copied or will not infringe on the patents of others 
moreover  the cost of litigation of any claim or damages resulting from infringement of patents or other intellectual property could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition can adversely affect our operating results the semiconductor equipment and testing industries are intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors include price  technical capabilities  quality  automation  reliability  product availability and customer service 
we face competition from established and potential new competitors  many of whom have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than our resources 
new products or testing facilities offered by our competitors could cause a decline in our revenues or a loss of market acceptance of our existing products and services 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition 
price based competition may result in lower prices  adversely affecting our operating results 
loss  reduction or delay of orders from significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large manufacturers and assemblers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenues from product sales and testing revenues 
our experience has been that sales to particular customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal   and  sales of equipment and services to our two largest customers accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues 
our ability to maintain close  satisfactory relationships with our customers is essential to our stability and growth 
the loss of or reduction or delay in orders from our significant customers  or delays in collecting accounts receivable from our significant customers  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there is a limited market for our testing products and services if testing equipment is purchased by semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers  it may reduce the likelihood that they will make further purchases of such equipment  or use our laboratories for testing services 
although military or other specifications require certain testing to be done by independent laboratories  over time other current customers may have less need for our testing services 
we believe that there is a growing trend toward outsourcing of the integrated circuit test process 
as a result  we anticipate continued growth in the test laboratory business 
however  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
in an attempt to diversify our sales mix  we may seek to develop and introduce new or advanced products  and to acquire other companies in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing business 
acquisition and integration of new businesses could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our business a portion of any future growth may be accomplished through the acquisition of other entities 
the success of those acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the acquired personnel  operations  products  services and technologies into our 
table of contents organization  to retain and motivate key personnel of the acquired entities and to retain the customers of those entities 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  obtain financing on acceptable terms to bring the acquisition to fruition or to integrate such personnel  operations  products or services 
the process of identifying and closing acquisition opportunities and integrating acquisitions into our operations may distract our management and employees  disrupt our ongoing business  increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our operations 
we may also be subject to certain other risks if we acquire other entities  such as the assumption of additional liabilities 
we may issue additional equity securities or incur debt to pay for future acquisitions 
we do not have contracts with key suppliers we have no written contracts with any of our suppliers 
our suppliers may terminate their relationships with us at any time without notice 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to find satisfactory replacement suppliers or that new suppliers would not be more expensive than the current suppliers if any of our suppliers were to terminate their relationship with us 
we are highly dependent on key personnel our success has depended  and  to a large extent will depend  on the continued services of sw yong  our chief executive officer and president  victor h 
m 
ting  our vice president and chief financial officer  our other key senior executives and engineering  marketing  sales  productions and other personnel 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
yong or mr 
ting  but we are the beneficiary of key man life insurance in the amount of million on mr 
yong and million on mr 
ting 
the loss of these key personnel  who would be difficult to replace  could harm our business and operating results 
competition for management in our industry is intense and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the executive management and other key personnel that we require 
our management has significant influence over corporate decisions currently our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock  including options held by them that are exercisable within days of the date of filing of this k 
as a result  they may be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval of the shareholders  including the election of directors  and may be able to delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
we have not paid cash dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we anticipate that the future earnings  if any  will be retained for use in the business or for other corporate purposes 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future 
additionally  california law prohibits the payment of dividends if the company does not have sufficient retained earnings or cannot meet certain asset to liability ratios 
thus  there is no assurance that the company would be permitted to pay dividends in the future 
possible dilutive effect of outstanding options as of june   there were  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options 
the outstanding options are currently exercisable at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
we anticipate that the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any such outstanding options will exceed the exercise price under those options 
thus such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our shareholders 
the market price for our common stock is subject to fluctuation the trading price of our common stock has from time to time fluctuated widely 
the trading price may similarly fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor industry and other events or factors 
in addition  in recent years  broad stock market indices in general  and the securities of technology companies in particular  have experienced substantial price fluctuations on a daily basis 
fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock may adversely affect our liquidity 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate and thus subject us to market risk due to those fluctuations 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not 
table of contents expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio  though no assurances can be given that material losses will not occur 
the outstanding aggregate principal balance on loans to us and on our lines of credit range from to per annum 
as of june   the outstanding principal balance on these loans was approximately  these interest rates are subject to change and we cannot predict an increase or decrease in rates  if any

although the majority of our sales  cost of manufacturing and marketing are transacted in us dollars  significant portions of our revenues are denominated in singapore and euro dollars  malaysian ringgit  thai baht and other currencies 
consequently  a portion of our costs  revenues and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and such foreign currencies 
we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates if there is a mismatch between our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal  an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal and an increase of to shareholders equity for fiscal we try to reduce our risk of foreign currency fluctuations by purchasing certain equipment and supplies in us dollars and seeking payment  when possible  in us dollars
