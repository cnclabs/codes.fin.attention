item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  compared to and compared to 
competition the company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation  extensive research efforts and significant competition 
in general  the theraseed and i seed devices compete with conventional methods of treating localized cancer  including  but not limited to  radical prostatectomy rp and external beam radiation therapy ebrt which includes intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt  as well as competing permanent devices 
rp currently represents the most common medical treatment for early stage  localized prostate cancer 
ebrt is also a well established method of treatment and is widely accepted for patients who represent a poor surgical risk or whose prostate cancer has advanced beyond the stage for which surgical treatment is indicated 
management believes that if general conversion from these treatment options or other established or conventional procedures to theraseed treatment does occur  such conversion will likely be the result of a combination of equivalent or better efficacy  reduced incidence of side effects and complications  lower cost  other quality of life issues and pressure by health care providers and patients 
several companies have obtained regulatory approval to produce and distribute palladium and iodine seeds  which compete directly with the theraseed and i seed devices 
management believes that theragenics has competitive advantages over these companies including  but not limited to i its proprietary production processes that have been developed and patented  ii its record of reliability and safety in its manufacturing operations  iii the time and resources required for competitors production capabilities to ramp up to commercial production on a scale comparable to theragenics  iv outsourcing of the company s cancer information center to healthcare specialist  telerx  a subsidiary of merck pharmaceutical and v its direct sales force  as well as the non exclusive distribution agreements that the company currently has in place  which allow it to leverage multiple distribution channels and access multiple marketing approaches and philosophies 
at any point in time  management of theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for the theraseed device in order to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on the prices of the theraseed device and or could have a favorable effect on market share and volumes  while failure to do so could adversely affect market share and volumes although per unit pricing could possibly be maintained 
in addition to the competition from the procedures and companies noted above  many companies  both public and private  are researching new and innovative methods of preventing and treating cancer 
in addition  many companies  including many large  well known pharmaceutical  medical device and chemical companies that have significant resources available to them  are engaged in radiological pharmaceutical and device research 
these companies are located in the united states  europe and throughout the world 
significant developments by any of these companies could have a material adverse effect on the demand for theragenics products 
government regulation the company s present and future intended activities in the development  manufacture and sale of cancer therapy products are subject to extensive laws  regulations  regulatory approvals and guidelines 
within the united states  the company s therapeutic radiological devices must comply with the us federal food  drug and cosmetic act  which is enforced by the fda

the company is also required to adhere to applicable fda regulations for good manufacturing practices  including extensive record keeping and periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities 
the company obtained fda k clearance in to market the theraseed device for  in general  the treatment of localized solid tumors 
a new k clearance would be required for any modifications in the device or its labeling that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the original product 
the company s handling of radioactive materials is governed by the state of georgia in agreement with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
the users of the theraseed device are also required to possess licenses issued either by the states in which they reside or the nrc depending upon the state involved and the production process used 
the company s expansion plans required the company to secure additional permits and licenses from a number of environmental  health and safety regulatory agencies 
to date  the company has not experienced delays in licensing any of its facilities or cyclotrons 
the company is required under its radioactive materials license to maintain radiation control and radiation safety personnel  procedures  equipment and processes  and to monitor its facilities and its employees and contractors 
the company is also required to provide financial assurance that adequate funding will exist for end of life radiological decommissioning of its cyclotrons and other radioactive areas of its property that contain radioactive materials 
the company s decommissioning obligations will increase as its production capacity is expanded 
the company is also subject to federal  state and local regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment generally 
during  the company became aware of the need for an industrial process water permit from the city of buford  georgia 
the company has taken all the required steps to obtain this permit and expects to obtain the permit during the company disposes low level radioactive waste to licensed commercial radioactive waste treatment or disposal facilities for incineration or land disposal 
the company provides training and monitoring of its personnel to facilitate the proper handling of all materials

on may  a stockholder of the company filed a derivative complaint in the delaware court of chancery purportedly on behalf of the company  alleging that certain directors breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in the conduct that is alleged in the consolidated federal class action complaint 
the derivative action has been stayed by the agreement of the parties 
on july   the court granted the company s motion to dismiss the consolidated federal class action complaint for failure to state a claim against the company  and granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint 
on august   the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint and on march   the court denied the defendant s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs second amended complaint 
the court also denied the company s motion for reconsideration 
subsequently  the court certified the class and the parties commenced discovery 
discovery in the case is now complete 
the company filed a motion for summary judgment on september  in which it asks the court to find that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact in the case  and therefore  the case must be dismissed 
the plaintiffs have filed a brief in opposition  and the motion is currently pending before the court 
management continues to believe that these charges are without merit and is opposing the litigation vigorously  however  given the nature and stage of the proceedings  the ultimate outcome of the litigation cannot be determined at this time 
accordingly  no provision for any liability that might result from this litigation has been made 
the company maintains insurance for claims of this general nature 
from time to time the company may be a party to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business  none of which  in the view of management  is expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company

theragenics is the world s largest producer of palladium  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for its theraseed device 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed device 
the theraseed device has also been approved for marketing throughout the member countries of the european union by obtaining its ce mark 
sales of the theraseed device in europe have not been significant 
the majority of sales are channeled through third party distributors 
the company also sells its theraseed devices directly to physicians 
early in the company diversified its product line with the purchase of the us iodine prostate brachytherapy business of bebig isotopen und medizintechnik gmbh bebig  formerly distributed by isotope products laboratories both subsidiaries of a publicly traded german company  eckert ziegler ag 
the purchase gives theragenics exclusive us manufacturing and distribution rights to an fda cleared iodine based medical device for the treatment of prostate cancer 
theragenics began distribution of the iodine based medical device early in  and subsequently began to produce i seed the theragenics iodine based medical device early in  utilizing the automated production equipment procured in the business acquisition 
the company sells the i seed device directly to physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers 
the non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device have no distribution rights for the i seed device 
non exclusive rights to distribute the theraseed device in europe were granted to bebig as part of the transaction 
the company believes that the ability to provide both theraseed and i seed devices will enhance the company s ability to market to direct customers who seek a single source for both palladium and iodine brachytherapy seeds 
the product line and equipment purchase will not affect the company s existing non exclusive distribution agreements for the theraseed device 
the company constructed a facility in the oak ridge  tennessee area initially intended to expand the company s production capacity for palladium  using unique plasma separation process psp technology being leased from the us department of energy doe 
psp technology is a method of separating relatively large quantities of specific non radioactive isotopes from specific elements 
in connection with the company s ongoing program targeted at diversifying its future revenue stream  the company continues to explore new applications for psp technology 
among other things  the psp technology enables the company to conduct feasibility runs designed to validate isotope usage in various diverse markets and industries 
in july theragenics agreed to produce test quantities of certain gadolinium isotopes for purchase by an international nuclear services company using the psp technology 
the gadolinium for the international nuclear services company was intended for a non medical application and was delivered during the second quarter of the revenue  recognized in the second quarter of  was immaterial to total revenue and represents the end of work under this agreement 
further  in the company performed feasibility runs to validate the psp s capabilities to produce specific isotopes of certain elements in the rare earth group of elements for ut battelle  llc battelle  a partnership between the university of tennessee and battelle  which manages the oak ridge national laboratory for the us department of energy 
these agreements  which are now completed  did not have a material impact on revenue or earnings 
in addition to feasibility runs and isotope production  the psp is capable of supplying palladium raw material 
psp operations are underway to enrich palladium with the psp to ensure ample supply of material 
the company s palladium material can be used either to support seed production or the company s ongoing research and development r d initiatives 
the company s diversification program includes the clinical trial that utilizes a palladium device  called the therasource intravascular brachytherapy system  designed to prevent restenosis or renarrowing of arteries following treatment of peripheral vascular disease by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
following the approval of the investigational device exemption granted by the u 
s 
food and drug administration fda in august to initiate the therap clinical trial  theragenics began a clinical trial using a palladium device patent pending early in the trial was initiated at the fuqua heart center at piedmont hospital and st 
joseph s hospital  both in atlanta 
two additional centers  northeast georgia medical center in gainesville  georgia and brigham women s hospital in boston  massachusetts  signed on and opened enrollment in the trial in the fourth quarter of to date  patients have been treated 
information and data gathered from the study will enable the company to determine the safety  feasibility and marketing capabilities of the device 
preliminary indications from the study are encouraging  although the study is ongoing and conclusions cannot yet be reached 
the company will continue to refine the device to go into areas of the vasculature that may provide the most attractive market opportunities for the company 
additionally  an animal pilot study using palladium in a prototype device designed for the treatment of age related macular degeneration amd  a disease that leads to loss of eyesight and in some cases complete blindness  was completed early in progress has been made in the development of a marketable device for the treatment of amd 
a patent is pending for the therasight device and the company is analyzing various differing trial designs  while mindful of the emerging potential competition in this market 
plans continue toward commencement of a human clinical safety trial of the therasight device possibly in the increases in research and development expenditures may continue as these initiatives are pursued 
the company has also identified potential opportunities  utilizing its cyclotrons  for production of radiochemical products  which are typically used in medical nuclear imaging procedures 
although this opportunity is in an early stage  the company may devote additional resources to this project in with a view to developing future new products  although they could  if pursued  increase research and development expenses 
however  any such radiochemical product sale is not expected to have a material impact on revenue in the company is also searching for  reviewing and evaluating external opportunities for diversification in the form of joint ventures  partnerships  and or acquisitions of technologies  products and companies 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of the theraseed device 
theraseed sales direct to customers and to third party distributors remained comparable as a percentage of total theraseed sales in and although the average selling price of theraseed remained steady in when compared to  the overall decrease in revenues is the direct result of the decrease in total unit sales  both direct and to third party distributors 
currently  the company has non exclusive distribution agreements in place with two companies for the distribution of the theraseed device  a reduction from the four distributors in place at the beginning of during  one of the non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device acquired two of the other three non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device 
sales to this acquiring distributor  combined with sales to the distributors it acquired  decreased approximately in as compared to the company believes that the decrease in unit sales throughout the year was a combination of several factors including disappointing sales by the company s non exclusive distribution partners  consolidation and ownership changes in the brachytherapy market  continued deep discounting in the market by many competitors  including iodine seeds throughout the year and palladium seeds in the latter part of the year  and uncertainty related to changing rules for medicare reimbursement see medicare developments below 
the company diversified its product line in with the introduction of i seed  an iodine based brachytherapy device see overview above 
the company believes the ability to provide both devices  ie  theraseed and i seed  will allow access to direct customers otherwise not available 
i seed sales represented approximately of total brachytherapy product sales during the non exclusive distributors of the theraseed device have no distribution rights for the i seed device 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments received for the company s therasphere technology 
such licensing fees are not expected to become material in the foreseeable future 
at any point in time  theragenics and or its non exclusive distributors may change their respective pricing policies for the theraseed device in order to take advantage of market opportunities or to respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on the prices of the theraseed device and could have a favorable effect or prevent an unfavorable effect on market share and volumes 
failure to respond to market opportunities and competitive situations in order to maintain per unit pricing could adversely affect current or potential market share and volumes and or result in a decrease in margins 
cost of sales was million during compared to million in gross profit was approximately of revenue in  compared to in the decrease in gross profit percentage in compared to was largely due to the considerable fixed cost component of theragenics operations  partially offset by the transfer of material and resources to support research and development initiatives and the completion of depreciation  early in  of the first cyclotron placed in service 
approximately million of operating expenses related to the psp facility  including approximately million of depreciation  were recognized in cost of sales during compared to million during the second half of in addition  as a result of the purchase of the us iodine prostate brachytherapy business of bebig early in see overview above  approximately  of operating expenses were included in cost of sales during for direct costs related to the i seed device 
the i seed production line at the company s buford facility became operational early in as a result  depreciation and costs incurred to support this production line will be included in cost of sales during selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in  compared to  was due primarily to an increase in headcount and expenses associated with the direct sales force as a result of hiring brachytherapy specialists to promote the theraseed brand 
sg a expenses were also higher during as a result of outsourcing the company s cancer information center to healthcare specialist  telerx  a subsidiary of merck pharmaceutical  and a significant increase in directors and officers liability insurance premiums 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the start up expenses related to the psp facility  which became operational in the second half of see overview above and liquidity and capital resources below 
r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue in  from million  or of revenue in the increase in r d expenses in was a result of the company s diversification initiatives geared to expand the application of palladium to other oncological and non oncological uses  and to explore options for using the company s expertise and capabilities in other areas 
the bulk of these expenses were associated with the company s peripheral vascular and macular degeneration programs see overview above 
other income  primarily comprising interest income  was  in compared to  in the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
funds available for investment have been and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and r d activities  and may be used for the acquisition of technologies  products or companies consistent with the goals of theragenics 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects other income to fluctuate accordingly 
the company s effective income tax rate was a benefit of in  primarily due to permanent differences related to tax exempt interest income on municipal and government securities  compared to an expense of in the company s income tax rate in each period differed from statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects  research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
during  unit sales of the theraseed device decreased approximately  while unit sales directly to customers decreased to of total unit sales in from approximately in the average selling price of the theraseed device decreased from to  which contributed to the overall decrease in revenues because direct to consumer sales are made at higher prices than sales to third party distributors 
the company believes that the decrease in unit sales throughout the year was a combination of several factors including disappointing sales by the company s non exclusive distribution partners and uncertainty related to changing rules for medicare reimbursement see medicare developments below 
the change in the distribution mix  which led to a decrease in the average selling price  was a result of several factors beginning with the termination of the distribution agreement with indigo medical inc indigo  a johnson and johnson company  in january after the termination of the agreement  theragenics increased its number of direct sales and began sales through other non exclusive distributors 
however  theragenics sold to a significant number of former indigo customers while publicly stating that it expected its share of direct theraseed device sales to decline as its other non exclusive distributors began to market aggressively to the former indigo customers 
the percentage of direct to customer sales for theragenics declined from as the non exclusive distributors began aggressively marketing to former indigo customers 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments received for the company s therasphere technology 
cost of sales was million during compared to million in gross profit was of revenue in  compared to in the decrease in gross profit percentage in compared to was largely due to the considerable fixed cost component of theragenics operations  partially offset by the transfer of material and resources to support research and development initiatives 
in addition  the psp facility commenced operations in the second half of and the related operating expenses were included in cost of sales  including approximately  of depreciation 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in general advertising of approximately million in compared to additionally  theragenics incurred higher expenses from increased premiums related to insurance coverage  primarily for directors and officers liability insurance when policies were renewed late in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in consulting costs compared to r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue in  from million  or of revenue in the company s research and development initiatives are intended to expand the application of palladium to other oncological and non oncological uses  and to explore options for using the company s expertise and capabilities in other areas 
the company s r d initiatives during and were related primarily to peripheral vascular and age related macular degeneration programs 
during theragenics was granted an investigational device exemption from the us food and drug administration to initiate its therap therasource palladium for the prevention of restenosis clinical trial 
other income  primarily comprising interest income  was  in compared to million in the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
while additional funds were available for investment during  the interest rate environment during reduced the effective returns on a significant portion of the company s investments 
funds available for investment have been and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and r d activities  and may be used for the acquisition of technologies  products or companies consistent with the goals of theragenics 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects other income to fluctuate accordingly 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately for both and the company s income tax rate in each period was lower than statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects  research activities  and tax exempt interest income 
critical accounting policies the financial statements of theragenics corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following property  plant  equipment and goodwill 
property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
the company s estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
the company currently owns and operates cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in each of the company s cyclotrons is depreciated using an estimated year life 
management s estimate of the useful life of these cyclotrons is based on the company s experience to date with these cyclotrons 
based on experience gained relative to the operation  refurbishment  and maintenance of the cyclotrons  management believes there is a substantive basis for the current depreciable lives of the cyclotrons 
although the older cyclotrons require increased maintenance  all the cyclotrons remain in service  including fully depreciated cyclotrons because the material produced by each machine is required for ongoing operations and the company s current research and development initiatives 
the psp equipment was placed in service during the second half of and is depreciated using an estimated year life 
the psp equipment utilizes specialized  unique technology 
early in the company entered into an agreement to purchase the brachytherapy business of bebig isotopen und medizintechnik gmbh bebig  a subsidiary company of eckert ziegler ag 
a total of approximately million in progress payments and professional fees had been paid through december  an additional payment in the amount of million was made subsequent to year end the payments made through december  were allocated between the market value of the assets in the amount of million and million to goodwill 
the equipment became operational in the company has determined that the production line will be amortized over a fifteen year life 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually evaluated for impairment 
the company will review the recoverability of the carrying value of identified intangibles and other long lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecast of discounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  utilizing our best estimates  appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
these projected future cash flows may vary significantly over time as a result of increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are being amortized and this amortization is included in the accompanying statements of operations 
management will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness 
if the company should determine that the useful life of property  plant or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful life lives of the identified asset s 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivable balances may become uncollectable 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  management analyzes accounts receivable in relation to current economic trends and changes in our customer payment history in establishing this allowance 
approximately  was recognized as uncollectable in the accounts receivable balance  net of the provision for trade accounts receivables allowance of  was approximately million as of december  commitments and other contractual obligations operating leases the principle commitments of the company include land leases  rental space and office equipment under operating  non cancelable leases that expire at various dates through april  and asset purchase obligations 
approximate minimum payments of these obligations are as follows obligation payments due by period total thereafter land lease      equipment and automobile     purchase obligations   total       land lease payments are subject to adjustments for increases in the consumer price index  january  and every five years thereafter 
the company had one remaining payment obligation of million in connection with the iodine based product line purchase from bebig at december  all payment obligations in connection with the business acquisition were completed after year end 
in december the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with a contractor for the design and manufacture of certain equipment 
the capital asset purchase agreement in the amount of million is expected to be completed in late at year end  progress payments in the amount of approximately  had been paid in relation to the purchase agreement 
guarantees under letters of credit the company has issued standby letters of credit from time to time as security for certain liabilities 
at december   total outstanding letters of credit  under the credit agreement  approximated  these letters of credit are related to asset retirement liabilities of long lived assets  as well as a utility deposit to the city of oak ridge 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  short term investments and marketable securities of million at december   compared to million at december  marketable securities consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policy 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  the company also has a credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for revolving borrowings of up to million  including a million sub limit for letters of credit  through a credit facility with a three year term 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  letters of credit totaling  were outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  these letters of credit represent decommission funding required by the georgia department of natural resources and a utility deposit to the city of oak ridge  tennessee in connection with the psp facility 
cash generated by operations was million and million in and  respectively 
cash generated from operations consists of net earnings loss plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  deferred income tax expense and changes in balance sheet items such as accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and payables 
the decrease in cash generated by operations during is due primarily to the net loss of  during compared to net income of million during depreciation and amortization increased to approximately million in from million in  largely due to the depreciation of the building and equipment placed in service at the oak ridge facility during the latter half of the increase in depreciation and amortization contributed by the oak ridge facility and equipment was partially offset by the completion of the depreciable life of one cyclotron mid way through the first quarter of inventories increased approximately  during primarily due to a purchase of palladium metal at a cost of approximately  to support ongoing and future r d initiatives see overview and results of operations above 
the raw material  purchased from a us mining company  is being processed using psp technology housed in the oak ridge facility 
inventory also increased in as raw material  components and shipping supplies inventory increased to accommodate the i seed product line 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased as payments representing repairs and spare parts for cyclotrons and equipment increased in compared to the same period in cash used in investing activities totaled million and million during and  respectively 
this spending related primarily to purchases of marketable securities according to the company s investment policy 
also  the company s purchase of the us iodine prostate brachytherapy business of bebig see overview above contributed to capital spending in the company procured an automated production line as part of the agreement that became operational early in all progress payments  representing completion of pre defined milestones  have been made to bebig 
a total of approximately million in progress payments and capitalized professional fees were paid through december  the progress payments were allocated to the fair value of the product line and goodwill in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively 
the additional progress payment in the amount of million  paid in  will be recognized as goodwill 
the company expects that r d spending will continue at the current level or will increase see results of operations  above 
routine capital expenditures and the purchase of the equipment and facility renovations related to the iodine line  totaled approximately million during cash was also used in for increased marketing and theraseed support activities see results of operations above  and in the pursuit of diversification efforts  including  but not limited to  ongoing work in peripheral vascular and macular degeneration programs

during the fourth quarter of  the company executed a credit agreement with a financial institution 
the credit agreement  which expires october  subject to earlier termination by the lender upon the occurrence of certain events of default  provides for revolving borrowings of up to million at any time outstanding  including a million sub limit for letters of credit 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable at the rate of interest periodically designated by the financial institution as its base rate  or  at the option of the company  interest may accrue at a libor based rate  plus an applicable margin which is subject to quarterly adjustment 
interest on base rate loans is payable monthly  while interest on libor loans is payable on the last day of the applicable one  two or three month interest period 
as of december  no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement 
we have issued standby letters of credit from time to time as security for certain liabilities 
at december   total outstanding letters of credit  under the credit agreement  approximated  these letters of credit are related to asset retirement liabilities of long lived assets  as well as a utility deposit to the city of oak ridge 
the credit agreement is unsecured  but provides for a springing lien to be established on substantially all of the assets of the company subject to certain exceptions in the event certain events of default occur under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  as well as affirmative  reporting and negative covenants  customary for financings of this type 
among other things  certain provisions of the credit agreement limit the incurrence of additional debt and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
the credit agreement replaced the august unsecured credit agreement with the company s previous lender  which would have expired on october  the prior unsecured credit agreement provided for a million revolving loan and letter of credit commitment  and an additional uncommitted million line of credit 
medicare developments previously  theragenics theraseed device and other brachytherapy seeds fell within various transitional pass through codes  which were separate from the procedure payment codes that comprise much of medicare s outpatient prospective payment system opps 
on april   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms implemented changes in hospital payments for brachytherapy and other services provided under medicare s opps for the remainder of through december   cms bundled a portion of pass through reimbursement for all brachytherapy seeds and other devices with the associated procedure codes  thereby effectively sheltering seeds from pro rata reductions that would otherwise have applied under medicare law 
to the extent that these pass through device costs exceeded the bundled amount  the remaining cost was subject to a pro rated reduction in reimbursement 
during  cms further revised its policies by bundling the costs of the prostate brachytherapy procedure  as well as the costs for catheters  needles and all seeds  into two new codes for prostate brachytherapy one for palladium and one for iodine 
by creating two codes and setting separate reimbursement amounts for palladium seed brachytherapy including the theraseed device and iodine seed brachytherapy including the i seed device  cms made an important  positive change in its final rule for compared to its initial proposal published on august  specifically  the per patient reimbursement amount under the final rule for palladium prostate brachytherapy exceeded the original payment amount proposed in august for both palladium and iodine the final per patient amount for palladium prostate brachytherapy also exceeded the payment amount for iodine prostate brachytherapy 
to the extent that the brachytherapy costs for an individual patient exceeded the bundled payment amount during  the remaining costs could not be submitted for additional reimbursement 
on december   the president signed new medicare legislation into law that provides for improved reimbursement and coding policies in and beyond for brachytherapy seeds sources under medicare s opps 
to reflect the changes in the statute  cms revised its november  final rule by publishing a new interim final rule for on january  the brachytherapy provisions in the new legislation  which went into effect on january   require medicare to unbundle the cost of the seeds from the costs of the brachytherapy procedure  catheters and needles under the opps 
more specifically  the new legislation requires medicare to reimburse hospitals for each brachytherapy seed source furnished between january  to december  based on the hospital s costs for each patient calculated from the hospital s charges adjusted by the hospital s specific cost to charge ratio 
this means that hospital reimbursement is no longer limited to or dictated by the reimbursement amounts assigned to the brachytherapy codes  which cms used in with respect to coding  the legislation requires the medicare program to create and use coding that classifies brachytherapy seeds sources separately from all the other services and items reimbursed under the opps 
these separate codes for brachytherapy seeds sources must be used in a manner that reflects the type of radioactive isotope for example  palladium  the radioactive intensity and the number of brachytherapy seeds sources used to treat each patient 
depending on the number of seeds needed to treat each prostate patient  the total reimbursement for the combination of the unbundled procedure codes and seeds for the payment methodology in place until at least december  may be higher than the bundled payment amounts 
the legislation enacted in also directs the us general accounting office gao to conduct a study examining future payment policies for brachytherapy seeds 
the company believes its efforts in assisting policymakers in formulating and revising medicare policies to recognize the unique aspects of classification and reimbursement that apply to brachytherapy devices such as theraseed were pivotal to the enactment of this new  improved medicare legislation for brachytherapy seeds sources 
the company plans to continue working to assist policymakers regarding these important issues in the future 
the company believes that the significant number of proposed and actual changes in medicare coding and reimbursement policy in the years preceding and during  created confusion for hospitals and doctors  which may have had a detrimental impact on sales in see results of operations above 
in addition  due to the fact that the medicare rules governing coding of brachytherapy seeds sources have undergone significant change during the past few years  the company believes that medicare reimbursement may continue to create confusion for hospitals and doctors going forward 
in that regard  management continues to closely monitor any effects of the reimbursement structure on the brachytherapy market as it continues to evaluate pricing  marketing and distribution strategies 
the company continues to engage a consulting firm specializing in reimbursement practices to help communicate brachytherapy reimbursement guidelines to customers
