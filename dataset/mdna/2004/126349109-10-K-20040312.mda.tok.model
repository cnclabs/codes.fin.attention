management overview the company 
we are a global leader in next generation billing and customer care solutions for the cable television  direct broadcast satellite  advanced ip services  next generation mobile  and fixed wireline markets 
our combination of proven and future ready solutions  delivered in both outsourced and licensed formats  enables our clients to deliver high quality customer service  improve operational efficiencies and rapidly bring new revenue generating products to market 
we are a s p midcap company 
we serve our clients through two operating segments the broadband services division the broadband division and the global software services division the gss division 
see the business section of this document for a full description of our operating segments and the markets they serve 
total revenues for our company decreased from million in to million in general market conditions 
the economic state of the global telecommunications industry continues to be depressed 
many telecommunications companies have reduced their operating costs and capital expenditures to cope with the depressed economic state of the industry 
since our clients operate within this industry sector  the economic state of this industry has directly impacted our business  limiting the amount of products and services clients purchase from us  as well as increasing the likelihood of uncollectible accounts receivable and lengthening the cash collection cycle 
broadband division 
the broadband division generates its revenues by providing customer care and billing services on a service bureau basis with its core product  csg ccs bp ccs  to north american primarily the us broadband service providers  primarily for cable television  internet  and satellite television product offerings 
the market for the broadband division s products and services is highly competitive  resulting in significant pricing pressures for contract renewals 
the north american broadband industry has experienced significant consolidation over the last few years  resulting in a large percentage of the market being served by a limited number of services providers 
consistent with this market concentration  a large percentage of our broadband division s revenues is generated from a limited number of clients 
the broadband division s and our company s three largest clients in order of size are comcast corporation comcast  echostar communications echostar  and time warner inc time warner 
a summary of the key business matters for the broadband division in were as follows 
these items are discussed in more detail throughout our md a 
revenues for the broadband division decreased from million in to million in comcast is the broadband division s  and our company s  largest client 
we have been in various legal proceedings with comcast since  consisting principally of arbitration proceedings related to our 
table of contents year exclusive contract for processing services the master subscriber agreement 
in october  the arbitrator issued his final ruling on this matter 
the arbitration ruling included an award of million to be paid by us to comcast 
the award was based on the arbitrator s determination that we had violated the most favored nations mfn clause of the master subscriber agreement 
we recorded a charge to revenue for this amount in the third quarter of in addition  the arbitrator ruled that comcast was entitled to be invoiced for lower fees under the mfn clause of the master subscriber agreement beginning october as a result  revenues from comcast when compared to amounts prior to the arbitration ruling are expected to decrease by approximately million annually 
on a positive note  the arbitrator did rule that we had not breached the master subscriber agreement  and that certain key provisions of the agreement remain in force  including our exclusive right to process the million video and high speed data accounts that comcast acquired from at t broadband in  and the year term of the agreement 
however  the arbitrator also ruled that if comcast unilaterally terminates the master subscriber agreement  it shall be liable to us under a contractual provision relating to consequential damages  for contract damages in the amount of million 
in the event of such termination  we would be required to provide comcast with termination assistance for seven months 
during  we were able to consolidate multiple contracts with various operating units of time warner into one consolidated agreement that runs through this solidified our business relationship with time warner 
the broadband division is currently involved in a significant architectural upgrade to ccs 
this enhancement to ccs will allow us to further support convergent broadband services including cross service bundling  convergent order entry and advanced service provisioning capabilities 
see the business section of this document for additional discussion of this matter 
our contract with our second largest client  echostar  was scheduled to expire december  in the first quarter of  this contract was extended through march  gss division 
the gss division was established as a result of our acquisition of the kenan business from lucent technologies lucent in february the gss division is a global provider of convergent billing and customer care software and services that enables telecommunications service providers to bill their customers for existing and next generation services  including mobile  internet  wireline  cable television  and satellite 
the gss division s revenues consist of software license and maintenance fees  and various professional and consulting services related to its software products principally  implementation services 
the market for the gss division s products and services is highly competitive  resulting in significant pricing pressures for both new and existing client purchases 
for  approximately of the gss division s revenues were generated outside the us  as compared to for a summary of the key business matters for the gss division for were as follows 
these items are discussed in more detail throughout our md a 
revenues for the gss division decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to the poor economic market conditions and the project difficulties and delays we experienced within our professional services organization 
although we began to see some signs of improvement in the market conditions in the latter part of through our recent contract wins  a sustained economic recovery of the global telecommunications industry could take several years 
key drivers of the value of the acquired kenan business  and other recent acquisitions  are the global telecommunications industry customer base and the software assets acquired 
in connection with these acquisitions  the gss division has approximately million of goodwill  and as of december  
table of contents  has other long lived intangible assets client contracts and software with a net carrying value of approximately million 
in light of the current market conditions  during the second quarter of we evaluated the carrying value of the gss division s goodwill and related long lived intangible assets and concluded that the carrying value of these assets had not been impaired 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our impairment analysis of these assets 
as part of the kenan business acquisition from lucent in  we assumed the obligation to complete a large systems implementation project in europe 
we experienced significant difficulties and delays in completing this project  and in the first quarter of  we announced that we expected an overall loss of approximately million on the project 
during the fourth quarter of  the client went live on the system 
although this phase of the project was successfully completed  our results of operations in particular  our professional services revenues and related gross margin were negatively impacted by the project 
towards the end of  and carrying into the first half of  we experienced difficulties in collecting accounts receivable from certain clients within the gss division  in particular  two clients in india 
the collection problems were the result of various administrative and client specific business matters 
as a result  our accounts receivable balance and days billing outstanding dbo were negatively impacted during this time frame 
during the last two quarters of  we resolved many of the administrative and client matters  and saw a significant improvement in our accounts receivable balance and dbo 
we combined the best of the traditional csg software solutions with the best of the kenan business software solutions and introduced kenan fx in late kenan fx is the result of an month r d project that resulted in a business framework consisting of pre integrated products and modules that make services available via a common middle layer 
see the business section of this document for additional discussion of this matter 
other key events 
other key business matters for were as follows 
these items are discussed in more detail throughout our md a 
during and  we implemented several cost reduction initiatives in response to the lingering poor economic conditions within the global telecommunications industry  and as a result of the expected reduction in revenues resulting from the comcast arbitration ruling 
these cost reduction programs consisted primarily of involuntary employee terminations  reductions in various employee compensation matters  and facilities abandonments 
these cost reduction initiatives resulted in restructuring charges in both and see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our restructuring activities in and the million comcast arbitration award payment negatively impacted our liquidity in the fourth quarter of  and would have resulted in a default of our bank credit agreement as of december  if not modified by that date 
in the fourth quarter of  we favorably amended our bank credit agreement and we were in compliance with both the financial and non financial covenants of the agreement as of december  we expect to remain in compliance going forward 
as part of the amendment  we agreed to an increase in the interest rate spread 
we also agreed to a number of other modifications to the credit agreement  including a mandatory payment of million in july  a reduction in our revolving credit facility to million and additional limitations on certain investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our credit agreement and the related amendment to this agreement during the fourth quarter of  we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based awards in accordance with sfas no 
 using the prospective method of transition as outlined in sfas no 
the adoption of this accounting standard was effective as of january  total stock based compensation for was million  with million attributed to the adoption of this accounting standard 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the quarterly impact of adopting sfas no 

table of contents the majority of our employees previously issued stock options had exercise prices significantly above the current market price of our stock  providing little  if any  retention value 
in order to provide a financial incentive for our employees to help us execute on our business plan and continue to provide high quality products and services to the telecommunications industry  we offered employees the ability to voluntarily exchange certain stock options for restricted stock 
on december   we successfully completed this exchange program 
we accepted for exchange and cancelled outstanding options to purchase million shares of our common stock 
in exchange for such cancelled options  we granted million shares of restricted stock  which will vest ratably over a three year period 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this exchange program 
comcast and at t broadband business relationship background 
in  we entered into the master subscriber agreement with tele communications  inc tci to consolidate all tci customers onto our customer care and billing system 
in and  respectively  at t completed its mergers with tci and mediaone group  inc mediaone  and consolidated the merged operations into at t broadband at t  and we continued to service the merged operations under the terms of the master subscriber agreement 
on november   comcast completed its merger with at t  and now under comcast s ownership  we continue to service the former at t operations under the terms of the master subscriber agreement  as modified by the arbitration ruling described below 
unless specifically identified differently  references to comcast hereafter in this document include at t and its predecessor companies referenced above 
arbitration ruling 
we have been involved in various legal proceedings with comcast since  consisting principally of arbitration proceedings related to the master subscriber agreement 
in october  we received the final ruling in the arbitration proceedings 
a summary of the arbitration ruling is as follows comcast does not have the right to terminate the master subscriber agreement between the two companies under the termination provisions of the contract  we maintain the exclusive rights to process the at t video and high speed data customers acquired by comcast  we did not obtain the right to process the additional comcast customers  comcast is not entitled  pursuant to an amendment to the master subscriber agreement  to deconvert customers from our system  comcast is entitled to relief under the mfn clause of the master subscriber agreement and  going forward  comcast is entitled to receive charges and fees based on our agreements with other clients  comcast also was awarded mfn damages for the periods through september  of million  if comcast unilaterally terminates the master subscriber agreement  it shall be liable to us under a contractual provision relating to consequential damages  for contract damages in the amount of million 
in the event of such termination  we would be required to provide comcast with termination assistance for seven months 
arbitration award 
as stated above  the arbitration ruling included an award of million to be paid by us to comcast 
the award was based on the arbitrator s determination that we had violated the mfn clause of the master subscriber agreement 
we recorded the impact from the arbitration ruling in the quarter ended september  as a charge to the broadband division s revenue 
as specified in the arbitration ruling  the million was segregated such that million was attributable to periods prior to july   and million was attributable to the third quarter of although the arbitration ruling did not segregate the 
table of contents award by revenue type  we estimated that million of the million attributable to the third quarter of could be further attributed to processing revenues  and the remaining million could be attributed to software maintenance fees 
these amounts have been netted against the respective third quarter gross revenues ie  revenues prior to the arbitration award in our consolidated statements of operations and our segment results in note to our consolidated financial statements 
upon receipt of the arbitration ruling on october   we sought a modification to the award  believing the arbitrator had miscalculated the total amount of mfn damages 
on october   we paid approximately million of the arbitration award to comcast  using available corporate funds 
the million payment represented the portion of the arbitration award that we did not contest 
on october   the arbitrator ruled that he did not miscalculate the mfn damages and that we must pay the remaining arbitration award of approximately million to comcast 
on november   the parties amended the master subscriber agreement  which included payment terms for this amount 
as a result of this amendment  we paid approximately million in november  and the remaining million was paid in january the amount of the award accrued interest at eight percent per annum from october  until paid  which resulted in approximately million of interest expense being recorded in the fourth quarter of our insurance policies did not provide any relief towards the arbitration award 
we expect to receive an income tax benefit of approximately million based on an estimated income tax rate of approximately for the million arbitration award paid to comcast through a reduction of income taxes otherwise payable and through our ability to carry back net operating losses to previous years 
impact of mfn adjustment on current and future periods 
as stated above  the arbitrator ruled that comcast is entitled to be invoiced for lower fees under the mfn clause of the master subscriber agreement beginning october as a result  future quarterly revenues when compared to amounts prior to the arbitration ruling from comcast are expected to decrease by approximately million  or million annually 
gross revenues ie  revenues prior to the arbitration award generated from comcast for the third quarter of were approximately of our total gross revenues  which is a percentage comparable to those in our more recent quarters 
total revenues generated from comcast in the third quarter after considering the impact of the million arbitration award  but ignoring the impact of the million arbitration charge attributed to periods prior july  and the fourth quarter of were approximately of our total revenues 
we expect that the percentage of our total revenues for from comcast will represent a percentage comparable to that of the third and fourth quarters of ie  approximately 
as discussed in greater detail under restructuring charges below  in response to these lower revenues  we implemented a cost reduction program in the fourth quarter of that will lower our operating expenses in by approximately million  when compared to the third quarter operating expense run rate 
we have various long lived intangible assets client contracts related to the master subscriber agreement which have a net carrying value as of december  of approximately million 
we have evaluated the carrying value of these assets in light of the arbitration ruling  and have concluded that there has been no impairment to these assets as of december  we will continue to monitor the carrying value of these assets as we discuss with comcast possible modifications to the master subscriber agreement as a result of the arbitration ruling  as discussed in greater detail below 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our intangible assets 
contract rights and obligations 
the master subscriber agreement has an original term of years and expires in  and contains certain performance criteria and other obligations to be met by us 
comcast has the right to terminate the master subscriber agreement in the event of certain defaults by us 
as stated above  the arbitrator ruled that comcast currently does not have the right to terminate the master subscriber agreement under the termination provisions of the contract 
the master subscriber agreement and all subsequent amendments are included in our exhibits to our periodic public filings with the sec 
these documents are available on the internet and we encourage readers to review these documents for further details 

table of contents as stated above  the arbitrator ruled that we maintained the exclusive rights to process the at t video and high speed data customers acquired by comcast 
prior to the arbitration ruling  the annual minimum financial commitments due from comcast under the master subscriber agreement were approximately million 
the arbitrator ruled that the minimum payment provision in the agreement between the parties is subject to the mfn clause 
the effect of this ruling is that  while we maintain our exclusive right to process the comcast customers previously owned by at t  the minimum financial obligation under the agreement is reduced to reflect the charges and fees under a contract with another client 
however  as stated above  the arbitrator also ruled that if comcast unilaterally terminates the master subscriber agreement  it shall be liable to us under a contractual provision relating to consequential damages  for contract damages in the amount of million 
in the event of such termination  we would be required to provide comcast with termination assistance for seven months 
in accordance with the arbitrator s ruling  the november  amendment mentioned above specifies the fees and procedures associated with the seven months of termination assistance we would provide should either party terminate the contract  and also sets forth the manner in which comcast would be entitled to obtain its customer data in a deconversion format 
we expect to generate a significant percentage of our future revenues under the master subscriber agreement 
there are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with one client 
one such risk is that  should comcast terminate the master subscriber agreement in whole or in part for any of the reasons stated above  or significantly reduce the revenues expected to be generated under the master subscriber agreement  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations including possible impairment  or significant acceleration of the amortization of the intangible asset related to the master subscriber agreement mentioned above 
current discussions with comcast 
we are currently discussing possible modifications to the master subscriber agreement with comcast as a result of the arbitration ruling 
at this time  there can be no assurance that we will modify the master subscriber agreement or restructure our business relationship with comcast under a new contract  and even if so  there can be no assurance that the modified or new terms of the contract will provide the same or similar financial performance or other important terms to those contained in the existing master subscriber agreement 
while the substance of any discussions between comcast and us are not being made public at this time  readers are strongly encouraged to frequently review our filings with the sec as well as all public announcements from us related to this matter 
this is of particular importance as it is impossible to predict accurately at this time when any further information on this matter will be available 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to select appropriate accounting policies  and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the most critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the critical accounting policies were determined by considering our accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies identified relate to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  iii impairment assessments of long lived assets  iv business restructurings  v loss contingencies  vi income taxes  vii business combinations and asset purchases  viii stock based compensation  and ix capitalization of internal software development costs 
these critical accounting policies  as well as our other significant accounting policies  are disclosed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
in light of the current economic conditions  collectibility of fees is one of the key revenue recognition criteria for us for all revenue sources 
revenues are recognized only if we determine that the collection of the fees included in the arrangement is considered probable ie  we expect the client to pay all amounts in full when invoiced 
in making our determination of collectibility for revenue recognition purposes  we consider a number of factors depending upon the specific aspects of an arrangement  which may include  but is not limited to  the following items i an assessment of the client s specific credit worthiness  evidenced by its current financial condition and or recent operating results  credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing status as applicable  ii the client s current accounts receivable status and or its historical payment patterns with us as applicable  iii the economic condition of the industry in which the client conducts the majority of its business  and or iv the economic conditions and or political stability of the country or region in which the client is domiciled and or conducts the majority of its business 
the evaluation of these factors  and the ultimate determination of collectibility  requires significant judgments to be made by us 
the risk of an incorrect collectibility assessment by us is heightened due to the current depressed state of the global telecommunications industry  as discussed above 
the judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
the accounting for software revenues  especially when software is sold in a multiple element arrangement  is complex and requires judgment 
key factors considered in accounting for software and related services include i the identification of the separate elements of the arrangement  ii whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii the assessment of whether our hosted service transactions meet the requirements of eitf to be treated as a separate element to the arrangement  iv the determination of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various elements of the arrangement  v the assessment of whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  vi the determination as to whether the fees are considered collectible as discussed above  and vii the assessment of whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
the evaluation of these factors  and the ultimate revenue recognition decision  requires significant judgments to be made by us 
the judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
in addition  because software licenses typically have little or no direct  incremental costs related to the recognition of the revenue  these judgments could also have a significant effect on net income or loss 
we utilize the percentage of completion poc method of accounting for certain revenue arrangements 
under the poc method of accounting  revenues are typically recognized as services are performed 
provisions for any estimated losses on uncompleted projects are made in the period in which such losses become evident 
we typically use hours performed on the project as the measure to determine the percentage of the work completed 
our use of the poc method of accounting on a project requires estimates of the total project revenues  total project costs and the expected hours necessary to complete a project 
we believe we have adequate processes to produce reasonably dependable estimates for these items in order to justify the use of the poc method of accounting 
however  changes in estimates as a result of additional information or experience on a project as work progresses are inherent characteristics of the poc method of accounting as we are exposed to various business risks in completing our projects 
the estimation process to support the poc method of accounting is more difficult for projects of greater length and or complexity 
factors that increase the complexity of an implementation project are discussed in more detail in exhibit under implementation project complexities and risks included in this report 
the estimates and judgments made in this area could i have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized  and or ii impact the expected profitability of a project  including whether an overall loss on an arrangement has occurred 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the gss division s total recognized revenues were accounted for using the poc method of accounting 
to mitigate the inherent risks in using the poc method of accounting  we track our performance on projects and reevaluate the appropriateness of our estimates as part of our monthly accounting cycle 
the accounting for software maintenance services generally requires few judgments and estimates as these revenues are recognized ratably over the service period 
however  certain estimations may be required when 
table of contents maintenance services are sold as part of a multiple element arrangement  as a portion of the overall fee arrangement must be allocated to the undelivered maintenance services 
the key judgmental matters considered in accounting for maintenance services in a multiple element arrangement include i the determination of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance services  and ii the period of time maintenance services are expected to be performed 
the judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any one period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances  as well as a general allowance 
specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectibility risk based on such factors  among others  as i the aging of the accounts receivable balance  ii the client s past payment experience  iii the economic condition of the industry in which the client conducts the majority of its business  iv the economic conditions and or political stability of the country or region in which the client is domiciled and or conducts the majority of its business  and v a deterioration in a client s financial condition  evidenced by weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results  reduced credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing 
in addition to the specific allowance  we maintain a general allowance for all our accounts receivable which are not covered by a specific allowance 
the general allowance is established based on such factors  among others  as i the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable  including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable  ii past history of uncollectible accounts receivable write offs  and iii the overall creditworthiness of the client base  including considerations of the economic condition of the global telecommunications industry 
the expansion of our international business as a result of the kenan business acquisition  combined with the downturn in the global telecommunications industry  has increased the complexity in estimating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
since most of our current and future clients operate within this industry sector  the economic state of this industry directly impacts our business  increasing the likelihood of uncollectible amounts from current and future accounts receivable and lengthening the cash collection cycle 
in particular  we experienced collection problems with certain of our international clients in late through the middle of  and have experienced several client bankruptcy filings over the last few years both in the broadband and gss divisions  which required us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable when these matters were identified 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the overall allowance change significantly  an adjustment to the provision for doubtful account receivables may be necessary 
because of the significance of our gross account receivables balance million and related allowance for doubtful accounts million as of december   such an adjustment could be material 
impairment assessment of long lived assets 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
in addition to this annual requirement  goodwill is required to be evaluated for possible impairment on a periodic basis eg  quarterly if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment may have occurred 
under the current accounting standard  goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit which includes the goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its estimated fair value is recorded 
in estimating fair value  we consider the income  market  and cost methods  with the greatest reliance on the income method 
under the income method  discounted future net cash flows are the primary basis of estimating the fair value 
the determinations of future net cash flows and the appropriate discount rate to be used  are by their nature  highly subjective judgments 
the estimation of fair value under each of the three above mentioned methods is more difficult in periods of economic downturn 
long lived assets eg  intangible assets  other than goodwill  are required to be evaluated for possible impairment on a periodic basis eg  quarterly if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate that a possible impairment of these assets may have occurred 
under the current accounting standard  a long lived asset 
table of contents is impaired if future undiscounted cash flows associated with that asset  without consideration of interest  are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
once deemed impaired  even if by  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows 
the determinations of future cash flows and  if required  the determination of the fair value of a long lived asset  are by their nature  highly subjective judgments 
in addition  the estimation of the future cash flows is more difficult in periods of economic downturn 
as of december   we have approximately million in net intangible assets and approximately million of goodwill that are attributable to the gss division  which includes the assets from the kenan  icms  davinci  and planet acquisitions 
due to the continued poor economic conditions of the global telecommunications industry and the impacts this situation had on the gss division s business  to include declining revenues  segment contribution losses  and the initiation of various cost reduction and restructuring programs since the acquisition of the kenan business in early  we performed certain financial analyses to include work by an independent outside valuation firm during the second quarter of and concluded that based on such work  there had been no impairment of the gss division s goodwill or its other long lived assets 
the estimated fair value of the gss division reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately  and the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the gss division s long lived assets exceeded their carrying values by approximately we completed to include work by an independent outside valuation firm our annual goodwill impairment test of the gss division reporting unit in the third quarter of  and concluded that based on such work  there had been no impairment of the gss division s goodwill 
the estimated fair value of the gss division reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately we will continue to continue to monitor the carrying value of the gss division s goodwill and other intangible assets during the economic downturn in this industry sector 
if the current economic conditions worsen and or take longer to recover than anticipated  it is reasonably possible that a review for impairment of the goodwill and or related long lived intangible assets in the future may indicate that these assets are impaired  and the amount of impairment could be substantial 
as discussed above  we have evaluated the million carrying value of the client contract intangible asset related to the comcast master subscriber agreement in light of the recent arbitration ruling  and have concluded there has been no impairment of this asset 
the estimation of the undiscounted future cash flows is more difficult as a result of the arbitrator s decision to allow comcast to unilaterally terminate the master subscriber agreement  and be liable to us under a contractual provision relating to consequential damages  for contract damages in the amount of million 
we will continue to monitor the carrying value of this asset as we discuss with comcast possible modifications to the master subscriber agreement as a result of the arbitration ruling 
further  should comcast terminate the master subscriber agreement  the amortization of this intangible asset would be significantly accelerated 
business restructuring 
we recorded restructuring charges during and related primarily to involuntary employee termination benefits and facilities abandonments 
our accounting for involuntary employee termination benefits generally does not require significant judgments as we identify the specific individuals and their termination benefits in the early stages of the restructuring program  and the timing of the benefit payments is relatively short 
some judgment is needed in determining whether any legal exposure exists from the involuntary employee terminations  especially in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the accounting for facilities abandonments requires significant judgments in determining the restructuring charges  primarily related to the assumptions regarding the timing and the amount of any potential sublease arrangements for the abandoned facilities  and the discount rates used to determine the present value of the liabilities 
we continually evaluate these assumptions  and adjust the related facilities abandonment reserves based on the revised assumptions at that time 
depending upon the significance in the change of assumptions  the changes to the facilities abandonment reserves could be material 

table of contents loss contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to claims and potential claims related to various items including but not limited to i legal and regulatory matters  ii client and vendor contracts  iii product and service delivery matters  and iv labor matters 
we follow the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  in determining the appropriate accounting and disclosures for such matters  which requires us to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes to these matters  as well as the potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves for such contingencies  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of the issues  often with the assistance of legal counsel 
the evaluation of such issues  and our ultimate accounting and disclosure decisions  are by their nature  subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgments 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of any required reserves change significantly  an adjustment to the reserves may be necessary 
because of the potential significance of these issues  such an adjustment could be material 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as purchased in process r d costs  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred income tax assets will be recovered primarily from future taxable income  and to the extent recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had net deferred income tax assets of million  relating primarily to our domestic operations  which represented approximately of our total assets 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize the benefit of our net deferred income tax assets 
the assumption of future taxable income  is by its nature  subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgments 
business combinations and asset purchases 
accounting for business combinations and asset purchases  including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values  requires us in certain circumstances to estimate fair values for items that have no ready market or for which no independent market exists 
under such circumstances  we use our best judgment to determine a fair value based upon inference to other transactions and other data 
as a result  the amounts determined by us for such items as accounts receivable  identifiable intangible assets  goodwill  and deferred revenue are not individually the result of an arm s length transaction  but are the result of management estimates of the fair value and the allocation of the purchase price 
accordingly  revenue recognized by us related to fulfillment of assumed contractual obligations is based on fair value estimates made by us 
for larger and or more complex acquisitions  the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the use of a specialist  such as an appraiser or valuation expert 
the assumptions used in the appraisal or valuation process are forward looking  and thus subject to significant judgments and interpretations by us 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition eg  purchased in process r d assets  ii amortized over their estimated useful life eg  acquired software  or iii not amortized at all eg  goodwill  the assigned values could have a material impact on results of operations in current and future periods 
stock based compensation 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based awards currently consisting of stock options and restricted stock in accordance with sfas no 
 using the prospective method of transition as outlined in sfas no 
under sfas no 
 we use the black scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock based awards as of the grant date 
the black scholes model  by its design  is highly complex  and dependent upon key data inputs estimated by management 
the primary data inputs with the greatest degree of subjective judgment are the estimated lives of the stock based awards and the estimated volatility of our stock price 
the black scholes model is highly sensitive to changes in these two data inputs 
capitalization of internal software development costs 
we expend substantial amounts on research and development r d for both new and existing ie  enhancements software products and related services 

table of contents such costs are subject to capitalization under certain circumstances 
the determination of whether internal software r d costs are subject to capitalization is by its nature  highly subjective and involves significant judgments 
this decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period by either i capitalizing development costs  or ii expensing pre technological feasibility and pre application development stage research costs 
further  once capitalized  the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product 
the determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental 
finally  capitalized software r d costs are subject to the same judgments when evaluating for possible impairment as discussed above for other long lived assets 
we did not capitalize any internal software r d costs  as discussed above  during the years ended december    or in addition  we do not have any capitalized internal software r d costs included in our december  and consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that during these periods no material internal software r d costs were required to be capitalized 
our conclusion is primarily based upon the fact that the feature rich  pre integrated  and highly scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design  coding and testing methodologies  which include next generation software languages and development tools 
development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk 
substantially all of our internal software r d efforts are of this nature  and therefore  the company believes the costs subject to capitalization during these periods were not material

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations consolidated basis impact of acquisitions 
we completed our acquisition of the kenan business from lucent on february  when comparing operating results between years  results of operations include ten months of results from this acquisition  while reflects a full months of results 
we also completed our acquisition of davinci technologies inc in december  and our acquisition of the icms business from ibm in august the icms and davinci acquisitions did not individually have a material impact on the results of operations for the years ended december  and  and have been considered in the year over year results of operations discussed below 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions 
total revenues 
total revenues decreased million  or to million in  from million in of the million decrease  million is related to the comcast charge for arbitration ruling attributable to periods prior to july   as discussed above 
the remaining decrease between periods is due primarily to decreases in processing and related services revenues  software revenues  and professional services revenues 
see the results of operations operating segments section below for a detailed discussion of revenues and related changes between periods on a segment basis 
cost of processing and related services 
the cost of processing and related services revenues consists principally of i data processing and communications costs  ii statement production costs eg  labor  paper  envelopes  equipment and equipment maintenance  etc  iii client support organizations eg  client call centers  account management  etc  iv various product support organizations eg  product management and delivery  product maintenance  etc  and v facilities and infrastructure costs related to the statement production and support organizations 
the cost of processing and related services for remained relatively unchanged between years as it was million for as compared to million for this is reflective of our continued focus on cost controls in this area 
processing costs as a percentage of related processing revenues were margin of for compared to margin of for the decrease in processing gross margin and gross margin percentage was due primarily to the lower comcast revenues during the third and fourth quarters of as a result of the arbitration ruling 
our gross margin percentage for processing services for the fourth quarter of was approximately 
we expect our overall gross margin percentage for processing services to be in a range comparable to this percentage 
cost of software and maintenance 
the cost of software and maintenance revenues consists principally of i amortization of acquired software and certain acquired client contracts  ii client support organizations eg  client call centers  account management  etc  iii various product support organizations eg  product management and delivery  product maintenance  etc  iv facilities and infrastructure costs related to these organizations  and v third party software costs and or royalties related to certain software products 
we do not differentiate between cost of software revenues and cost of maintenance revenues  and therefore  such costs are reported on a combined basis 
the costs related to new product development including enhancements to existing products are included in research and development expenses 
the combined cost of software and maintenance for increased to million  from million for the increase related primarily to i having twelve months of kenan business operations  as compared to only ten months of kenan business operations in  and ii having twelve months of icms maintenance costs and amortization expense as compared to only four months in the cost of 
table of contents software and maintenance as a percentage of related revenues was margin of for as compared to margin of for  with the change due primarily to the decrease in software sales within the broadband division 
as discussed below  fluctuations in the gross margin for software and maintenance revenues are an inherent characteristic of software companies and are expected in future periods 
cost of professional services 
the cost of professional services consists principally of i our professional services organizations  ii subcontracted professional consultants  and iii facilities and infrastructure costs related to our professional services organizations 
the cost of professional services for decreased to million  from million  for the decrease related primarily to a reduction in personnel costs as a result of the cost reduction initiatives discussed below  offset by having twelve months of kenan business operations  as compared to only ten months in the cost of professional services as a percentage of related revenues was margin of for  as compared to margin of for the decrease in the gross margin percentages between periods relates primarily to i the difficulties we experienced on the large implementation project discussed in the immediately following paragraph  and ii a decrease in gss division s professional services revenues between years  which is discussed in greater detail under the results of operations operating segments below 
as part of the kenan business acquisition from lucent in  we assumed the obligation to complete a large systems implementation project for proximus  a belgium telecommunications service provider 
the total estimated revenues expected from this arrangement are million 
for the years ended december  and  respectively  we recognized revenue under this arrangement of million  and million approximately completed 
this project is significantly longer and more complex than our typical implementation projects 
we experienced significant difficulties and delays in completing this project  and in the first quarter of  we announced that we expected an overall loss of approximately million on the project 
during the second quarter of  we amended the contract with this client which modified our obligations and eliminated certain performance penalties 
during the fourth quarter of  proximus went live on the system  at which time  substantially all of our implementation type obligations were completed 
although we ultimately were successful in completing the implementation phase of this project  we expended a significant amount of our professional services resources on this project in at a loss 
as a result  this project had a significant negative impact on our results of operations  in particular  our professional services revenues and related gross margin  and the gss division s overall results of operations 
with the substantial completion of this project as of the end  we do not expect a similar impact to our results of operations from this project 
as a result the various project difficulties we experienced during on this and other projects  we reorganized the delivery function during to better address these matters 
we believe this reorganization has significantly improved the quality of services we deliver to our clients  and will result in improved gross margins going forward 
gross margin 
as a result of the kenan business acquisition  our revenues from software licenses  maintenance services and professional services have increased and become a larger percentage of total revenues 
variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses  maintenance services  and perform professional services 
our quarterly revenues for software licenses  maintenance services and professional services revenues may fluctuate  depending on various factors  including the timing of executed contracts and the delivery of contracted services or products 
see exhibit  variability of quarterly results  for additional discussion of factors that may cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
however  the costs associated with software and maintenance revenues  and professional services revenues are not subject to the same degree of variability ie  these costs are generally fixed in nature within a relatively short period of time  and thus  fluctuations in our software and maintenance  professional services  and overall gross margins  will likely occur between periods 

table of contents the overall gross margin for  decreased to million  from million for the overall gross margin percentage decreased to for  compared to for the changes in the gross margin and gross margin percentage were due to the factors discussed above  principally  a result of the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling and the reduction in the broadband division s software revenues 
our overall gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of was approximately 
we expect our overall gross margin percentage to be in a range comparable to this percentage 
research and development expense 
r d expense for  decreased to million  from million for as a percentage of total revenues  r d expense increased to for  from for the reason for the overall increase in r d expense as a percentage of total revenues  is due to the lower revenues resulting form the comcast arbitration ruling  discussed above 
we did not capitalize any internal software development costs during and the decrease in the amount of r d expense between periods was due to i the discontinuation of the development of our csg nextgen product during the third quarter of  ii a reduction of r d costs in other areas since the second quarter of  to include a reduction of r d personnel as a result of the cost reduction initiatives discussed below  and iii the completion of the development cycle for certain projects 
prior to the kenan acquisition  the primary focus of the gss division was on the development of our nextgen software product 
following the kenan business acquisition  we discontinued the development of csg nextgen as a stand alone customer care and billing system 
during  we focused our development and enhancement efforts on various r d projects for the gss division  including the kenan fx business framework see the business section of this document for additional discussion  which was introduced in late  which includes enhancements to the existing versions of the kenan business product suite  as well as new modules  and enhancements to ccs and related broadband division software products to increase the functionalities and features of the products  consisting principally of the architectural upgrade to ccs which is discussed in greater detail in the business section of this document 
at this time  we expect our investment in r d over time will approximate our historical investment rate of of total revenues 
we expect this investment will be focused on the ccs and the kenan business product suite  as well as additional stand alone products as they are identified 
selling  general and administrative expense 
sg a expense for  decreased to million  from million for the decrease in sg a expense is due primarily to a decrease in bad debt expense between years of approximately million 
one of our larger broadband division clients  adelphia communications adelphia  filed for bankruptcy protection in june  at which time we established a reserve for the pre bankruptcy invoices 
in addition  we experienced difficulties in collecting certain international accounts receivable during  which required us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable during this time period 
the improvement in our overall accounts receivable position in the latter part of  and the fact we had no similar individual client matters in with the same degree of significance as adelphia in  allowed us to significantly reduce our bad debt expense  when compared to in addition  we were successful in collecting certain purchased kenan business accounts receivable in that had previously been written off or fully reserved against 
these collections were recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense in as they occurred after we had finalized our kenan business purchase accounting 
see the liquidity section below for additional discussion of our accounts receivable activities for and this decrease was partially offset by an increase in i legal fees related to the comcast arbitration  and ii stock based compensation expense 
we incurred million of legal fees related to the comcast arbitration and million of stock based compensation attributable to sg a in  as compared to million and million  respectively  in 
table of contents stock based compensation for is expected to be approximately million  with the increase attributed primarily to the completion of our restricted stock for stock option exchange program in december  and the adoption of sfas no 
as discussed above 
the majority of this expense will be included in the sg a expense line item 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in depreciation expense related to the decrease in capital expenditures made during in accordance with our focus on cost controls 
capital expenditures during were approximately million and consisted principally of i computer hardware and related equipment  ii statement production equipment  and iii facilities and internal infrastructure improvements 
depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reflected separately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenues or the other components of operating expenses 
kenan business acquisition related expenses 
in conjunction with the kenan business acquisition  we incurred certain direct and incremental acquisition related expenses during we completed the integration of the kenan business in  and therefore  there were no similar expenses in the acquisition related expenses included in total operating expenses  and the impact net of related income tax expense these acquisition related expenses had on net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  are presented below in thousands  except diluted earnings per share 
in process research and development iprd impairment of an existing intangible asset displaced by software products acquired employee related costs primarily existing csg employee redundancy costs integration costs eg  legal  accounting  etc 
all other total kenan business acquisition related charges impact of kenan business acquisition related expenses on results of operations ie  have reduced operating results net income diluted earnings per share iprd represents research and development of various software products which had not reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date  and had no other alternative future use 
iprd was charged to operations in the first quarter of as of december   substantially all of the iprd projects have been completed  with one remaining project scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of the remaining costs to complete this project are not material 
restructuring charges 
our restructuring charges relate to various cost reductions initiatives implemented primarily as a result of market conditions  and the comcast arbitration ruling 
see note to the our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our cost reduction initiatives and related restructuring charges  including the current activity in the accrued liabilities related to the restructuring charges 
we believe that the operational impact from these initiatives will not negatively impact our ability to service our current or future clients 
cost reduction initiatives related to market conditions in response to poor economic conditions within the global telecommunications industry  during and  we implemented several cost reduction initiatives  consisting primarily of involuntary employee terminations and facilities abandonments  with the greatest percentage of the involuntary terminations occurring within the gss division 
these cost reduction initiatives resulted in restructuring charges in both and 
table of contents in the aggregate  these various initiatives were targeted at reducing operating expenses by approximately million annually  based on various measurement points 
these programs were substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of cost reduction initiatives related to the comcast arbitration ruling 
in response to the expected reduction in revenues resulting from the comcast arbitration ruling  during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a cost reduction initiative  consisting primarily of involuntary employee terminations and a reduction of costs related to certain of our employee compensation and fringe benefit programs  to include a freeze in wages for  with the greatest percentage of the involuntary employee terminations occurring within the broadband division 
this cost reduction initiative resulted in restructuring charges in fourth quarter of the cost savings from this initiative were approximately million in the fourth quarter of the cost savings from this initiative are targeted to be approximately million  when compared to the third quarter annualized operating expense run rate  with the savings expected to be realized somewhat ratably across in connection with the completion of this cost reduction initiative  we expect to record a restructuring charge during the first quarter of  related primarily to involuntary termination benefits 
at this time  we are not able to estimate the amount of the restructuring charge  but it is not expected to be material 
summary of restructuring charges 
the components of the restructuring charges included in total operating expenses  and the impact net of related estimated income tax expense these restructuring charges had on net income loss and diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december  and are as follows in thousands  except diluted earnings per share year ended december  involuntary employee terminations facilities abandonments all other total restructuring charges impact of restructuring charges on results of operations ie  have reduced operating results net income diluted earnings per share as shown above  we recorded restructuring charges related to involuntary employee terminations and various facilities abandonments in and the accounting for facilities abandonments requires significant judgments in determining the restructuring charges  primarily related to the assumptions regarding the timing and the amount of any potential sublease arrangements for the abandoned facilities  and the discount rates used to determine the present value of the liabilities 
we continually evaluate these assumptions  and adjust the related facilities abandonment reserves based on the revised assumptions at that time 
in addition  we continually evaluate ways to cut our operating expenses through restructuring opportunities  to include the utilization of our workforce and current operating facilities 
as a result  there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur additional material restructuring charges in the future 

table of contents operating income loss 
operating loss for was million  or of total revenues  compared to operating income of million or of total revenues for the decrease in these measures between years is related to the factors discussed above  principally  a result of the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling 
our operating income margin for the fourth quarter of was approximately 
we expect our operating income margin to be in the range of to interest expense 
interest expense for increased to million  from million for the increase in interest expense is due primarily to approximately million of interest related to the comcast arbitration award  as discussed above 
in addition  the weighted average balance of our long term debt for was million  compared to million for the weighted average interest rate on our debt borrowings for  including the amortization of deferred financing costs and commitment fees on our revolving credit facility  was  compared to for our estimated interest expense for is approximately million 
other income expense 
other income for  was million  compared to other expense of million for the increase was primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains during income tax provision benefit 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million  or an effective income tax rate of approximately  compared to an income tax provision of million  or an effective income tax rate of for the year ended december the effective income tax rate for was negatively impacted by certain items recorded in conjunction with the kenan business acquisition 
as a result of the comcast arbitration charge  we were in a domestic net operating loss nol position for  and consequently  we recorded a tax benefit 
the income tax rate is impacted by the nol position for  resulting from the million comcast arbitration charge discussed above  and the resolution during of certain federal tax positions and tax refunds from certain jurisdictions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the difference between the income tax provision benefit computed at the statutory federal income tax rate of and the financial statement provision benefit for income taxes included in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of our nol position for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax receivable of million as of december   which results from our ability to claim a refund for income taxes already paid  and from our ability to carry back our nol to prior years 
as of march   we had received approximately million of this income tax receivable  and expect to receive the remaining amount by the end of the second quarter of as of december   our net deferred income tax assets of million were related primarily to our domestic operations  and represented approximately of total assets 
we continue to believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the benefit of these deferred income tax assets 
our assumptions of future profitable domestic operations are supported by our strong operating performances by the broadband division over the last several years  and our future expectations of profitability  to include considerations for the expected impacts from the comcast arbitration ruling  and our planned cost reduction initiative implemented in the fourth quarter of at this time  we expect an effective income tax rate in of approximately 
the estimate of for is based on various assumptions  with the two primary assumptions related to our estimate of total pretax income  and the amounts and sources of foreign pretax income 
the actual effective income tax rate for could deviate from the estimate based on our actual experiences with these items  as well as others 

table of contents results of operations operating segments operating segment information and corporate overhead costs for the years ended december  and  are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
broadband division total revenues 
total broadband division revenues for decreased to million  from million for the decrease in total revenues was due primarily to i the million comcast arbitration charge recorded in the third quarter of  ii lower revenues from comcast in the fourth quarter of as a result of the arbitration ruling  and iii a reduction in software revenues between years 
processing revenue 
processing revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in processing revenue was due primarily to i the million charge for the comcast arbitration award attributed to processing revenue in the third quarter of  and ii lower revenues when compared to periods prior to the arbitration ruling from comcast in the fourth quarter of of approximately million as a result of the arbitration ruling 
the arbitration ruling also required us to measure comcast customer accounts differently for invoicing purposes beginning in october the change is primarily the result of combining the video and internet accounts for the same customer ie subscriber into a single customer account  as opposed to two separate customer accounts as was the case prior to the arbitration ruling  and to a lesser degree  not charging for certain inactive customers 
as a result  our historical breakout of video  internet  and telephony accounts is not comparable 
total domestic customer accounts processed on our system are shown in the table below in thousands 
the december  number reflects the new basis of measurement effective october for comparability purposes  the impact of the arbitration ruling on the december  customer accounts is illustrated in the following table 
december  prior to impact of arbitration ruling impact of arbitration ruling after impact of arbitration ruling december  increase decrease video internet telephony total the increase in the number of video customers after considering the impact of the arbitration ruling serviced was due to the conversion of additional customers onto our systems  and internal customer growth experienced by existing clients 
the decrease in internet customers after considering the impact of the arbitration ruling is due primarily to approximately one million wholesale internet customer accounts that were converted to the respective client s internal customer care and billing application during the second quarter of as of december   our conversion backlog was not significant 
the combined annualized revenue per unit arpu was for and for  with the decrease primarily related to the reduction in comcast processing revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our arpu for the fourth quarter of was  which included approximately related to a one time  special project for a client 
for  we expect our arpu to range from to  with the decrease reflective of competitive pricing pressures and continued tight cost controls on the part of our clients 

table of contents software revenue 
software revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in software revenue was due primarily to several large software sales during  with no similar transactions in we expect the broadband division s software sales in to be more comparable to rather than maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in maintenance revenue was due primarily to lower maintenance revenues from comcast in the third and fourth quarters of as a result of the arbitration ruling 
a small portion of the comcast arbitration award  and the corresponding reduction in fees going forward  are attributed to maintenance fees 
we expect the broadband division s maintenance revenues in to be flat to slightly down from segment operating expenses and contribution margin 
broadband division operating expenses were relatively unchanged between years with at million  compared to million for this is reflective of our continued focus on cost controls for this division 
the cost savings in related to the fourth quarter cost reduction initiative discussed above were not significant 
broadband division contribution margin decreased by to million contribution margin percentage of for  from million contribution margin percentage of for the broadband division s contribution margin and contribution margin percentage decreased between periods primarily due to the impact of the comcast arbitration ruling on processing revenues  and to a much lesser degree  a decrease in software revenues 
gss division total revenues 
total gss division revenues for decreased to million  as compared to million for the decrease in total revenue was due primarily to a decrease in software revenues and professional services revenues discussed in more detail below 
software revenue 
software revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in software revenue was due primarily to the current market conditions of the telecommunications industry 
telecommunication service providers continued to control their capital expenditures during this market downturn in  reducing the demand for the gss division s software products 
we expect software revenues to be flat to slightly up  depending upon the pace at which the market begins to recover 
maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenue for increased by to million  from million for the increase in maintenance revenue was due primarily to a full year of kenan business maintenance revenue in  as compared to ten months of activity in during the first quarter of  we experienced some difficulties in renewing certain software maintenance agreements  and certain software maintenance agreements were renewed at lower than previous rates 
as a result  our first quarter gss division maintenance revenue decreased sequentially over the fourth quarter of by approximately million 
we believe we have stabilized this portion of our business and do not expect to experience similar events going forward 
the gss division s maintenance revenues for the fourth quarter of were million 
we expect our gss division s quarterly maintenance revenues to be comparable to that of the fourth quarter of professional services revenue 
professional services revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in revenue was due primarily to several large projects in progress during which were substantially completed in and early including the impact of the proximus implementation project discussed above  without replacement of comparable projects upon completion 
we typically sell professional services in conjunction with software sales 
one impact of reduced demand for software sales is that we have fewer revenue generating opportunities for our professional services organization 
we expect professional services revenues to be flat to slightly up  depending upon the pace at which the market begins to recover  and our success in selling additional software licenses 

table of contents segment operating expenses and contribution loss 
gss division operating expenses for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in gss division operating expenses is due primarily to cost reduction initiatives that began in the third quarter of  principally a reduction in personnel cost as a result of involuntary employee terminations  and lower bad debt expense between years 
these were partially offset by the inclusion of ten months operating expenses for the kenan business in  as compared to a full year in gss division contribution loss decreased by to million in negative contribution margin of  from million in negative contribution margin of  due primarily to a reduction in gss division operating expenses as discussed above 
we expect the gss division to have a positive contribution margin in corporate corporate operating expenses 
corporate overhead expenses for increased to million  from million  for the increase in segment expenses related primarily to i an increase in legal fees related to the comcast arbitration proceedings  and ii an increase in stock based compensation attributed to the corporate segment 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of stock based compensation 
we incurred million of legal fees related to the comcast arbitration and million of stock based compensation attributable to the corporate segment in  as compared to million and million  respectively  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations consolidated basis impact of acquisitions

the revenues for this segment in consisted primarily of software license  maintenance  and professional services revenues for the ten months of operations of the kenan business  and to a much lesser degree  the professional services revenues for planet 
segment operating expenses and contribution loss 
gss division operating expenses for were million  as compared to million for gss division contribution loss decreased by to million in  from million in the increase in segment operating expenses between periods related primarily to the inclusion of ten months of operating expenses for the kenan business since the closing of the acquisition  and to a much lesser degree  a full year of operating expenses for planet in  compared to only four months in corporate corporate operating expenses 
corporate overhead expenses for  increased to million  from million for the increase in operating expenses related primarily to i the additional marketing and administrative costs to support our overall growth  and to a lesser degree  ii an increase in legal fees related to the comcast arbitration proceedings 
liquidity cash and liquidity 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million  compared to million as of december  we generally invest our excess cash balances in low risk  short term investments to limit our exposure to market risks 
we also have a million revolving credit facility  under which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  our ability to borrow under the revolver is subject to a limitation of total indebtedness based upon the results of a leverage ratio calculation  and based upon the amount of csg system  inc s one of our primary subsidiaries current cash balance 
as of december   approximately million of the revolver was available to us 
the revolving credit facility expires in february 
table of contents our cash balances as of december are located in the following geographical regions in thousands north america principally the us europe  middle east and africa principally europe asia pacific central and south america total cash  equivalents and short term investments we generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash and short term investment balances  but do face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   the cash and short term investments subject to such limitations were not significant 
in addition  our credit facility places certain restrictions on the amount of cash that can be freely transferred between certain operating subsidiaries 
these restrictions are not expected to cause any liquidity issues at the individual subsidiary level in the foreseeable future 
cash flows from operating activities 
we calculate our cash flows from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  beginning with net income loss and then adding back the impact of non cash items eg  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  etc  and then factoring in the impact of changes in working capital items 
the primary use of our cash is to fund our ongoing operating activities 
of the total amount of our  and operating expenses  approximately  and relates to labor costs both employees and contracted labor for i compensation  ii related fringe benefits  and iii reimbursements for travel and entertainment expenses 
none of our us based employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
certain non us based employees are covered under national or company specific collective bargaining agreements 
the other primary cash requirements for our operating expenses consist of i postage  ii paper and related supplies for our statement processing centers  iii data processing and related services and communication lines for our broadband division s service bureau processing business  and iv rent and related facility costs 
these items are purchased under a variety of both short term and long term contractual commitments 
see investing and financing activities below for the other primary uses of our cash 
a summary of our material contractual obligations is provided below as well 
our primary source of cash is from our operating activities 
our business model consists of a significant amount of monthly  quarterly  and annual recurring revenue sources 
the primary sources of such recurring revenues are our broadband division s long term processing arrangements billed monthly and our software maintenance arrangements primarily billed quarterly and annually  principally within the gss division 
this recurring revenue base results in a reliable  and predictable  source of cash for us 
in addition  software license fees and professional services revenues provide for material amounts of cash  but the payment streams for these items are not as predictable 

table of contents our net cash flows provided by used in operating activities  which consists of cash from operations and changes in working capital items  for the quarters and years ended for the indicated periods are as follows in thousands 
these amounts are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
quarters ended march june september december years ended approximately million of the million of the cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter of relates to our agreement to extend the payment terms on a large software transaction across our yearend  thus distorting the cash flows from operations for this quarter 
the negative cash flow used in operating activities of million in the third quarter of relates primarily to the difficulties we experienced in collecting accounts receivable from certain of our international clients in the latter part of  as discussed in greater detail below 
the negative cash flow from operating activities of million in the fourth quarter of relates primarily to the million paid to comcast during the fourth quarter of as a result of the arbitration ruling 
absent this amount  we generated strong cash flows from operating activities for  primarily as a result of our improved cash collections of our international accounts receivable during the last two quarters of this improved performance allowed us to pay amounts to comcast with available corporate funds  without having to draw on our revolving credit agreement 
we believe this table illustrates our ability to consistently generate strong quarterly and annual cash flows  and the importance of managing our working capital items  in particular  timely collections of our accounts receivable 
absent any unusual fluctuations in working capital items  we expect our annual cash flows from operating activities to range from million to million  and would expect the quarterly amounts to be somewhat consistent between quarters 
the key balance sheet items impacting our cash flows from operating activities are as follows 
billed accounts receivable management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining strong quarterly cash flows from operating activities 
our billed trade accounts receivable balance includes billings for several non revenue items primarily postage  sales tax  and deferred revenue items 
as a result  we evaluate our performance in collecting our accounts receivable through our calculation of days billings outstanding dbo rather than a typical days sales outstanding dso calculation 
dbo is calculated based on the billing for the period including non revenue items divided by the average monthly net trade accounts receivable balance for the period 
our target range for our dbo is days 
our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable allowance  as of the end of the indicated periods  and our dbos for the quarters then ended  are as follows in thousands  except dbos quarters then ended in quarters then ended in gross allowance net billed dbo gross allowance net billed dbo march june september december 
table of contents the increase in the accounts receivable balances and the dbo measures since the first quarter of relates primarily to the kenan business acquisition 
as a result of the kenan business acquisition  a greater percentage of our revenues and accounts receivable relate to clients outside the us our billed accounts receivable balance by geographic region based on the location of the client as of december is as follows in thousands north america principally the us europe  middle east and africa principally europe asia pacific central and south america total billed accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts total billed accounts receivable  net of allowance as expected  this greater diversity in the geographic composition of our client base has increased our accounts receivable balance and adversely impacted dbo when compared to our historical experience prior to the kenan business acquisition as longer billing cycles ie  billing terms and cash collection cycles are an inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions 
for example  our ability to bill ie  send an invoice and collect arrangement fees may be dependent upon  among other things i the completion of various client administrative matters  local country billing protocols and processes including local cultural differences  and or non client administrative matters  ii us meeting certain contractual invoicing milestones  or iii the overall project status in certain situations in which we act as a subcontractor to another vendor on a project 
the increase in net billed accounts receivable and dbos from the third quarter of through the end of the second quarter of is primarily the result of the increased aging of certain receivables within the gss division 
during this time frame  we experienced collection problems with certain clients due to various administrative and client specific matters 
in particular  there were two large implementation projects in progress in india where we were executing on the implementation projects generally as expected  but for which we had the following gross accounts receivable balances outstanding as of the end of the indicated periods in thousands quarter ended billed unbilled total december  march  june  september  december  we had originally expected to bill and collect a substantial percentage of the december  amounts by the end of the first quarter of however due to various complications in the billing and cash collection cycle  and specific project related matters that needed to be resolved with these clients  we were not successful in such collections as of march  and june  we have resolved many of the issues that had been causing the delays in collecting these amounts  and as a result  we were successful in significantly reducing the outstanding balances of these two clients by the end of we expect to collect substantially all of the remaining december  accounts receivable from these clients in the first half of in addition  these clients are located within india  resulting in approximately of our net billed accounts receivable being concentrated in this foreign country as of december  there is an inherent risk whenever such a large percentage of total accounts receivable is concentrated within one foreign country 
one such risk is that  should a foreign country s political or economic conditions adversely change  it could become difficult to receive payments from clients within that foreign country 
we do not expect such conditions to occur in india in the foreseeable future  and as a result  we do not believe the concentration of accounts receivable in india subjects us to higher than usual collection risks 

table of contents during  in conjunction with working through the issues that caused the collection delays with these two indian clients  we have made certain improvements in the quality of our delivery functions and in our cash collection processes 
we believe these improvements contributed to our successes in collecting our accounts receivable during the last two quarters of  and will help maintain our accounts receivable balances and dbos at the current targeted levels going forward 
unbilled accounts receivable and other receivables revenue earned and recognized prior to the scheduled billing date of an item is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 
unbilled accounts receivable are an inherent characteristic of certain software and professional services transactions and may fluctuate between quarters  as these types of transactions typically have scheduled invoicing terms over several quarters  as well as certain milestone billing events 
our unbilled accounts receivable and other receivables as of the end of the indicated periods are as follows in thousands march june september december we have consciously managed the unbilled receivables down from their high point in  and going forward  we are targeting a range comparable to that of the third and fourth quarters of the december  unbilled accounts receivable balance consists primarily of several projects with various milestone and contractual billing dates which have not yet been reached 
a substantial percentage of the december  unbilled accounts receivable are scheduled to be billed and collected by the end of the second quarter of however  there can be no assurances that the fees will be billed and collected within the expected time frames 
income tax receivable 
we are in a domestic net operating loss nol position for  primarily as a result of the comcast million arbitration charge discussed above 
our income tax receivable as of december  was million  which results from our ability to claim a refund for income taxes already paid  and from our ability to carry back our nol to prior years 
as of march   we had received approximately million of this income tax receivable  and expect to receive the remaining amount by the end of the second quarter of deferred revenue client payments and billed amounts due from clients in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue broken out by source of revenue as of the end of the indicated periods was as follows in thousands december  september  june  march  december  processing and related services software maintenance services professional services total 
table of contents the changes in deferred revenues related to maintenance services and professional services between december  and december  relates to the timing of invoices for such services 
the majority of our maintenance agreements provide for invoicing of annual maintenance fees in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of the year 
arbitration charge payable the arbitration charge payable reflected in our consolidated financial statements relates to the million comcast arbitration award 
during the fourth quarter of  we paid million of this amount  and paid the remaining million in january investing activities 
our investing activities typically consist of purchases of property and equipment and investments in client contracts  and business acquisitions 
property and equipment client contracts our business is not a capital intensive business 
our biggest capital outlays typically relate to computer and statement production equipment 
our investment in client contracts typically consists of cash payments to clients as an incentive to bring business to our company 
our annual capital expenditures for property and equipment  and investments in client contracts were as follows in thousands property and equipment client contracts as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditure or for investments in client contracts 
our budgeted capital expenditures for are approximately million  which also represents the maximum amount that we can spend for this purpose in under our current credit agreement 
business acquisitions historically  our business model has not included a significant amount of business acquisition activity 
however  in order to expand our international business  in we acquired several different businesses and related assets for million 
this consisted principally of the kenan business acquisition in february see note to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our most recent acquisitions 
during  our business acquisition activity was not significant at million for the year 
our current bank agreement places certain restrictions upon acquisitions 
as a result  we do not expect any significant acquisitions during financing activities 
we have had limited financing activities over the last several years  and historically  we have not been active in the capital markets 
long term debt during  we borrowed million to purchase the kenan business and to refinance our existing indebtedness at the time 
during  we repaid approximately million of this amount  leaving our debt balance at million as of december  we paid million on our debt during of which million was voluntarily prepaid  leaving the balance at million as of december  
table of contents the comcast arbitration award payment would have resulted in a default of our bank credit agreement as of december  if not modified by that date 
in the fourth quarter of  we favorably amended our bank credit agreement and we were in compliance with both the financial and non financial covenants of the agreement as of december  we expect to remain in compliance going forward 
as part of the amendment  we agreed to a basis point increase in the interest rate spread on our bank debt 
we also agreed to a number of other modifications to the credit agreement  including a mandatory payment of million no later than july  a reduction in our revolving credit facility to million and additional limitations on certain investments  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the million payment in july is expected to be funded with our million income tax receivable that is expected to be received during the first half of as of march   we had received approximately million of our income tax receivable  and expect to receive the remaining amount by the end of the second quarter of the total scheduled principal payments for which includes this million payment is million  with the first payment of million due in june our estimated interest expense for is approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our credit agreement  to include a discussion of the key financial and non financial covenants included in the credit agreement 
common stock stock warrants proceeds from the issuance of common stock relates to our various stock based employee compensation plans  primarily from the exercise of stock options 
the significant decrease in cash from these item in and when compared to is a result of the drop in our stock price since that time  which left many of the stock option exercise prices significantly above our stock price 
we do not expect any significant amount of cash from our stock based employee compensation plans in the million in proceeds from common stock warrants in relates to the exercise of two million warrants held by comcast then at t broadband 
these warrants were issued in as part of our acquisition of certain assets from comcast  and for entering into our master subscriber agreement with comcast 
we currently have no warrants for common stock outstanding 
repurchase of common stock in  our board of directors authorized us  at our discretion  to purchase up to a total of ten million shares of our common stock from time to time as market and business conditions warrant 
we did not purchase any of our shares under the stock repurchase program during a summary of the activity to date for this repurchase program is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts total shares repurchased total amount paid weighted average price per share at december   the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the program totaled million shares 
our amended credit facility restricts the amount of common stock we can repurchase under our stock repurchase program to million  and at this time  also restricts our ability to purchase any additional shares until we achieve a certain leverage ratio 
we do not expect to achieve this leverage ratio in and as a result  we do not expect to purchase any shares under this program during contractual obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  but are required to be disclosed 

table of contents the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on our long term debt  assuming no voluntary prepayments are made in thousands 
total long term debt operating leases purchase obligations arbitration ruling payment total our long term debt obligation is discussed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the operating leases obligations are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our purchase obligations consist primarily of our expected base fees under the fdc services agreement discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and data communication services 
of the total contractual obligations and commercial commitments above  approximately million is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and approximately million is not 
capital resources capital resources 
we continue to make investments in client contracts  capital equipment  facilities  research and development  and at our discretion  may continue to make voluntary principal payments on our long term debt 
the scheduled principal payments on our long term debt within the next months are million  with the first payment due on june  in the amount of million 
the total payments include a million mandatory payment due no later than july we expect to fund this payment with the proceeds received from our million income tax receivable 
as of march   we had received approximately million of our income tax receivable  and expect to receive the remaining amount by the end of the second quarter of our estimated interest expense for is approximately million 
as discussed above  we have no significant capital commitments as of december  although it is part of our growth strategy  we are not likely to enter into any significant business or asset acquisitions during as a result of the limitations placed on such activities by our debt agreement 
as of march   we had approximately million of cash and short term investments available for operations which includes the receipt of approximately million of our income tax receivable 
this is after we paid the final million of the million arbitration award to comcast in january we believe that our current cash and short term investments  together with cash expected to be generated from future operating activities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least we believe we can obtain alternative sources of capital resources if necessary  however  the cost for the alternative capital resources would likely be higher than the current costs 
our belief that we can obtain alternative sources of capital resources if necessary is based primarily on our future expectations of operating profitability and future cash flows to be generated from operations  to include considerations for the expected future impacts from the comcast arbitration ruling  and our cost reduction initiative implemented in the fourth quarter of market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fluctuations and changes in the market value of our short term investments 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have not historically entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk 
as of december   we had long term debt of million  consisting of a tranche a term loan tranche a with an outstanding balance of million  a tranche b term loan tranche b with an outstanding balance of million  and a revolving credit facility the revolver  with an outstanding balance of zero 
in may  we made a million voluntary prepayment on our credit facility  and in august  we made an additional voluntary prepayment of million 
as of december   the combined scheduled maturities of tranche a and tranche b are as follows in thousands total tranche a tranche b total payments the interest rates for the revolver and the two tranches of term loans are chosen at our option and are based on a base rate or adjusted libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
the base rate represents the higher of the floating prime rate for domestic commercial loans and a floating rate equal to basis points in excess of the federal funds effective rate 
effective december   the date we amended our credit agreement  the applicable margins are as follows base rate adjusted libor tranche a tranche b revolver prior to december   the applicable margins for the revolver and tranche a loans were for base rate loans and for libor loans  and the applicable margins for tranche b loans were for base rate loans and for libor loans 
we believe the carrying amount of our long term debt approximates its fair value due to the long term debt s variable interest rate features 
we have historically selected libor loans as opposed to base rate loans as the basis for determining our interest rates for our long term debt  and we expect to continue to utilize libor loans in the foreseeable future 
we have the option of selecting the length of time ranging from one to twelve months that we lock in the libor contract rate 
as of december   million of our credit facility s outstanding balance was in a six month libor contract at an adjusted libor rate of for a combined rate of for tranche a and for tranche b that is effective through march  the remaining outstanding balance of million was in a six month libor contract at an adjusted libor rate of for a combined rate of for tranche a and for tranche b that is effective through june  the weighted average interest rates adjusted libor plus applicable margin on tranche a and tranche b was and during and  respectively 
we expect to enter into similar length libor contracts during as a means to manage our interest rate risk on the long term debt 
in addition  we continually evaluate whether we should enter into derivative financial instruments as an additional means to manage our interest rate risk  but as of the date of this filing  have not entered into such instruments 
foreign exchange rate risk 
our approximate percentage of total revenues generated outside the us for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the increase between and in revenues generated outside the us is attributable to the kenan business acquisition in february prior to the kenan business acquisition  our foreign currency transactions related entirely to the operations conducted through our united kingdom uk subsidiary  csg international limited csgi 

table of contents our exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates prior to the kenan business acquisition was not significant due to the small amount of our business conducted outside the us and was further mitigated by the fact that purchases and sales in the uk were typically in the same currency with similar maturity dates and amounts  and certain transactions were denominated in us dollars 
the increase between and in revenues generated outside the us is primarily attributable to the reduction in our revenues in the second half of as the result of the comcast arbitration ruling see the comcast and at t broadband business relationship section above 
factoring out the effect of the comcast arbitration ruling  the approximate percentage of our total revenues generated outside the us would have been 
we expect that in the foreseeable future  the percentage of our total revenues to be generated outside the us will be slightly greater than 
we have become more exposed to the impact of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the expansion of our international business 
we have not historically utilized derivative financial instruments for purposes of managing our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
for  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were denominated in us dollars and the euro 
since a significant amount of our revenues are denominated in us dollars  a decline in the value of local foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in our products and services being more expensive to a potential foreign buyer  and in those instances where our goods and services have already been sold  could result in the accounts receivable being more difficult to collect 
we do at times enter into revenue contracts that are denominated in the currency of the individual country eg  united kingdom  brazil  and japan or the economic union eu where we have substantive operations 
this practice serves as a natural hedge to finance the expenses incurred in those locations 
we are currently evaluating whether we should enter into derivative financial instruments for the purposes of managing our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
a hypothetical adverse change of in the december  exchange rates would not have a material impact upon our results of operations 
market risk related to short term investments 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
our cash balances are typically swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis  and at times  are placed into somewhat longer term cash equivalent instruments 
we have minimal market risk for our cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments
