table of contents insurance although we believe our properties are adequately covered by insurance  we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain full coverage at a reasonable cost in the future 
our insurance costs increased significantly in mid due to various factors and coverage changes  as described below  our premiums for the renewal period were relatively unchanged from the period 
as a result of the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  we elected to purchase the tria coverage upon our insurance renewal rather than stand alone coverage 
our tria insurance coverage is up to million for foreign certified terrorist acts and also includes million of coverage for domestic terrorism 
however  tria currently only mandates that carriers provide such coverage through in addition  coverage under tria includes only physical damage and does not include losses due to biological  chemical or radioactive contamination 
the failure of the government to renew or extend tria or the lack of coverage for the types of contamination not covered by tria could cause terrorism insurance to be prohibitively expensive and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results if a building we own becomes uninhabitable as a result of a biological  chemical  radioactive or other contamination 
in  due to the rising cost of california earthquake insurance  we reviewed our probable maximum loss pml and industry practice related to earthquake coverage for various factors 
as a result of this review  we determined that it was possible to lower our earthquake coverage from million to million 
we believe this will be sufficient coverage but there can be no assurance that such coverage will adequately compensate us for any loss  that our coverage would continue after a loss  or that a loss  even if covered  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

table of contents item legal proceedings hq global stockholders we are currently involved in a lawsuit filed in april by two stockholders of hq global arising out of the june merger transaction involving hq global and vantas incorporated 
these two stockholders originally brought claims against hq global  the board of directors of hq global  frontline capital group and us in delaware chancery court 
the two stockholders allege that  in connection with the merger transaction  we breached our fiduciary duties to the two stockholders and breached a contract with the stockholders 
the claim relates principally to the allocation of consideration paid to us with respect to our interest in an affiliate of hq global that conducted international executive suites operations 
the stockholders asked the court to rescind the transaction  or in the alternative to award compensatory and rescissory damages 
the court determined that it would not rescind the merger transaction  but held open the possibility that compensatory damages could be awarded or that another equitable remedy might be available 
in connection with the hq global vantas merger transaction  we agreed to indemnify all of the individuals who served as directors of hq global at the time of the transaction  including thomas a 
carr  oliver t 
carr  jr 
and philip hawkins  who currently serve as directors and or executive officers of us  with respect to any losses incurred by them arising out of the above litigation as well as related litigation that was resolved in our favor in the second quarter of  if they first tried and were unsuccessful in getting the losses reimbursed by hq global or from insurance proceeds 
it was expected at the time that these former directors would be indemnified against any of these losses by hq global  as required by hq global s certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
hq global has not satisfied its indemnity obligation to these directors and is not considered likely to do so in the future 
as a result  we have paid the costs incurred by these directors in connection with the above litigation 
we have paid approximately  of costs pursuant to this indemnification arrangement  all of which represents amounts paid to legal counsel for these directors for this suit and the related litigation that was resolved in our favor in the second quarter of we believe that these claims  including those asserted against us and against the former directors who we are obligated to indemnify  are without merit and that we and the former directors will ultimately prevail in this action  although we cannot assure you that the court will not find in favor of these stockholders 
if the court did find in favor of these stockholders  such adverse result or any indemnification obligation arising from such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
currently  these stockholders have not asserted the amount of any potential damages and  based on the preliminary proceedings to date  we are unable to determine a potential range of loss with respect to the claims against us or the former directors 
broadband office  inc on may   broadband office  inc broadband office and the official committee of unsecured creditors of broadband office inc filed a complaint in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware against a group of reits  real estate operating companies and individuals  including us  our subsidiaries and philip hawkins  our president and chief operating officer  relating to the formation  management and capitalization of broadband office

hawkins served as a member of the board of directors of broadband office until his resignation from the board of broadband office on may  broadband office filed for bankruptcy protection on may  the complaint  among other things  alleges  breaches of fiduciary duties by us and mr 
hawkins as a member of the broadband office board  seeks to recharacterize our investment as a holder of common stock to be one as a general unsecured creditor and or as a general partner responsible jointly with all other alleged general partners for the outstanding debts of the corporation  and also seeks recovery of alleged preference payments made to us or our subsidiaries 
the plaintiffs seek relief in an amount in excess of million jointly and severally from all defendants 
our board of directors has determined that  based on maryland law and our charter  we are permitted to indemnify mr 
hawkins in connection with these claims  and has authorized us to advance to or on behalf of mr 
hawkins his costs and expenses incurred in defending this claim 
currently our legal counsel is also defending mr 
hawkins in this matter and we are paying those legal fees directly 
if it is later determined that mr 
hawkins was not entitled to indemnification under maryland law or our charter  mr 
hawkins has agreed to reimburse us for any costs or expenses advanced to him or on his behalf 
on october   we filed a motion to dismiss all claims 
table of contents asserted in the complaint 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the judicial process and the early stage of this action  we are unable to either predict the outcome of or estimate a range of potential loss associated with  this litigation including our agreement to indemnify mr 
hawkins 
we dispute the plaintiffs claims and intend to vigorously defend this matter 
while we believe that the outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties

table of contents part ii item market for registrant s common equity related stockholder matters our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol cre 
as of december   there were stockholders of record 
the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of our common stock as reported on the nyse composite tape  and the dividends paid per share of common stock for each quarterly period for the past two years 
q q q q full year high low dividend q q q q full year high low dividend in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to make ordinary dividend distributions to our stockholders 
the amount of these distributions must equal at least i 
the sum of a of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and b of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus ii 
the sum of certain non cash income items 
our strategy is to distribute what we believe is a conservative percentage of our cash flow 
this permits us to retain funds for capital improvements and other investments while funding our distributions 
for federal income tax purposes  distributions may consist of ordinary income  capital gains  nontaxable return of capital or a combination of those items 
distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits calculated for tax purposes constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend  which reduces a stockholder s basis in the shares of common stock and will not be taxable to the extent that the distribution equals or is less than the stockholder s basis in the stock 
to the extent a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder s basis in the stock  that distribution will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder s shares 
every year  we notify stockholders of the taxability of distributions paid during the preceding year

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion that follows is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for the years ended december   and and should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the ability to compare one period to another may be significantly affected by acquisitions completed  development properties placed in service and dispositions made during those years 
the number of operating office buildings that we owned and were consolidated in the financial statements were in  in and in as a result of the recent weak economic climate  the office real estate markets have been materially affected 
the contraction of office workforces has reduced demand for office space and overall vacancy rates for office properties increased in all of our markets through and our operations were adversely impacted 
in  vacancy rates appeared to peak in many of our markets and some positive net absorption of space started to occur 
with respect to our four largest markets  washington  dc  southern california and eastside seattle experienced positive net absorption and decreasing vacancy rates in within the washington  dc region  northern virginia s vacancy rates declined in while downtown washington  dc s vacancy rate increased slightly due to construction deliveries 
however  with a vacancy rate of at the end of  downtown washington  dc remains one of the healthiest markets in the united states 
northern california has experienced some positive net absorption in small pockets  but overall the market has continued to show negative net absorption and increased vacancy rates 
we expect northern california s office rental market recovery to lag behind our other markets 
however  because vacancy rates are still at high levels in most markets  we do not expect any material improvement in leasing conditions until later in the occupancy in our portfolio of stabilized operating properties decreased to at december  compared to at december  and at december  market rental rates have declined in most markets from peak levels and there may be additional declines in some markets in rental rates on space that was re leased in and decreased an average of and  respectively  in comparison to rates that were in effect under expiring leases 
general during  we completed the following significant transactions we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we redeemed million shares of our series b  c and d redeemable preferred stock for million excluding dividends 
we disposed of five operating properties and one parcel of land generating net proceeds of approximately million 
we acquired interests in four operating properties  directly or through joint ventures  for an aggregate investment of million  including assumed debt 
we issued million shares of preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
at the end of  we decided  based on their returns and market factors  that we will exit the portland and atlanta markets as soon as practicable 
we expect to begin marketing these properties late in the first quarter of we intend to reinvest the proceeds from the sale of the portland atlanta properties in other markets where we believe we will recognize a greater return on our invested capital 
a summary of the net book value of the assets and operating results of our portland and atlanta properties as of and for the year ended december  is as follows amount in thousands of total assets net book value rental revenue property operating income property operating income is property operations revenue less property operating expenses 

table of contents during  we completed the following significant transactions we issued million of senior unsecured notes in january  million of senior unsecured notes in november and million of senior unsecured notes in november we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million and million which hedge certain senior unsecured notes  effectively converting this fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
we repurchased and redeemed an aggregate of approximately million shares of our preferred stock for approximately million

we acquired five operating properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including assumed debt 
we disposed of four operating properties one owned through a joint venture for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies and estimates relate to evaluating the impairment of long lived assets and investments  allocating the purchase cost of acquired properties  assessing our probable liability under lease guarantees for hq global workplaces  inc hq global and evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we assess the useful lives of our assets on a regular basis 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  we perform a recoverability analysis based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the property and related assets  such as tenant improvements and lease commissions  are written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if we decide to sell rental properties or land holdings  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans or views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of additional impairment losses which  under applicable accounting guidance  could be substantial 
if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an investment has declined below its carrying value and we consider the decline to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
for example  our evaluation of impairment of our investment in hq global in was based on a number of factors 
these factors included analysis of the financial condition and operating results for hq global  the inability of hq global to remain in compliance with provisions of its debt agreements and its failure to reach an agreement with lenders on a restructuring of its debt prior to the expiration of a forbearance period in december  the losses of key board members and executives by hq global  particularly in the last half of  and the announcement by frontline capital group  hq global s controlling shareholder  in november that it had recognized an impairment in the value of intangible assets relating to hq global 
based on our evaluation  we determined in the fourth quarter of that our investment in hq global was impaired on an other than temporary basis and that our investment in hq global had no value 
accordingly  we wrote down the carrying value of our investment to zero and recognized the loss in continuing operations 
we allocate the purchase cost of acquired properties to the related physical assets and in place leases based on their fair values 
the fair values of acquired office buildings are determined on an if vacant basis considering a variety of factors  including the physical condition and quality of the buildings  estimated rental and absorption rates  estimated future cash flows and valuation assumptions consistent with current market conditions 
the if vacant fair value is allocated to land  where applicable  buildings  tenant improvements and equipment based on property tax assessments and other relevant information obtained in connection with the acquisition of the property 

table of contents the fair value of in place leases includes the effect of leases with above or below market rents  where applicable  customer relationship value and the cost of acquiring existing tenants at the date of acquisition 
above market and below market in place lease values are determined on a lease by lease basis based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between a the contractual amounts to be paid under the lease and b our estimate of the fair market lease rate for the corresponding space over the remaining non cancellable terms of the related leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any below market renewal periods of the related leases 
capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the initial term of the related leases 
customer relationship values are determined based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenant 
characteristics we consider include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the lesser of the initial lease term and any expected renewal periods or the remaining useful life of the building 
we determine the fair value of the cost of acquiring existing tenants by estimating the lease commissions avoided by having in place tenants and avoided lost operating income for the estimated period required to lease the space occupied by existing tenants at the acquisition date 
the cost of acquiring existing tenants is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value is charged to expense 
changes in the assumptions used in the allocation of the purchase cost among the acquired properties would affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses 
as a result of the bankruptcy of hq global  we were required to make estimates regarding our probable liability under guarantees of hq global s performance under four office leases 
after carefully evaluating the facts and circumstances of each property and developments in the bankruptcy proceedings  we accrued a loss of million in  our best estimate of the probable liability related to these guarantees 
our estimated loss was based on such factors as the expected period of vacancy for the space before it could be relet  expected rental rates and other factors 
circumstances surrounding these guarantees changed and we accrued a net additional loss of million in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the amount of security we hold  the financial condition of the tenant and our assessment of its ability to meet its lease obligations  the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations  etc 
our estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on our tenants  particularly in our largest markets ie  the san francisco bay and washington  ie metro areas 
for example  due to economic conditions and analysis of our accounts receivable  we increased our provision for uncollectible accounts and related accrued straight line rents by approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the addition to our provision for uncollectible accounts in was due primarily to a reduction in delinquent tenants as marginal tenants leases were terminated or sublet and the effects of an improving economy

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of capital are our real estate operations and our unsecured credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million available for borrowing under our unsecured credit facility 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under leases at our properties 
our operating cash flow therefore depends materially on the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
our primary uses of cash are to fund distributions to stockholders  to fund capital investment in our existing portfolio of operating assets  and to fund new acquisitions and our development activities 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
we also regularly require capital to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets in connection with large scale renovations  routine capital improvements  deferred maintenance on properties we have recently acquired  and our leasing activities  including funding tenant improvements  allowances and leasing commissions 
the amounts of the leasing related expenditures can vary significantly depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
during  we expect that we will have significant capital requirements  including the following items 
there can be no assurance that our capital requirements will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations 
funding dividends on our common and preferred stock and making distributions to third party unit holders in certain of our subsidiaries  approximately million to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets  including approximately million to fund tenant related capital requirements  approximately million to fund our expected property acquisitions net of our expected property dispositions  million  on a weighted average basis million to retire our senior unsecured notes maturing july  which we expect to pay at or before the scheduled maturity date from the proceeds of a new financing or other borrowings  and approximately million to fund mezzanine loans we have committed to make in connection with two projects for which we are providing development management services 
we expect to meet our capital requirements using cash generated by our real estate operations  by refinancing our maturing senior unsecured notes  by borrowings on our unsecured credit facility  and from proceeds from the sale of properties 
we could also raise additional debt or equity capital in the public market or fund acquisitions of properties through property specific mortgage debt 
we believe that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations and have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business  to fund our operating and administrative expenses  to continue to meet our debt service obligations  to pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements  to acquire additional properties and land  and to pay for construction in progress 
however  as a result of general economic downturns  if our credit rating is downgraded  or if our properties do not perform as expected  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise the expected funds from the sale of properties and or if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we may not be able to pay the dividend required to maintain our status as a reit  make required principal and interest payments  make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
an unsecured lender could also attempt to foreclose on some of our assets in order to receive payment 
in most cases  very little of the principal amount that we borrow is repaid prior to the maturity of the loan 
we may refinance that debt when it matures  or we may pay off the loan 
if principal amounts due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow may be insufficient to repay all maturing debt 
prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing such as possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans may result in higher interest rates and increased interest expense 

table of contents capital structure we manage our capital structure to reflect a long term investment approach  generally seeking to match the stable return nature of our assets with a mix of equity and various debt instruments 
we expect that our capital structure will allow us to obtain additional capital from diverse sources that could include additional equity offerings of common stock and or preferred stock  public and private debt financings and possible asset dispositions 
our ability to raise funds through sales of debt and equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  rental rates  occupancy levels  market perceptions about us  our debt rating and the current trading price of our stock 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the capital markets may not consistently be available on terms that are attractive 
in december  our board of directors approved a plan to restructure the manner in which we hold our assets  by converting to what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership reit  or upreit  structure 
to effect the upreit restructuring  we intend to form a new wholly owned partnership  carramerica realty operating partnership  lp op  to which we will contribute substantially all of our assets and liabilities  including the assumption of the obligations under our unsecured credit facility and our senior unsecured notes  in exchange for the general partnership interest and units of limited partnership in the op 
following the upreit restructuring  substantially all of our business will be conducted through the op and our primary asset will be our interest in the op 
as an upreit  we anticipate that the op will be able to issue units of limited partnership interest in the op to tax motivated sellers who contribute properties to the op  thereby providing us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions of properties 
real estate operations as a result of the recent weak economic climate  the office real estate markets have been materially affected 
the contraction of office workforces has reduced demand for office space and overall vacancy rates for office properties increased in all of our markets through and our operations were adversely impacted 
in  vacancy rates appeared to peak in many of our markets and some positive net absorption of space started to occur 
with respect to our four largest markets  washington  dc  southern california and eastside seattle experienced positive net absorption and decreasing vacancy rates in within the washington  dc region  northern virginia s vacancy rates declined in while downtown washington  dc s vacancy rate increased slightly due to construction deliveries 
however  with a vacancy rate of at the end of  downtown washington  dc remains one of the healthiest markets in the united states 
northern california has experienced some positive net absorption in small pockets  but overall the market has continued to show negative net absorption and increased vacancy rates 
we expect northern california s office rental market recovery to lag behind our other markets 
however  because vacancy rates are still at high levels in most markets  we do not expect any material improvement in leasing conditions until later in the occupancy in our portfolio of stabilized operating properties decreased to at december  compared to at december  and at december  market rental rates have declined in most markets from peak levels and there may be additional declines in some markets in rental rates on space that was re leased in and decreased an average of and  respectively  in comparison to rates that were in effect under expiring leases 
although our top tenants accounted for approximately of our annualized minimum base rents  we believe that the diversity of our tenant base no tenant accounted for more than of annualized minimum base rents as of december  helps insulate us from the negative impact of tenant defaults and bankruptcies 
debt financing we generally use unsecured  corporate level debt  including senior unsecured notes and our unsecured credit facility  to meet our borrowing needs 
as a component of this financing strategy  we continue to unencumber our assets where possible by repaying existing mortgage debt with unsecured debt 
as of december   we had reduced our fixed rate mortgage debt to approximately million  or of our total debt  from million  or of our total debt  as of december  
table of contents we generally use fixed rate debt instruments in order to match the returns from our real estate assets 
we also utilize variable rate debt for short term financing purposes or to protect against the risk  at certain times  that fixed rates may overstate our long term costs of borrowing if assumed inflation or growth in the economy implicit in higher fixed interest rates do not materialize 
at times  our mix of variable and fixed rate debt may not suit our needs 
at those times  we use derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps  forward interest rate options or interest rate options in order to assist us in managing our debt mix 
we will either hedge our variable rate debt to give it a fixed interest rate or hedge fixed rate debt to give it a variable interest rate 
we have three investment grade ratings 
as of december   fitch rating services and standard poors have each assigned their bbb rating to our prospective senior unsecured debt offerings and their bbb rating to our prospective cumulative preferred stock offerings 
moody s investor service has assigned its baa rating with a negative outlook to our prospective senior unsecured debt offerings and its baa rating to our prospective cumulative preferred stock offerings 
a downgrade in rating by any one of these rating agencies could result from  among other things  a change in our financial position or a downturn in general economic conditions 
any such downgrade could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or could increase the interest rates on our existing variable rate debt 
however  we have no debt instruments under which the principal maturity would be accelerated upon a downward change in our debt rating 
our total debt at december  is summarized as follows in thousands fixed rate mortgages unsecured credit facility senior unsecured notes unamortized discount and fair value adjustment  net our fixed rate mortgage debt bore an effective weighted average interest rate of at december  and had a weighted average maturity of years 
million of our total debt at december  bore a libor based variable interest rate and million of our debt was subject to variable interest rates through interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate on borrowings on our unsecured credit facility at december  was 
our primary external source of liquidity is our credit facility 
we have a three year  million unsecured credit facility expiring in june with jp morgan chase  as agent for a group of banks 
we can extend the life of the facility for an additional year at our option 
the facility carries an interest rate of basis points over day libor  or as of december  as of december   million was drawn on the credit facility  million in letters of credit were outstanding  and we had million available for borrowing 
we are currently negotiating with our lenders regarding a new credit facility 
if we are unable to reach agreeable terms on a new credit facility  we anticipate renewing our existing facility 
our unsecured credit facility contains financial and other covenants with which we must comply 
some of these covenants include a minimum ratio of annual ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense  a minimum ratio of annual ebitda to fixed charges  a maximum ratio of aggregate unsecured debt to tangible fair market value of our unencumbered assets  a maximum ratio of total debt to tangible fair market value of our assets  and restrictions on our ability to make dividend distributions in excess of of funds from operations 
failure to comply with any of the covenants under our unsecured credit facility or other debt instruments could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments 
this could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  financial condition or liquidity 

table of contents as of december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants  however  our ability to draw on our unsecured credit facility or incur other unsecured debt in the future could be restricted by the loan covenants 
during the second quarter of  we amended our credit agreement to increase our maximum ratio of aggregate unsecured debt to tangible fair market value of our unencumbered assets unencumbered leverage ratio from to to allow for continuing covenant compliance 
as of december   our unencumbered leverage ratio was 
our unencumbered leverage ratio is most significantly impacted by two key factors the purpose for which we incur any additional unsecured debt and the performance of our operating properties 
incurring additional unsecured debt to acquire additional unencumbered assets does not impact our unencumbered leverage ratio as significantly as incurring additional unsecured debt for other purposes 
the tangible fair market value of our unencumbered properties is calculated based on their operating income and our unencumbered leverage ratio could increase if the operating income of our unencumbered properties decreases 
if our unencumbered leverage ratio increases further  it could impact our business and operations  including limiting our ability to incur additional unsecured debt  draw on our unsecured line of credit  which is our primary source of short term liquidity  acquire leveraged properties or invest in properties through joint ventures 
we have senior unsecured notes outstanding at december  as follows in thousands note principal unamortized discount fair value adjustment total notes due in notes due in notes due in notes due in notes due in notes due in notes due in all of the notes are unconditionally guaranteed by carramerica realty  lp  one of our subsidiaries 
our senior unsecured notes also contain covenants with which we must comply 
these include limits on our total indebtedness on a consolidated basis  limits on our secured indebtedness on a consolidated basis  limits on our required debt service payments  and compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 
we are in compliance with our senior unsecured notes covenants as of december  million of senior unsecured notes mature in july we expect to pay the unsecured notes at or before the scheduled maturity date from proceeds of a new financing or credit facility borrowings

we pay dividends quarterly 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of the board of directors  the ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to stockholders 
the table below details our dividend and distribution payments for and in thousands preferred stock dividends unit distributions common stock dividends cash flows from operations is an important factor in our ability to sustain our dividend at its current rate

capital commitments we will require capital for development projects currently underway and in the future 
as of december   we had a residential project with condominium units under development 
we undertook this wholly owned project in conjunction with an office development project in a joint venture 
our total investment in the residential project is expected to be million 
as of december   we had invested million in this project 
we sold a majority of the condominium units in and we expect to sell the remaining units in as of december   we also had a  rentable square foot office building under construction  of which  rentable square feet had been placed in service  in a joint venture project in which we own a minority interest 
this project is expected to cost million  of which our total investment is expected to be approximately million 
through december   approximately million or of total project costs had been expended on this project 
we have financed our investment in both our wholly owned and our joint venture project under construction at december  primarily from borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect that our credit facility and project specific financing of selected assets will provide the additional funds required to complete existing development projects and to finance the costs of additional projects we may undertake 
as a result of market conditions  we believe we will be limiting our development activities in the near future and expect to concentrate our growth efforts on the acquisition of properties

hq global workplaces  inc in  we began making investments in hq global  a provider of executive office suites 
on june   we  along with hq global  vantas incorporated vantas and frontline capital group frontline  consummated several transactions including i the merger of vantas with and into hq global  ii the acquisition by frontline of shares of hq global common stock from us and other stockholders of hq global  and iii the acquisition by vantas of our debt and equity interests in omnioffices uk limited and omnioffices lux holding company sa we received million in cash in connection with these transactions 
in addition  million of debt which we had guaranteed was repaid with a portion of the cash proceeds 
following the transaction  we owned approximately of the equity of hq global on a diluted basis and our investment had a carrying value of million 
frontline  the majority stockholder of hq global  announced in october that hq global was in default with respect to certain covenant and payment obligations under its senior and mezzanine term indebtedness  was in a forbearance period with hq global lenders and was actively negotiating with those lenders 
in november  frontline disclosed that it had recognized an impairment in the value of intangible assets relating to hq global due to hq global s trend of operating losses and its inability to remain in compliance with the terms of its debt arrangements 
based on these factors  our analysis of the financial condition and operating results of hq global which deteriorated significantly during as the economic slowdown reduced the demand for temporary office space  particularly from technology related tenants and the losses of key board members and executives by hq global  particularly in the last half of  we determined in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of  that our investment in hq global was impaired 
we recorded a million impairment charge  reducing the carrying value of our remaining investment in hq global to zero 
on march   hq global filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws 
during and  to assist hq global as it grew its business  we provided guarantees of hq global s performance under four office leases 
in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings  which were concluded in september  hq global rejected two of these four leases 
one lease was for approximately  square feet of space at two adjacent buildings in san jose  california 
our liability under this guarantee was limited to approximately million 
we reached agreement with the landlord of this lease under which we paid million in full satisfaction of the guarantee in january we recognized this expense in the second lease rejected by hq global is a sublease  which runs through march  for approximately  square feet of space in downtown manhattan 
in june  we received a demand for payment of the full amount of the guarantee 
we joined with hq global in filing suit on july  in hq global s bankruptcy proceedings asking the bankruptcy court to declare that  due to the surrender of the premises by hq global and the deemed acceptance by the landlord under the sublease of that surrender by virtue of its use of the premises  the lease was terminated by the landlord under the sublease not later than february  in light of our defenses and the uncertainity of these proceedings  we had not previously accrued any expense related to the guarantee 
however  on september   the bankruptcy court ruled that hq global did not effectively surrender the premises under the sublease and that the landlord under the sublease therefore could not be deemed to have accepted a surrender 
in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with the landlord under the sublease agreeing to pay million in cash in one payment 
we accrued a provision for loss for this settlement in the third quarter of and paid it in the fourth quarter of one of the guaranteed leases that was not rejected by hq global runs though january  and is for approximately  square feet of space in san mateo  california 
in the second quarter of  we accrued a provision for loss under this guarantee of million based on the assumption that hq global would reject this lease and based on our estimates of the mitigated damages that would be incurred under the lease 
in january  hq global assigned its interest as a tenant in this lease to us and we in turn subleased the space back to hq global at current market rates together with the right to participate in a portion of hq global s future profits  if any  generated by its operations in the space 
these agreements were subject to approval by the bankruptcy court and would have been enforceable only if hq global successfully reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy proceedings 
on september   hq global s plan of reorganization was approved by the bankruptcy court 
based on hq global s reorganization plan being approved and hq global s current operating performance in the space  we reevaluated our estimated loss related to the guarantee and reduced our provision for loss under this guarantee by million to million in the third quarter of new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation requires recognition of liabilities at their fair value for newly issued guarantees 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures  which we have included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of interpretation no 
on january  did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
effective january   we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation costs 
we elected to use the prospective method of transition to the fair value method provided in sfas no 
and  accordingly  the method is being applied for all employee stock compensation awards granted  modified or settled on or after january  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies in which the equity investors lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest or where the equity investment at risk is not sufficient for the entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support from other parties 
the 
table of contents adoption of interpretation no 
in had no effect on our financial statements as we concluded that we are not required to consolidate any of our unconsolidated real estate ventures that we have accounted for using the equity method or the vies described below 
in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
which modifies and clarifies various aspects of the original interpretation 
the adoption of the revised interpretation no 
in also had no effect on our financial statements 
during  we provided mezzanine loans and guaranties to third parties for development management projects 
the purpose of these vies is to build and own office buildings in washington  dc based upon our analysis  we believe that we are not the primary beneficiary of either entity and  accordingly  we do not consolidate them 
our maximum exposure to loss as of december  is million  the sum of our notes receivable and the maximum exposure under the guaranties 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
in particular  it requires that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments be classified as liabilities and reported at fair value and that changes in their fair values be reported as interest cost 
sfas no 
was effective for us as of july  on october   the fasb indefinitely delayed the provision of the statement related to non controlling interests in limited life subsidiaries that are consolidated 
based on fasb s deferral of this provision  adoption of sfas no 
did not affect our financial statements 
we determined that one of our consolidated partnerships was a limited life entity 
we estimate the fair value of the minority interest in this partnership at december  was approximately million and the carrying value of the minority interest at that date was not significant 
we are in the process of amending the partnership agreement to give the partnership an indefinite life 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used measure of operating performance for real estate companies 
we provide ffo as a supplement to net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
although ffo is a widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  ffo does not represent net income calculated in accordance with gaap 
as such  it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance 
in addition  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as follows net income computed in accordance with gaap  less gains or plus losses from sales of operating properties and items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of our performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance  such as gains and losses on sales of real estate and real estate related depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic comparison of operating performance more difficult 
our management believes  however  that ffo  by excluding such items  which can vary among owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
our ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits 
these other reits may not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than us 

table of contents the following table provides the calculation of our ffo and a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years presented in thousands net income adjustments minority interest ffo allocable to unitholders depreciation and amortization minority interests non unitholders share of depreciation  amortization and net income gain on sale of assets ffo as defined by nareit ffo as defined by nareit for the years ended december   and  includes impairment losses on real estate of million  million and million  respectively 
prior to the third quarter of  we followed a practice of excluding such losses from ffo except to the extent they related to land 
however  we revised this practice based on clarification of the sec staff s position on the ffo treatment of impairment losses and guidance from nareit issued during the third quarter of

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future earnings and cash flows and the fair values of our financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates 
market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative and commodity instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or rates 
we manage our risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities with projected cash outflows to fund debt payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures  distributions and other cash requirements 
we may also use derivative financial instruments at times to limit market risk 
derivative financial instruments may be used to convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis  to convert fixed rate debt to a variable rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions 
we use derivative financial instruments only for hedging purposes  and not for speculation or trading purposes

if the market rates of interest on our credit facility change by or approximately basis points  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
this assumes the amount outstanding under our credit facility remains at million  our balance at december  the book value of our credit facility approximates market value at december if the market rates of interest on our interest rate swap agreements change by or approximately basis points  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million 

table of contents a change in interest rates generally does not impact future earnings and cash flows for fixed rate debt instruments  except for those senior notes which have been hedged with interest rate swaps 
as fixed rate debt matures  and additional debt is incurred to fund the repayments of maturing loans  future earnings and cash flows may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
this impact would be realized in the periods subsequent to debt maturities 
the following is a summary of the fixed rate mortgages and senior unsecured debt maturities at december  in thousands thereafter if we assume the repayments of fixed rate borrowings are made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective credit arrangements  a percent change in the market interest rate for the respective fixed rate debt instruments would change the fair market value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the estimated fair market value of the fixed rate debt instruments and the senior unsecured notes at december  was million and  million  respectively
