summary material division our material division has had decreasing revenue during the last two quarters and the losses increased during the year  from  during the third quarter of to  during the fourth quarter of the loss in the fourth quarter of should also be compared to a profit of  during the fourth quarter as a result of heavy rains during the fourth quarter of  our aggregate production was decreased compared to the third quarter  as well as compared to the fourth quarter this  combined with lower average sales prices on our aggregates due to change of product mix  decreased our margins even further 
the heavy rains were at the highest levels for decades 
our cost of block production increased in st 
thomas due to production difficulties during a period of increased production levels 
we have started to import block into sint maarten from external sources to reduce our cost of block in that market 
the results of our ready mix operations improved on most islands  partly from increased revenue  but also from improved delivery costs 
the company began to outsource the ready mix delivery on various islands during  management believes that reduced cost effect should continue in the foreseeable future 
construction division our construction business improved every quarter during we are seeing improved volumes and margins in most of our locations 
the year started with an operating loss of million in the first quarter  a loss of  in the second quarter  followed by operating income of  and  in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
we are projecting strong continuing volumes and profits for at least the whole year of the dredge started being utilized again in the fourth quarter of and has contracts to operate for at least the first six months of water desalination and sewage treatment business we entered into a joint venture with matrix desalination in june to buy  own and operate utility plants 
we have incurred  in expenses during the year 
we have not been able to sell any systems  yet 
however the marketing efforts for water and sewage system contracts have resulted in leads and contracts for our construction division 
we are reviewing and bidding on a number of possible water and sewage system contracts  but there is no assurance that any of them will result in firm contracts 
antigua note during the year the government of antigua did not meet all of its payment obligations 
however  we expect the government to fulfill most of its payment obligations due in and to continue making payments until the amount recorded in our financial statements as of december  is paid 
the recorded principal balance is expected to be paid in full by december  due to the reduction of payments  we only recorded million of interest income from the antigua government in as compared to million in forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the corporation 
the corporation and its representatives may  from time to time  make written or verbal forward looking statements  including statements contained in the corporation s filings with the securities and exchange commission and in its reports to stockholders 
generally  the inclusion of the words believe  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  will  and similar expressions identify statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of and that are intended to come within the safe harbor protection provided by those sections 
all statements addressing operating performance  events  or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to sales growth  earnings or earnings per share growth  and market share  as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating results  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
the forward looking statements are and will be based upon our management s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance  and are applicable only as of the dates of such statements 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
by their nature  all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results  including our revenues from both our construction and materials divisions  expenses  gross margins  cash flows  financial condition  and net income  as well as factors such as our competitive position  inventory levels  backlog  the demand for our products and services  customer base and the liquidity and needs of our customers  may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements or those currently being experienced by the company for a number of reasons  including but not limited to o the strength of the construction economies on various islands in the caribbean  primarily in the united states virgin islands  sint maarten  st 
martin  antigua and puerto rico 
our business is subject to economic conditions in our markets  including recession  inflation  deflation  general weakness in construction and housing markets  and changes in infrastructure requirements 
o our ability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with key customers 
we have a number of significant customers 
the loss of significant customers  the financial condition of our customers or an adverse change to the financial condition of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or the collectibility of our receivables 
o unforeseen inventory adjustments or significant changes in purchasing patterns by our customers and the resultant impact on manufacturing volumes and inventory levels 
o adverse changes in currency exchange rates or raw material commodity prices  both in absolute terms and relative to competitors risk profiles 
we have businesses in various foreign countries in the caribbean 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
we believe our most significant foreign currency exposure is the euro 
o increased competition 
the materials division operates in markets  which are highly competitive on the basis of price and quality 
we compete with local suppliers of ready mix  and foreign suppliers of aggregates and concrete block 
competition from certain of these manufacturers has intensified in recent years and is expected to continue 
the construction division has local and foreign competitors in its markets 
customer and competitive pressures sometimes have an adverse effect on our pricing 
o our foreign operations may be affected by factors such as tariffs  nationalization  exchange controls  interest rate fluctuations  civil unrest  governmental changes  limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political  economic and regulatory conditions  risks or difficulties 
o the effects of litigation  environmental remediation matters  and product liability exposures  as well as other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
o our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion  business acquisition plans  our share repurchase program and general operating activities  and our ability to obtain necessary financing at favorable interest rates 
o changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements  including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations  and environmental laws  in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions  and restrictions on repatriation of foreign investments 
o the outcome of tax litigation in antigua and the compliance review of our edc benefits in the us virgin islands 
o the impact of unforeseen events  including war or terrorist activities  on economic conditions and consumer confidence 
o interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions 
o construction contracts with a fixed price sometimes suffer penalties that cannot be recovered by additional billing  which penalties may be due to circumstances in completing construction work  errors in bidding contracts  or changed conditions 
o adverse weather conditions  specifically heavy rains or hurricanes  which could reduce demand for our products 
o our ability to execute and profitably perform any contracts in the water desalination or sewage treatment business 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us 
should any risks and uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
for these reasons  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is an analysis of the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  consistently applied 
although our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statement  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies and estimates most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for credit losses  valuation of the antigua and barbuda notes  inventories and loss reserve for inventories  cost to complete of construction contracts  assets held for sale  intangible assets  income taxes  specifically the antigua tax assessments  tax on un repatriated earnings  warranty obligations  impairment charges  restructuring  business divestitures  pensions  deferral compensation and other employee benefit plans or arrangements  environmental matters  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures are recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs  for which collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related earnings are not recognized until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine with a reasonable level of assurance what the estimated profit on the project will be 
change orders for additional contract revenue are recognized if it is probable that they will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
we estimate costs to complete our construction contracts based on experience from similar work in the past 
if the conditions of the work to be performed change or if the estimated costs are not accurately projected  the gross profit from construction contracts may vary significantly in the future 
the foregoing  as well as weather  stage of completion and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from management s review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
we consider the age of specific accounts  a customer s payment history and specific collateral given by the customer to secure the receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
if the customers pay a previous impaired receivable  income is then recognized 
o we maintain reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assessments about current and future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were to be less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
if the actual market demand surpasses the projected levels  certain inventory reserves would be removed and the result of operations would be higher than expected 
o we maintain an accrual for retirement agreements with the company s president and certain other employees 
this accrual is based on the life expectancy of these persons and an assumed discount rate  weighted average of percent 
should the actual longevity vary significantly from the united states insurance norms  or should the discount rate used to establish the present value of the obligation vary  the accrual may have to be significantly increased or diminished at that time 
o based on written legal opinion from antiguan counsel  we have not recorded a contingent liability of million  excluding any interest or penalties  for taxes assessed by the government of antigua and barbuda for the years through the government may also assess further taxes for the years prior and subsequent to the assessed tax years 
we are appealing said assessments 
however  if our appeal is not successful  a significant tax liability may have to be recorded 
we do not believe losing the appeal would have an immediate effect on our cash flow  as the government of antigua and barbuda owes us in excess of million  and we have the right of to offset against any amounts owed to the government 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
o the edc completed a compliance review on our subsidiary in the us virgin islands on february  the compliance review covers the period from april  through march  and resulted from the company s application to request an extension of tax exemptions from the edc 
the company is working with the edc to resolve the issues raised 
one of those issues is whether certain items of income qualified for exemption benefits under the company s then existing tax exemption  including notice of failure to make gross receipts tax payments of  and income taxes of  not including interest and penalties 
this is the first time that a position contrary to the company s or any position on this specific issue has been raised by the edc 
the company intends to vigorously contest the edc s interpretation 
in light of these recent events  and based on discussions with legal counsel  the company has established a tax accrual at december  for such exposure which approximates the amounts set forth in the edc notice 
o we have million of un repatriated earnings in our foreign subsidiaries 
we have no intention of bringing these earnings back to the united states  unless we can do so in a tax free or cash flow neutral manner 
however  should we be forced to repatriate the earnings  we would have to recognize and pay a substantial us federal income tax 
the tax would be approximately percent of the repatriated amount  or potentially million 
o we were accounting for the notes receivable from the government of antigua and barbuda under the cost recovery method until april subsequent to a restructuring of the notes  we started to account for the notes using the accrual method 
we record payments received  first to the projected principal reductions for the period  then to accrued interest  and lastly to additional reduction of principal 
interest income is recognized on the notes only to the extent payments are received for accrued interest 
should the payments from the government diminish substantially or become uncertain  we may have to revert to the cost recovery method  impair the notes or adjust the implicit interest rate based on estimated future cash flows 
this could decrease our earnings significantly 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the government did not make certain of its payments due in the fourth and prior quarters of and  consequently  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded  less in interest income compared to the average of the first three quarters of the amount past due was million as of december  we do not believe that the current delay in payments materially affects the recoverability of the recorded amount of the notes receivable 
o we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
o we determine our fixed assets recoverability on a subsidiary level or group of asset level 
if we  as a result of our valuation in the future  assess the assets not to be recoverable  a negative adjustment to the book value of those assets may occur 
on the other hand  if we impair an asset  and the asset continues to produce income  we may record earnings higher than they should have been if no impairment had been recorded 
we are not presently considering changes to any of our critical accounting policies and we do not presently believe that any of our critical accounting policies are reasonably likely to change in the near future 
there have not been any material changes to the methodology used in calculating our estimates during the last three years  except for the company starting to recognize interest income for payments received from the government of antigua and barbuda in april  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the ceo  cfo and the audit committee have reviewed all of the foregoing critical accounting policies and estimates 
comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  total revenue our revenue was million in and million in this percent increase reflects an increase in construction revenue and a smaller increase in materials revenue 
our materials revenue increased percent to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in the sale of concrete  block and cement  offset to a lesser extent by a reduced sale of aggregates 
concrete and block revenue increased and  respectively  mainly due to increased volumes on st 
martin  primarily due to a significant project on the island 
aggregates sales decreased in st 
croix by percent and on puerto rico by percent 
this reduction was due to reduced activity  as well as heavy rains in the th quarter of we are not sure that the concrete volume increases on st 
martin will be sustainable  however  we believe that aggregates volumes will increase during the next two quarters 
we also anticipate that aggregates volumes on st 
croix and puerto rico will increase during at this time we cannot predict total materials revenue in revenue from our construction division increased percent to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity on antigua and aruba 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was approximately million involving projects  as compared to approximately million involving projects at december  from december  through february   we entered into some additional construction contracts 
we are currently in final negotiations for several contracts and we expect the division to increase its volume in we expect the current backlog to be completed during cost of materials cost of materials increased to percent of materials revenue from percent in this increase was primarily the result of reduced margins in the us virgin islands from the sale of lower margin products and lower volumes  and reduced margins on puerto rico  due to lower volumes and high fixed costs 
the margins on st 
martin improved during the year  but are not satisfactory 
we have been able to secure new sales agreements 
with improved volumes  we believe that the profitability should improve 
cost of construction cost of construction decreased to percent of construction revenue in from percent in this decrease is primarily attributable to the marine equipment having profitable work at the end of and being able to obtain more profitable construction contracts during  and also to the varying profitability levels of individual contracts and the stage of completion of such contracts 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense increased by percent to million in from million in the increase in sg a expense was primarily due to  in accelerated depreciation of assets in st 
thomas and antigua   of increased consulting fees  including an expense of  related to the water desalination business 
we also had an increase in property and other taxes of  offset by reduced insurance expense of  and reduced labor and labor related expenses of  as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased to percent during as compared to percent during the previous year 
due to lower profitability and lower volumes affecting certain assets  management upon its review in the first quarter of long lived assets  determined that impairment had occurred to some of our assets 
an impairment expense of million was recognized in compared to  in the company has two batch plants on antigua and  during the second quarter  consolidated its operations to the main facility 
accordingly  the installation cost of the plant that was moved has been fully depreciated and the original plant at the main facility that will be functioning as a spare plant had its book value depreciated through accelerated depreciation to its estimated fair value 
the depreciation expense recorded in the second quarter was approximately in the first quarter  the company recorded an impairment expense of million 
this consisted of the following items st 
martin crusher concrete operations  sint maarten block plant  aguadilla crusher plant  other assets  total  the st 
martin sint maarten operations were determined to be impaired due to continuing losses 
the company could not project sufficient future earnings to cover the long lived assets 
an impairment charge of  was recorded to write down the st 
martin crusher and concrete plant to their estimated fair value  using an estimated probable sales price as determinant of the value 
management is reviewing its alternatives and has not yet made a decision about future operational changes 
the sint maarten concrete and aggregate sales operations have an estimated fair value in excess of recorded long lived assets  and therefore no impairment was recorded for this part of the business 
the sint maarten block plant was impaired and an operational decision has been made to close the plant and dismantle it 
the company is currently importing part of its need for blocks from devcon plants on other islands 
the plant in aguadilla  puerto rico  is leased to a third party  whose extraction permit was cancelled in february this year 
on april  the lessee asked for a moratorium on payments  at the same time as he gave notice of the extraction permit being cancelled 
as a result of these actions  management s expectation of future cash flows and the fact that the only source of revenue for the plant has come from the lessee  the company recorded an impairment charge of  to write down the plant to its estimated fair value 
on september  the third party received its extraction permit and has started aggregates processing operations 
during the year the company incurred additional retirement and severance expense due the retirement of several executives of the company  termination of truck and equipment operators  as well as a reduction in the interest rate used in the net present value calculation of the obligations 
the total expense for was million  as compared to million in the company has taken measures to diminish said retirement cost in the future  nevertheless  the retirement expense can vary in the future due to fluctuations in the interest rate to discount future obligations to present value 
future severance cost can be affected by strategic initiatives of the company  and should be offset by future savings 
the k savings plan matching in the us  has been slightly increased so that additional retirement costs will not be necessary when an employee retires from the company 
currently  a senior executive intends to retire at the end of the total cost for his retirement agreement  which was finalized in december  will be approximately  during the fourth quarter  we recorded  of expense for past services and the balance of approximately  will be recorded over his remaining service time in operating loss income we had an operating loss of million in  compared to a loss of million in our materials division had an operating loss of million in  compared to  in this increased operating loss is mainly due to a million impairment of long lived assets in st 
martin and puerto rico   of accelerated depreciation in st 
thomas and antigua and million lower gross margins on sales 
the lower gross margin resulted primarily from the quarry operations 
we had unusually heavy rains on most islands we operate in the fourth quarter of this resulted in reduced volumes in st 
croix and puerto rico and the gross margins were reduced by million and  respectively 
the change in product mix on st 
thomas resulted in a lower average selling price  even though costs remained basically the same 
st 
thomas also suffered from production problems in its block plant  which had a material adverse effect on margins 
accordingly  the gross margin in st 
thomas was reduced by  operations volumes increased in sint maarten st 
martin  which resulted in an  increase in gross margin 
sg a expense was slightly reduced for the division 
our construction division had an operating loss of  in compared to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the marine division s having some profitable work in and being idle in we also had improved margins on certain contracts during the current backlog is the same as at the end of  however  we believe we can achieve success in our current negotiations and bids for new contracts 
we believe that we will see continuing improved results for the division in other income at the time of the sale of the operations in dominica in  the company entered into a profit and loss participation agreement that expired on march  during this time the gain on the sale of the operations was deferred 
at march   the company recognized a gain on sale of business of million 
we realized joint venture equity earnings of  primarily from a sale of a parcel of land in south florida 
gain on sale of equipment was  in  compared to  for the previous year 
our interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to reduced interest rates 
our interest income was million in  a reduction from million compared to the previous year 
interest recognized on notes receivable due from the government of antigua and barbuda decreased in by million  while interest received on outstanding accounts receivable increased 
the gain on joint venture equity is derived primarily from a sale of a lot in a south florida joint venture in income tax expense income tax expense increased to million in from  in during  the company recognized a tax exposure accrual related to the compliance notice received from the edc in the us virgin islands where it mentions the company s failure to make gross receipts tax payments of  and income taxes of  not including interest and penalties 
we believe we have valid defenses to the notice and intend to vigorously challenge the notice 
our tax rate varies depending on the level of our earnings in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate  the tax loss carry forwards and tax exemptions available to us 
the effective tax rate was negative percent in as compared to percent in the company is currently appealing tax assessments in antigua for million  as has been previously discussed 
see also item and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  total revenue our revenue was million in and million in this percent decrease reflects a decrease in materials revenue  partially offset by an increase in construction revenue 
our materials revenue decreased percent to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to reduction in sale of concrete  block and aggregates  and reduced sale of cement due to the termination of our cement distribution agreement with union maritima international  sa on march  concrete and block revenue diminished and  respectively  mainly due to the completion in early of a large construction project on st 
croix and reduced volumes on st 
martin  offset to a lesser extent by improved volumes on antigua 
aggregates revenue was reduced by  mainly due to reduced activity on puerto rico  offset to a lesser extent by improved volumes on antigua 
we believe the poor result on sint maarten st 
martin is a result of a slowdown in the island s economy due to reduced tourism on that island in the aftermath of the events of september  however  we have seen continued strengthening demand in the us virgin islands and antigua over the last year 
revenue from our construction division increased percent to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased activity in the bahamas and the us virgin islands 
our backlog of unfilled portions of land development contracts at december  was approximately million involving projects  as compared to approximately million involving projects at december  the backlogs of the contracts on exuma in the bahamas at december  were approximately million 
since december   through february   we have entered into new construction contracts in the caribbean amounting to approximately million 
cost of materials cost of materials increased slightly to percent of materials revenue from percent in this increase was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue  which resulted in fixed costs of sales weighing heavier on the margins for the division  and reduced margins in st 
martin 
cost of construction cost of construction increased to percent of construction revenue in from percent in this increase is primarily attributable to the marine equipment having profitable work in and being idle in  the cost of which includes depreciation and continuous maintenance of the equipment  and also to the varying profitability levels of individual contracts and the stage of completion of such contracts 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by percent to million in from million in the increase in sg a expense was primarily due to retirement and severance expense and losses on foreign exchange 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased to percent during as compared to percent during the previous year 
due to lower profitability and lower volumes affecting certain assets  management upon its review in and of long lived assets  determined that impairment had occurred to some of our assets 
an impairment expense of  was recognized in compared to  in operating loss income we had an operating loss of million in compared to income of  in our materials division had an operating loss of  in  compared to  in this increased operating loss is mainly due to the operations on sint maarten st 
martin  offset to a lesser extent by improved results on other islands  in particular antigua and st 
thomas 
the operations in sint maarten st 
martin were affected by lower volumes  increased costs in terms of severance expenses and loss on foreign exchange 
although there is no assurance  we believe that the operations in sint maarten st 
martin will improve during  due to earlier lay offs of personnel and projected improved volumes 
however  the operations may not reach a break even level in the near future 
we see some continuing strength in st 
thomas and antigua  but do not presently anticipate significant changes in puerto rico and st 
croix 
our construction division had an operating loss of million in compared to income of million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the marine division s having profitable work in and being idle in  also we had lower margins on some contracts during other income at the time of the sale of the operations in dominica in  the company entered into a profit and loss participation agreement that expired on march  during this time the gain on the sale of the operations was deferred 
at march   the company recognized a gain on sale of business of million 
gain on sale of equipment was  in  compared to  for the previous year 
our interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to a reduction of outstanding debt and reduced interest rates 
our interest income of million remained approximately the same in compared to the previous year  interest recognized on notes receivable due from the government of antigua and barbuda increased in  while interest received on outstanding accounts receivable diminished 
the minority interest allocation of losses decreased to in from  in  mainly due to losses in puerto rico cannot be allocated to the joint venture partners  as their equity has been exhausted 
income tax benefit expense income taxes decreased to  in from  in our tax rate varies depending on the level of our earnings in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate  the tax loss carry forwards and tax exemptions available to us 
the effective tax rate was percent in as compared to percent in the company is currently appealing tax assessments in antigua for million  as has been previously discussed

liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the construction business  we expend considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
our capital needs are greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our construction services 
during  we financed million  and the outstanding balance of the financed construction contracts as of december  was million  all of which is due to be paid at different times within the next three years 
accounts receivable for the materials division are typically outstanding for days or longer 
our business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment  along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs 
management believes our cash flow from operations  existing working capital  and funds available from lines of credit are adequate to meet our needs during the next months 
historically  we have used a number of lenders to finance a portion of our machinery and equipment purchases 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding to these lenders 
management believes it has significant collateral and financial stability to be able to obtain significant financing  should it be required  though no assurances can be made 
as of december   our liquidity and capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and available lines of credit of million 
total outstanding liabilities were million as of december   compared to million a year earlier 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was an increase in receivables of million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  the primary source of cash from operating activities was mainly an increase in taxes payable of million  an increase in deferred gain and other non current liabilities of million  a decrease in inventories of  a decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings of  and an increase in billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings of  net cash provided by investing activities was million in  including payments received on notes of million  partially offset by purchases of property  plant  and equipment of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million  including purchases of treasury stock of million  partially offset by issuance of stock of  our accounts receivable averaged days of sales outstanding dso as of december  this is an increase in dso from days at the end of december the company s materials division increased its dso to days as compared to days at the end of the previous year 
the increase in dso was particularly noticeable in st 
croix  puerto rico and sint maarten 
the slowdown in the economy of st 
croix and puerto rico has had a negative effect on our collections 
the construction division also increased its dso to days as compared to days at the end of last year 
the increase was due to large receivables in aruba as well as increasing activity in antigua during the fourth quarter of we do not consider notes receivable in this calculation 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have a million unsecured overdraft facility from a commercial bank in the united states 
the facility is due on demand and bears interest at a rate variable with libor 
the bank can demand repayment of the loan and cancellation of the overdraft facility  if certain financial or other covenants are in default 
at december   we had no amount outstanding under this line 
this facility was put in place to help cash management strategies 
we have similar overdraft facilities with caribbean banks totaling  at december   we had no outstanding amounts on these facilities 
at december  we had borrowed million from the company s president 
the note to the president is unsecured and bears interest at the prime rate 
presently   is due on demand and million is due on july  the president has the option to make the note due on demand should a change of control occur 
a change of control is deemed to have occurred if a person or group acquires percent or more of the common stock or announces a tender offer that  if successful  would result in ownership by a person or group of percent or more of the common stock 
we purchase equipment as needed for our ongoing business operations 
we are currently replacing or upgrading some equipment used by the materials division  principally concrete trucks and quarry equipment 
this resulted in a net cash expenditure of million in at present  management believes that our inventory of construction equipment is adequate for our current contractual commitments and operating activities 
we believe we have available funds or can obtain sufficient financing for our contemplated equipment replacements and additions 
new construction contracts may  depending on the nature of the contract and job location and duration  require us to make significant investments in heavy construction equipment 
during we sold equipment with an original cost basis of million and a net book value of million 
the net proceeds  consisting of cash and notes receivable  were million 
we realized a gain of approximately  on these transactions 
in september  the company decided to stop its operations in aguadilla  puerto rico 
there was no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the company has leased  with the option to buy  its equipment on this site to a company controlled by one of the joint venture owners of the company s subsidiary in puerto rico 
the lease rate should generate a small amount of income after depreciation and interest on the equipment 
our notes receivable at december  include million in promissory notes from the government of antigua  with approximately  classified as a current receivable
