item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we make statements in this report that are forward looking  that is  statements that are not historical facts but that convey projections about the future 
for example  statements containing the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  estimates  intends  may  projects  will  would  and similar expressions may be forward looking statements 
however  we caution investors not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements in this report because these statements speak only as of the date when made 
furthermore  we are not obligated to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements  including without limitation the factors described below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
overview rsa security inc helps organizations protect their information and manage identities of the people and applications accessing and exchanging information 
with thousands of customers around the globe  we provide interoperable solutions for establishing online identities  access rights and privileges for people  applications and devices 
we sell our two factor user authentication  certificate processing  web access management and encryption products and solutions to corporate enterprise users seeking turnkey security solutions  and to original equipment manufacturers  developers and corporate enterprise users seeking software development components for embedding security in a range of software applications or hardware devices 
we derive our operating revenue primarily from two distinct product groups enterprise solutions  which includes rsa securid authenticators  rsa ace server software  rsa cleartrust software  rsa keon software  and maintenance and professional services associated with those products  and developer solutions  which includes rsa bsafe encryption software and protocol products  rsa keon components  and maintenance and professional services associated with those products 
we believe sales of our products will be driven by the trend of enterprises permitting remote access to internal resources and web enabling of existing applications 
sales of our rsa securid authenticator products continue to generate substantial revenue for us  while our less mature enterprise software products are building revenue and market share 
we believe the decrease in the number of technology companies funding development and the availability of free  open source products that compete with our rsa bsafe product line continue to put pressure on our developer solutions revenue 
we believe our product line synergies and strength of our customer base create opportunities to sell additional products to existing customers 
however  information technology budgets remain constrained  which has had and could continue to have a direct effect on the sale of our products 
our enterprise solutions customers typically place an initial order for a limited number of users  for either our rsa securid authenticators or any of our software products  and deploy additional authenticators or software licenses as their need for our products within their enterprise increases 
authenticators have a programmed life of two to five years  and as they expire  our customers typically place additional orders for replacement authenticators 
we typically base our rsa ace server  rsa keon and rsa cleartrust software license fees on the number of users authorized under each customer s license 
in most cases  customers will also enter into an annual customer support agreement for their software license at the time of initial purchase and renew this support agreement annually 
our support agreement entitles our customers to license software upgrades and telephone support 
our developer solutions software licensing terms vary by product and customer 
typical licensing terms may include an initial prepaid license fee and ongoing royalties paid as a percentage of the developer s product or service revenue  or payment of annual license fees  or a single fully paid up license fee 
often  our existing developer customers go on to license new software or technology from us or wish to increase the field of use rights for the technology they have already licensed 
in such a case  we amend our license agreement with the customer and charge additional licensing fees  thus deriving additional revenue 
our professional services group provides customers with project management  architecture and design  physical deployment  custom development  education and practitioner certification services 
customers typically pay for professional services either at a fixed price or at hourly or daily rates for the time it takes us to complete the project 
we have contracted with outside manufacturing organizations to produce our rsa securid authenticators  and some of our products contain technology that is licensed from third parties 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture and delivery of rsa securid authenticators and royalty fees that we pay for the licensed technology 
cost of revenue also includes warranty obligation expense and labor and overhead costs associated with professional services  customer support  and production activities 
production costs include the programming labor  shipping  inspection and quality control functions associated with the 
table of contents rsa securid authenticators 
we are currently working to establish new supplier relationships in order to increase the number of vendors from which we buy our authenticators and authenticator components  in order to reduce our vulnerability to potential supply problems 
we distribute our products through direct sales to end user customers  and through indirect sales  including sales to resellers and distributors that we ship directly to the end user customer and sales to distributors for stocking purposes 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was from sales to distributors shipped directly to the end user and resellers  approximately of our revenue was from direct sales to end user customers  and approximately of our revenue was from sales to stocking distributors 
our stocking distributors provide us with inventory level and point of sale reports on a monthly basis 
based upon these reports  we estimate that our stocking distributors typically hold approximately four weeks of inventory on hand in the distribution channel 
our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are denominated in us dollars and local currency  with the majority of our sales denominated in us dollars 
our sales through indirect distribution channels are generally denominated in us dollars 
for countries outside the united states  we generally pay our operating expenses in local currency 
where we do invoice customers in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time of invoice until collection occurs 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations between the time we collect in us dollars and the time we pay our operating expenses in local currency 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets 
prior to january   we reported two segments  e security solutions and rsa capital 
we have modified our segment disclosure to reflect the divestiture of substantially all of our investments held in rsa capital and the reduction of resources allocated to rsa capital 
accordingly  we began reporting one segment  the e security solutions segment  after january  we have revised our segment disclosure to conform to the current period presentation 
information on our segment may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructurings  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from two sources sales of products  including hardware and software licenses  and services  including maintenance  support and professional services 
our management must make and use judgments and estimates in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
we reduce revenue by provisions for estimated sales returns 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period may materially differ if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates in establishing our allowance for sales returns 
an increase in our allowance for sales returns would reduce our revenue in the period for which the increase is recorded 
for all sales  we use a binding contract  purchase order or another form of documented agreement as evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
sales to our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
we consider delivery to occur when we ship the product  so long as title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the sale amount is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the documented agreement 
if we determine the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the fee is fixed 
we assess if collection is probable based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 

table of contents if we determine that collection is not probable  we do not record revenue until such time as collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we do not generally include acceptance provisions in arrangements with customers  however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  we recognize revenue upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we recognize revenue upon shipment of product to stocking distributors who have only limited return rights  and record a sales return reserve to provide for estimated product returns 
we estimate product returns from distributors based upon historical experience 
when arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using the residual method 
we base our determination of vsoe of fair value of each of the undelivered elements in multi element arrangements on either the price we charge when the same element is sold separately or the price established by the members of our management  who have the relevant authority to set prices  for an element not yet sold separately 
for arrangements containing multiple elements where vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements until vsoe of fair value exists or all elements have been delivered 
we defer maintenance service revenue  whether sold separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement  and recognize it ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  generally twelve months 
we recognize revenue allocated to professional service elements as the services are performed 
when the customization is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  then both the software license and professional services revenue are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which requires revenue to be recognized as a percentage of the project completed 
we recognize revenue and gross profit using labor hours as an input measure of progress to completion on these arrangements 
allowance for sales returns we record allowances for estimated sales returns and allowances on products and maintenance and professional service related revenue in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  current economic trends  product line and customer industry data and other known factors 
our historical experience with sales returns varies by product line depending on the customer  industry and market 
we must make judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the allowances for estimated sales returns in any reporting period 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any reporting period may materially differ if actual sales returns and allowances differ from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable and the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  and current economic trends  regional factors and other known factors when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the analysis and estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable  we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
actual results could differ from the allowances for doubtful accounts recorded  and this difference may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we record recoveries of accounts previously written off as uncollectible as increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for warranty obligations our standard practice is to provide a warranty on all rsa securid hardware authenticators for the customer selected programmed life of the authenticator generally two to five years and to replace any defective authenticators other than authenticators damaged by a user s abuse or alteration free of charge 
we sell our other products to customers with a warranty for product defects for a specified period  generally ninety days 
we provide reserves for warranty obligations based on historical failure and defective return rates  and include these costs as a component of product cost of revenue 
we reevaluate the estimate of warranty and defective return obligations  including the assumptions about estimated failure and return rates  each quarter 
during and  our analysis of historical failure and defective return rates indicated that certain authenticators produced between and were subject to higher defect and failure rates than we had previously experienced 
accordingly  we increased our provisions for warranty obligations by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we will continue to monitor warranty claims and reevaluate our estimate of warranty and defective return obligations in future periods  which may result in our recording additional warranty expense 
actual warranty returns could differ from the allowance for warranty obligations recorded 

table of contents we monitor warranty claims and address defects through our quality and design processes  which are managed by our product engineering  quality control and technical support organizations 
during the last several years  we have increased programs and initiated new programs to build an expanded family of high performance authentication solutions 
these programs have resulted in the redesign and re engineering of authenticator products to improve performance and reliability by incorporating new microprocessors  electronics  firmware and batteries with longer life 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
a change in our estimate of income by jurisdiction could cause a change in our annual effective tax rate 
the income tax accounting process involves our estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of acquisition related net operating losses carried forward 
we base the valuation allowance on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and earnings and other factors used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
we generally determine fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we perform an annual test for impairment of our goodwill as of november of each year and  if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount  will perform an interim impairment test 
we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of november   by comparing the carrying amount of the enterprise to the estimated fair value of the enterprise 
estimated fair value of the enterprise was determined based upon the market multiple valuation method  which requires that we utilize estimates of future cash flows  revenue and earnings 
as of november   the fair value of the enterprise was greater than the carrying amount of the enterprise 
therefore  our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of november  did not result in an impairment of our goodwill 
at december   we had approximately million of goodwill  which accounted for approximately of our total assets 
any goodwill impairment test could result in a decrease to the carrying value of goodwill and could have a material effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position 
restructurings during and  we initiated consolidation of certain operations in order to enhance operational efficiency and reduce expenses  and recorded significant restructuring charges in connection with these actions 
restructuring charges totaled million in and million in these restructuring charges and our continued analysis of our facilities require us to make estimates based upon real estate market conditions  rental rates  future corporate requirements  general economic conditions and future estimated cash flows 
included in the restructuring charges recorded in are facility exit costs of million  which represents estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to lease payments due through under certain exited facilities lease agreements  impaired leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures  and other associated facilities expenses 
we base estimates related to anticipated sublease market rates for excess facilities on assumptions regarding the time period required to locate and contract with suitable subtenants and base these assumptions on market trend information analysis 
we continue to monitor and assess our facility obligations  real estate markets and our operating expenses 
as a result of these ongoing assessments  during we revised estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
these revisions resulted in no net change to our restructuring liability at december  we revised estimates included in facility exit charges based upon the terms of finalized subleases obtained during  due to lower than anticipated operating costs and other direct costs associated with certain exited facilities  and due to revisions in anticipated headcount growth 
these revised estimates of excess facility costs resulted in a net increase to facility exit costs of million at december  in addition  we reduced our severance restructuring reserve by million at december  when we determined our remaining severance and other outplacement costs were lower than originally estimated 
we also reduced our restructuring reserve of costs associated with the liquidation of our swedish development operations and the sale of certain swedish assets by million at december  when we determined we had no legal and consulting costs remaining in connection with this transaction 

table of contents we will continue to monitor and asses our facility obligations  real estate markets and our operating expenses 
if the assumptions for the estimates used in our restructuring reserve change due to changes in the real estate and sublease markets  or due to the terms of sublease agreements that we have obtained  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these facilities could vary by material amounts  and could cause us to record additional or revise previously recorded restructuring charges in future reporting periods which could have a material effect on our results of operations and consolidated position 
new accounting pronouncements interpretation no 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was revised by fin r issued in december fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie that either do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or for which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
fin also sets forth certain disclosure requirements regarding interests in vie that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
fin applies to interim periods ending after march  we believe the adoption of fin will not require the consolidation of our investment in crosby and therefore will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

we believe our identity and access management solutions promote our product synergies and enable us to generate additional revenue by selling additional products to existing customers 
we also believe that as new  lower cost remote access technologies become available and as employment rates increase  we will benefit with increased total product revenue 
however  information technology budgets continue to be constrained  and the continued uncertainty in the economy may affect revenue generated from the sales of our products in future quarters 
our rsa securid authentication product line generates a substantial portion of our revenue 
authenticator units sold  in thousands of units  were as follows percentage increase decrease number of authenticator units sold average selling price 
table of contents the increase in number of units sold  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price in as compared to  contributed to the increased revenue from our rsa securid authentication product line 
the decrease in the average selling price can be attributed to an increase in the number of larger volume transactions during as compared to  because we tend to give larger discounts on larger volume transactions 
we believe our rsa securid authentication products generate and will continue to generate substantial revenue for us 
our sales to the financial services  technology and telecommunications vertical markets continue to provide increased revenue for us 
in addition  we believe the increase in our total revenue can be attributed in part to the continued adoption of our authentication products by an increasing number of small and mid size businesses  combined with existing larger customers expanding their deployments of our products 
we believe the increase in our web access management revenue is due in part to an increase in the number of companies opening up their information and applications to internal and external users 
we believe that our web access management revenue will continue to grow due to introductions of new enhancements to our products  strong technology and strategic partnerships 
in addition  we have made a change to our sales strategy to dedicate a portion of our sales force to focus on selling our emerging products  while selling our more mature products through our resellers and distributors 
the decrease in developer solutions and encryption revenue during as compared to was primarily due to the decrease in the number of technology companies funding development of new information technology products  and the availability of free  open source products that compete with our rsa bsafe product line and which continue to put pressure on our developer solutions revenue 
we believe that our developer solutions revenue may benefit from companies needs to secure their transactions due to regulatory requirements 
we currently believe our developer solutions revenue will represent to of total revenue over the next twelve months 
the increase in service revenue for as compared to can primarily be attributed to purchases by new customers coupled with high renewals of annual maintenance contracts from sale of products in prior periods 
we believe that as the united states government proceeds with its agenda of increasing awareness and funding of cyber security issues and its focus on homeland security  we will benefit with increased revenue 
we believe the government sector of our business may increase in the future as government agencies seek e security partners in order to execute their cyber security agenda 
however  revenue from the government sector of our business was consistent during as compared to as the united states government continued to defer its information technology spending 
we believe our revenue from the healthcare and financial services markets will continue to increase due to required compliance with industry specific privacy and security laws standards 
gross profit the following tables set forth the gross profit and gross margin for products and maintenance and professional services years ended december  in millions gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin products maintenance and professional services total total gross profit and gross margin and gross profit products and gross margin products reflect the reclassification of amortization of technology related intangible assets of million from operating expense to cost of revenue for the year ended december   and also reflects the reclassification of impairment of technology related intangible assets of million from operating expense to cost of revenue expense for the year ended december  included in the gross profit for products for is a million charge for inventory write down related to discontinued product designs and for product quality warranty obligation expenses 
the increase in total gross margin for as compared to  was primarily attributable to the decrease of million in amortization of technology related intangible assets expense and the decrease of million in impairment of technology related intangible assets for as compared to these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in the provision of warranty expense in as compared to we believe the increase in gross margin for products in as compared to  after excluding the items mentioned above  can be attributed  in part  to the increase in our software revenue 
our software products have higher gross margins than our other product types  and an increase in software revenue would cause our gross margin from products to increase 
the increase in total gross margin 
table of contents in was also attributable to our efforts to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  combined with an increase in total revenue 
the increase in gross profit from maintenance and professional services in as compared to  was primarily attributable to increased maintenance revenue achieved on decreased customer support costs 
customer support costs decreased due to cost reduction programs implemented over the past two years 
we expect to maintain total gross margins of between and for research and development total research and development expenses decreased in to million from million in  and represented of total revenue for for as compared to  the decrease in research and development expenses of million was primarily due to the decrease in overhead expenses of approximately million offset by the increase in payroll and consulting expenses of approximately million associated with our continued allocation of resources towards investing in our future product offerings

for as compared to  approximately million of the decrease in marketing and selling expenses was from decreased overhead costs associated with cost reduction measures  approximately million of the decrease was from decreased spending on marketing programs  and approximately million of the decrease was from a reduction in bad debt expense 
these reductions were partially offset by approximately million of increased commission expense due to increased revenue 
we believe total marketing and selling expenditures will be between and of total revenue in general and administrative total general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in  and represented of total revenue for for as compared to  approximately million of the increase was from increased payroll and overhead costs associated with an increased workforce and increased bonus payouts  and approximately million of the increase for professional fees incurred in connection with on going litigation

one escrow agreement put million of the purchase price into an escrow fund 
we received million from this securant escrow fund during the year ended december  in final settlement of outstanding escrow fund claims  which resulted in a decrease to goodwill of million 
the remainder of the escrow fund was released to the selling shareholders during march the second escrow agreement put million of the securant purchase price into an escrow fund

 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  we reclassified in place workforce related intangible assets into goodwill  resulting in an increase to goodwill and a decrease to intangible assets of million 
in addition  upon reclassification of in place workforce related intangible assets to goodwill and determination of indefinite lived assets  we reversed the deferred tax liabilities related to these intangible assets 
the reversal of deferred tax liabilities resulted in a decrease to goodwill and deferred tax liabilities of million 
in  we paid million to xcert stockholders upon finalization of the working capital calculation 
the costs of the working capital adjustment has been added to the purchase price of xcert and resulted in an increase to goodwill of million during we incurred litigation expenses in connection with a patent litigation relating to the products acquired in the may acquisition of gi and recorded these expenses as related costs of acquisition 
the costs to defend the gi lawsuit were covered by the escrow fund set aside from the gi purchase price 
the costs of litigation and disbursements from the gi escrow resulted in a net increase to goodwill of million during the amounts allocated to in process research and development ipr d projects were expensed in the quarter that the related acquisition was consummated because technological feasibility of the ipr d projects had not been achieved and there were no

restructurings during and  we evaluated and initiated restructuring actions in order to consolidate some of our operations  enhance operational efficiency and reduce expenses 
these actions resulted in total restructuring charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we continue to monitor and assess our facility obligations  real estate markets and our operating expenses 
as a result of these ongoing assessments  during we revised estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
these revisions resulted in no net change to our restructuring liability at december  we revised estimates of facility exit charges based upon the terms of finalized subleases obtained during  due to lower than anticipated operating costs and other direct costs associated with certain exited facilities  and due to revisions in anticipated headcount growth 
these revised estimates of excess facility costs resulted in a net increase to facility exit costs of million at december  in addition  we reduced our severance restructuring reserve by million at december  when we determined our remaining severance and other outplacement costs were lower than originally estimated 
we also reduced our restructuring reserve of costs associated with the liquidation of our swedish development operations and the sale of certain swedish assets by million at december  when we determined we had no legal and consulting costs remaining in connection with this transaction

the restructuring charges include costs of million incurred due to the revision of previously recorded restructuring charges 
included in the restructuring charges are costs of million consisting of facility exit costs and related impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
facility exit costs consist of estimated shortfalls of sublease rental income compared to obligations due under certain exited facilities leases which are payable through the remaining unreserved lease obligations related to certain exited facilities amount to million  which represents our estimated sublease income from these facilities from the end of the reserve period to the end of the lease term 
impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures included in facility exit costs are for unamortized leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures that we believe will not be recoverable upon sublease of exited facilities 
total facility exit costs for include costs of million we incurred when we revised estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges 
we revised the estimates included in facility exit costs due to the extension of the period of time estimated to obtain sublease tenants for certain exited facilities  based on the terms of finalized subleases obtained during  due to higher than anticipated operating costs associated with certain exited facilities  and due to the continued uncertainty and deterioration in the commercial real estate and sublet markets in the boston metropolitan area 
we recorded restructuring charges of million during associated with the liquidation of our swedish development operations and the sale of certain swedish assets and the business related to the assets to tfs

the following tables set forth the amount  percentage of total revenue and percentage increase decrease of revenue by regional area years ended december  percentage increase in millions revenue percentage revenue percentage decrease united states of america europe and other asia pacific total we believe the decrease in total revenue in as compared to was primarily due to the continued decline in information technology spending by our existing and prospective customers due to the uncertainty of the economy

authenticator units sold  in thousands of units  were as follows percentage decrease number of authenticator units sold average selling price 
table of contents we believe revenue from sales of rsa securid authenticators declined in as compared to primarily due to the recent and continued downsizing of businesses 
the decrease in number of units sold  along with the decrease in the average selling price in as compared to  contributed to the decreased revenue from our rsa securid authentication product line 
the decrease in the average selling price can be attributed to an increase in the number of larger volume transactions during as compared to  because we tend to give larger discounts on larger volume transactions 
our authentication products revenue includes revenue from our rsa keon product line for all periods presented 
rsa keon revenue decreased in as compared to  which we believe was due primarily to our customers delaying or canceling the implementation of large infrastructure information technology projects 
in addition  during we eliminated several products included in the rsa keon product line  and this contributed to the decrease in revenue from our rsa keon product line 
as a result of our acquisition of securant in september  we established the rsa cleartrust web access management solution product line  and generated million of web access management revenue in the fourth quarter of web access management revenue was million and accounted for of total revenue for we believe that the decrease in developer solutions and encryption revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of technology companies funding development and in the development of new information technology products  as well as the availability of free  open source products that compete with our rsa bsafe product line 
we believe the increase in service revenue in as compared to can primarily be attributed to continued purchases by new customers coupled with renewals of annual maintenance contracts from sale of products in prior periods

these prepaid royalties were expensed to cost of product revenue when it was determined that they may not have future realizable value as a result of our acquisition of xcert in february we believe the decrease in gross margin for products for as compared to  after excluding the items mentioned above  was primarily attributable to the decrease in our software revenue 
our software products have higher gross margins than our other product types  and a decrease in software revenue would cause our gross margin for products to decrease 
we believe the increase in gross profit from maintenance and professional services in as compared to was primarily attributable to increased maintenance revenue achieved on decreased customer support costs

we revised the estimates included in facility exit costs due to the extension of the period of time estimated to obtain sublease tenants for certain exited facilities  based on the terms of finalized subleases obtained during  due to higher than anticipated operating costs associated with certain exited facilities  and due to the continued uncertainty and deterioration in the commercial real estate and sublet markets in the boston metropolitan area

at any time and at their option  each holder may convert any outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
conversion of all of the outstanding debentures would result in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
we can redeem all or a portion of the convertible debentures for cash at any time after october   as long as the arithmetic average of the weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day during the fifteen trading day period immediately prior to the election to redeem is of the conversion price 
this redemption feature was not exercisable at december  the debentures are unsecured and are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
the agreements governing the convertible debentures contain covenants restricting our ability to incur and guarantee additional debt 
the covenants limit the amount of additional debt we may incur to the lesser of of our consolidated stockholders equity  which was approximately million at december   or a total of million including the balance of the convertible debentures outstanding 
any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and accounts receivable days outstanding calculated as net accounts receivable divided by revenue per day will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and accounts receivable days outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as the amount of international sales and length of customer s payment cycle 
we also record deferred maintenance billings as accounts receivable  and the timing of these billings affects the 
table of contents accounts receivable days outstanding 
historically  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers 
an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our accounts receivable days outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
due to the current economic climate  we may observe an increase in the length of our customers payment cycle 
to address increases in accounts receivable balance and to improve cash flow  we may from time to time take actions to encourage earlier payment of receivables 
discounts offered to customers to encourage payment are deducted from revenue 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we may incur increased bad debt expense and increased estimates for reserves against revenue and will be subject to greater general credit risks

our plans for future uses of cash may include additional acquisitions of other entities or technologies  retirement of outstanding debt and additional purchases of property and equipment 
we anticipate capital expenditures will be primarily for purchases of property and equipment and will aggregate approximately million to million for we expect to fund our capital expenditures from cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we believe that cash generated from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  including our restructuring liabilities  through at least the next twelve months 
however  because of our concern that the current economic conditions may persist during  if not longer  we have taken and continue to take steps to reduce our expenses and align our cost structure to our revenue

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results our operating results tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  can cause these fluctuations  including  among others the size  timing and shipment of individual orders for our products  changes in our operating expenses  the timing of the introduction or enhancement of our products and our competitors products  customers deferring their orders in anticipation of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products  changes in the mix of products sold  changes in product pricing  including changes in competitors pricing policies  development and performance of our direct and indirect distribution channels and changes in the mix of vertical markets to which we sell our products  the amount and timing of charges relating to the impairment or loss of value of some of our assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  the timing of personnel departures and new hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  and general economic conditions 
we may not be able to achieve  sustain or grow our profitability from quarter to quarter 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed  a small variation in when revenue is recognized can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
our business has historically tended to be seasonal  with the last quarter of the year having the highest amount of revenue and the first quarter of the year having the lowest amount of revenue 
if the global economy remains weak  then we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
the global economy  especially the technology sector  is still weak and may recover slowly or not at all during the foreseeable future 
the general economic slowdown has had and may continue to have serious negative consequences for our business and operating results 
we believe that the economic slowdown is causing some current or potential customers to defer purchases  to go out of business or to have insufficient capital to buy or pay for our products 
in response to the current economic conditions  many companies have reduced their budgets for information technology products and services  which could reduce or eliminate some potential sales of our products and services 
in addition  some of our resellers and distributors are experiencing financial difficulties due to the weak economy  which affects our ability to sell to and collect money from those resellers and distributors 
if we cannot sublease our excess facilities  then we will have to continue to make lease payments for these facilities until the leases expire 
we currently lease a number of excess  unused or under used facilities that we are trying to sublet  and some of our lease commitments for these facilities will not expire for several years 
the real estate market  especially the real estate market in the boston metropolitan area where our headquarters are located  is still weak  and we do not know when or whether we will be able to find sublessees for our excess facilities 
even if we do find sublessees  the monthly rent we receive from the sublessees will likely be significantly less than the monthly rent we owe to the landlord  which means that we will remain responsible for paying the difference 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
from january  through february  our stock price has ranged from a per share high of to a low of 
a number of factors may contribute to the volatility of our stock price  including our ability to meet the expectations of brokerage firms  industry analysts and investors with respect to our operating and financial results  our public announcements and our competitors public announcements  the public s perception of the strength of the e security solutions market and technology companies generally  litigation developments  the volatility of the stock market in general and of the technology sector in particular  and general economic conditions 
if the market for e security solutions does not continue to grow  then demand for our products may decrease 
the market for some of our e security solutions is continuing to develop  and demand for our products depends on  among other things the perceived ability of our products to address real customer problems  the perceived quality  price  availability and interoperability of our products as compared to our competitors products  
table of contents the market s perception of how easy or difficult it is to deploy our products  especially in complex  heterogeneous network environments  the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  market acceptance and use of digital signatures and digital certificates in business applications  the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the public s perception of the need for secure electronic commerce and communications over both wired and wireless computer networks  the us government s continued focus on e security as a means to counteract terrorism and other hostile acts  the pace of technological change and our ability to keep up with these changes  the market s perception of our products ability to address the e security aspects of privacy and security legislation  and general economic conditions  which  among other things  influence how much money our customers and potential customers are willing to allocate to their information technology budgets 
if we fail to keep up with changes in e security technology and standards  then our products could become obsolete 
the market for e security products is rapidly evolving 
e security technology is constantly changing as we and our competitors introduce new products and retire old ones and as customer requirements develop and change 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to introduce new  competitively priced products and solutions with features that meet changing customer requirements  all in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may not be successful in introducing new or enhanced products 
a number of factors  including the following  could have a negative impact on the success of our products quality  reliability or security failures  which could result in product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  unexpected service or warranty expenses  reduced orders and a decline in our competitive position  delays or difficulties in product development  our competitors introduction of new products ahead of our new products  or their introduction of superior or cheaper products  the availability of free  unpatented implementations of encryption algorithms and security protocols  the market s failure to accept new technologies  including smart cards and web access management  web services  digital certificate and public and private key management technologies  our failure to include features in our products  or obtain industry and governmental certifications  that our customers or us or foreign government regulators may require  our failure to anticipate changes in customers requirements  and the implementation of industry or government standards that are inconsistent with the technology embodied in our products 
we may need to purchase or license technology from third parties in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products 
we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology we need and  if we find such businesses  may not be able to purchase or license the technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
some of our products have long and unpredictable sales cycles  which may impact our quarterly operating results 
transactions for some of our products  especially our digital certificate management and web access management products  often involve large expenditures by our customers 
some of our customers may also need to invest substantial resources and modify their computer network infrastructures to take advantage of our products 
the sales cycles for these transactions are subject to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the need to educate potential customers about our products capabilities  customers willingness to make changes in their network infrastructures to take advantage of our products  the timing of customers budget cycles  and delays caused by customers internal review processes 
in addition  we are currently working on increasing our sales to the united states federal government 
federal regulatory  approval and purchasing requirements can greatly lengthen the sales cycle for sales to the federal government 
if we fail to obtain a sufficient supply of high quality rsa securid authenticators or components  then we may be unable to fill customer orders or may need to replace defective authenticators shipped to our customers 
problems with the availability or quality of our products could cause our revenue to decrease and our costs to increase  damage our reputation in the marketplace and subject us to damage claims from our customers 
examples of quality and possible availability problems include 
table of contents in and  our quarterly analysis of historical failure and defective return rates indicated that certain authenticators produced between and were subject to higher defect and failure rates 
many of our suppliers are located outside of the united states 
if political  economic or health related events  such as the us actions in iraq or a major health crisis like the sars epidemic in  were to affect international trade  then we could experience difficulties in obtaining product components from our international suppliers 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our product components 
if our existing suppliers were unable to provide us with a sufficient supply of quality components  then we would have to expend significant resources to find new suppliers  and it is possible that we would be unable to find new suppliers in a timely manner 
if we fail to remain competitive  then we could lose market share for our established products or fail to gain market share for our less mature products 
a number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell our products at lower prices or at reduced margins  including  among others some of our competitors offer e security products with features and functionality that our products do not currently offer 
some computer and software companies that have not traditionally offered e security products are now offering free or low cost e security products and functionality bundled with their own computer and software products 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we do  allowing them to leverage an installed customer base  adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
the expiration of some of our patents has permitted the use and distribution of freeware  free versions of some of our technology  and we believe that some potential customers may be choosing to use freeware instead of buying our products 
many companies have reduced their information technology budgets due to the current economic conditions  which could make competition more intense because we are competing for fewer customer dollars 
international sales make up a significant portion of our business 
international sales accounted for more than of our total revenue in each of the years ended december   and we may need to tailor or localize our products in order to compete in particular international markets and to comply with foreign laws 
we may not be able to develop  market and distribute localized versions of our products in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  including foreign regulatory requirements and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  legal uncertainty regarding liability and the costs of resolving or litigating a dispute internationally  difficulties in the enforcement of intellectual property rights  export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products incorporating that technology  difficulties and delays in establishing international distribution channels  difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  tariffs and other trade barriers  and political instability 
if we fail to protect our rights in our proprietary technology  competitors may use our technology  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  software licenses  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we also generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  distributors and strategic partners as well as with our customers and potential customers seeking proprietary information  and limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized third parties may nonetheless succeed at copying aspects of our products  obtaining and using information that we regard as proprietary  or infringing upon our patents and other proprietary rights 
we rely on patents to protect our proprietary rights in our technology  but patents may not provide complete protection it is possible that any patent that we or our licensors hold might be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or terminated 
it is possible that patent examiners might reject the claims described in our pending or future patent applications 

table of contents the laws of some countries in which our products are now  or may in the future be  developed or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
during the life of a patent  third parties may design and sell work around solutions that accomplish the goals of our patented inventions but do not infringe the patents themselves 
our issued us patents expire at various dates ranging from to when each of our patents expires  competitors may develop and sell products based on the same or similar technologies as those covered by the expired patent  which could result in lower prices  reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance 
in addition  when each of our patents expires  potential customers may choose to rely on freeware  free versions of our previously patented technology  rather than buying our products 
we have registered  or are seeking to register  our trademarks and service marks in most countries where we sell our products 
however  from time to time third parties oppose our pending trademark and service mark applications 
furthermore  some national trademark offices may not permit us to register the marks on terms that we find acceptable 
we will seek to enforce our trademark and service mark rights against third parties who are marketing goods or services under marks that we consider confusingly similar to our marks 
however  there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any enforcement action 
we may also seek to purchase or license trademarks from third parties  but we may not be able to purchase or license trademarks on commercially favorable terms or at all 
the technology industry is highly litigious 
from time to time  we have been involved in disputes with third parties who allege that our products may infringe intellectual property rights held by the third parties 
any litigation carries a number of significant risks  including litigation is often very expensive  even if it is resolved in our favor  and litigation diverts the attention of management and other resources 
moreover  if a court or other government agency rules against us in any intellectual property litigation  we might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses to the infringing technology  or pay significant monetary damages 
we must establish and maintain strategic relationships 
we need to create relationships with third parties  including some of our competitors  to ensure that our products will interoperate with the third parties products 
if our products do not work with third party products used by our customers and potential customers  then our products could lose or fail to achieve market acceptance 
in addition  one of our business strategies is to enter into strategic marketing alliances or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger customer population than we could reach alone through our direct sales and marketing efforts 
if we cannot create relationships with strategic partners  then we will need to devote more resources to sales and marketing 
we may not be able to find appropriate strategic partners or may not be able to enter into relationships on commercially favorable terms 
furthermore  the relationships we do enter into may not be successful 
because our strategic relationships are generally non exclusive  our strategic partners may decide to pursue alternative technologies or to develop alternative products in addition to or instead of our products  either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors 
security technologies are under constant attack 
the strength of our cryptographic and other e security technologies is constantly being tested by computer professionals  academics and hackers 
any significant advance in the techniques for attacking e security solutions could make some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable 
from time to time  we have learned of attempts by third parties to reverse engineer our products to find vulnerabilities 
if a third party successfully hacks any of our products and makes its findings public  then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the published vulnerabilities 
for example  if a third party were to hack our rsa securid solution  then some of our customers could require that we replace some or all of their rsa securid authenticators with authenticators that are more secure 
if we are required to make these replacements or if we cannot address the vulnerabilities in our products in a timely fashion  then our business and operating results could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our customers and potential customers could perceive our products as unreliable  making it more difficult for us to sell our products 

table of contents we may incur significant expenses and damages because of liability claims 
an actual or perceived breach of network or data security at our facilities or at a customer s facilities could result in a product liability claim against us 
a substantial product liability claim against us could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any actual or perceived breach of network or data security  whether or not caused by the failure of one of our products  could hurt our reputation and cause potential customers to turn to our competitors products 
we may need to make acquisitions to remain competitive 
from time to time  we may buy businesses  products and technologies that complement or augment our existing businesses  products and technologies 
acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the cost of potential transactions  competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to complete any given acquisition 
furthermore  in order to finance a potential acquisition  we may need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing money 
we may not be able to find financing on favorable terms  and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing stockholders 
our stockholder rights plan and some provisions of our charter may inhibit potential acquisition bids 
we have a classified board of directors and have also adopted a stockholders rights plan  both of which could make it more difficult for a potential acquiror to complete a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company 
while these provisions are intended to enable our board to maximize stockholder value  they may have the effect of discouraging takeovers that could be in the best interest of certain stockholders and may therefore have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock and preventing changes in our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in the market value of our investments  our common stock and foreign exchange rates 
market fluctuations could impact our results of operations and consolidated financial condition 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
we generally purchase our marketable securities and cash equivalent investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us treasury and government agency obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and money market investments with contractual maturities of one year or less 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable securities and cash equivalent investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
we evaluate the realizable value of these investments using qualitative and quantitative factors including discounted cash flow analysis and liquidation value assessments 
at december  crosby finance  llc  a qualified special purpose entity of which we are a member  held approximately million shares of verisign common stock and a variable delivery forward contract  or vdf 
the vdf contract held by crosby will settle in january the vdf contract entitles us to additional cash proceeds of up to million depending on the market price of verisign common stock on january   as follows market price of verisign common stock on january  proceeds to to to million over million we account for our investment in crosby under eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and balance sheet classification of structured notes 
we are carrying our interest at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in income from investing activities in the statement of operations 
we determine the fair value based on the fair value of crosby s right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds under the vdf 
the closing price of verisign s common stock on the nasdaq national market on december  was per share 
unless the verisign stock appreciates to at least per share in january  we will not be entitled to any cash flows from our remaining interest in crosby 
our remaining investment in crosby has a fair value of million at december   and is recorded in other assets 
should the value of our investment in crosby decrease  we would incur a pretax charge of up to million  which would be included in income from investing activities in the statement of operations 
during  we issued convertible subordinated debentures due october  with an aggregate principal amount of million  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock 
at any time and at 
table of contents their option  each holder may convert any outstanding debentures into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which upon conversion of all of the outstanding debentures would result in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the holders of the warrants issued with the debentures may exercise the warrants at any time until october  at an exercise price of per share 
the conversion price of the debentures and the exercise price of the warrants may be adjusted under certain circumstances  such as events that would cause dilution of the holder s interest 
we may redeem all or a portion of the debentures for cash at any time after october  as long as the arithmetic average of the weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day during the fifteen trading day period immediately prior to the election to redeem is at least of the conversion price 
the redemption feature was not exercisable at december  if the convertible debentures are redeemed in part or total prior to their maturity date we will record a non cash charge for unamortized deferred financing costs and the unamortized value of the warrants 
at december   unamortized deferred financing costs were million and the unamortized value of the warrants was million 
interest is payable in cash semi annually at a fixed rate of per annum  and therefore we believe we have no interest rate exposure with these debentures 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to sales and operating expenses denominated in local currencies 
our direct sales to our customers in countries outside of the united states are denominated in us dollars and local currencies  with the majority of our direct sales denominated in us dollars 
our sales through indirect distribution channels are generally denominated in us dollars 
for countries outside the united states  we generally pay our operating expenses in local currency 
when we do invoice customers in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time of invoice until collection occurs 
we are also exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations between the time we collect in us dollars and the time we pay our operating expenses in local currency 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect the profitability and cash flows in us dollars of our products sold in international markets
