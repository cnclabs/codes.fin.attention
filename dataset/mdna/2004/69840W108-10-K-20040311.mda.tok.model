impact of inflation in the past  the company has been able to recover inflationary cost and commodity price increases through increased menu prices 
there have been  and there may be in the future  delays in implementing such menu price increases  and competitive pressures may limit the company s ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety

a majority of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
although the company has and will continue to attempt to pass along any increased labor costs through food price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increased labor costs can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by consumers without diminishing to some degree consumer spending
