we are the only national chain offering automotive service  accessories  tires and parts under one roof  positioning us to achieve our goal of becoming the category dominant one stop shop for automotive maintenance and accessories 
of our stores  are what we call supercenters  which feature an average of state of the art service bays  with an average of more than  square feet per supercenter 
our store size allows us to display and sell a more complete offering of merchandise in a wider array of categories than our competitors  with a focus on the high growth accessories segment and a comprehensive tire offering 
we leverage this investment in inventory through our ability to install what we sell in our service bays and by offering this merchandise to both commercial and retail customers 
we have a new leadership team of experienced retailers in place 
this team has come together over the last year and combines new hires and tenured executives with automotive aftermarket  big box retail and proven business building experience 
we have successfully implemented the final phase of our profit enhancement plan pep that we launched in late and are continuing to focus upon improving the performance of our existing stores in order to provide a solid base for growth and expansion in the billion car and light truck automotive aftermarket 
we had total revenues of billion and operating profit of million in fiscal during  we were able to reduce our total debt and increase our cash and cash equivalents by million and million  respectively 
this was accomplished by continued improvement in our inventory to accounts payable ratio  which resulted in net cash provided by operating activities of million  a improvement over the prior year

focusing our service offering and introducing name brand tires 
we continue to build upon the competitive advantage that our service offering provides over our parts only competitors by sharpening our focus on the most profitable maintenance services and introducing name brand tires 
by narrowing our service offering  we believe that we can improve our financial performance  both by eliminating less profitable heavy repair services and by better managing the skills of our staff
