item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  which appear later in this report 
introduction as discussed in part i of this report  our business continues to undergo substantial change 
because we expect our business to change during  we do not expect our historical financial results to be indicative of our future results 
for example  if we reach an agreement to sell an additional portion of our business  the financial results of the business to be sold will be reported as discontinued operations 
as required by gaap  to ensure period to period comparability  we also will restate our prior period results to reflect this reclassification of that business as discontinued operations 
if we begin or acquire any new or additional businesses  our results from continuing operations will be affected 
our financial condition also may change significantly as we implement additional strategic options we may spend cash  incur additional debt or issue additional shares of our stock to finance acquisitions or to implement new business strategies  if we sell assets or businesses  we would expect to receive cash as a result of those sales  we may be required to repay all or a portion of the million of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes before their march maturity  which would reduce our cash on hand  and changes to our operations will alter our organization and our financial results 
because we have not yet finalized a comprehensive business strategy for the future  we cannot forecast how our operating results or our financial condition may change  as compared to prior years 
historical results results of continuing operations 
in reviewing the discussion and analysis of the results of operations of our continuing operations that follows  you should consider the following our revenue comes from three sources payments from our subscribers for the wireless services we provide  payments for licensing or selling software to our customers that they need to use our services  together with related payments for maintenance  support  training  and consulting services  and payments for hardware needed to use our services  which we sell or lease to our customers 
to generate that revenue  we incur various direct costs  which we report as our cost of revenue 
these costs include primarily the amounts we pay to purchase airtime  software  and hardware that we resell  license  or lease to our customers  and certain personnel expenses for employees who provide specific services to our customers or develop products that we sell or license such as engineers 
we exclude certain costs of customer fulfillment and customer care from our cost of revenue and report these costs as operating expenses 
our gross profit is the difference between our revenue and the cost of our revenue 
our gross margin is the percentage of our revenue that is left as gross profit  after deducting the cost of our revenue 
the other costs of operating our business are our operating and our non operating expenses 
most of these expenses require us to spend cash to pay them 
these include salaries  bonuses and benefits for our employees  rental payments for our offices  legal  accounting and other professional fees and expenses  and other similar costs required to operate our businesses we also report our non operating income 
principally  this is interest income from our cash balances and our investments in united states government agency sponsored securities 
our critical accounting policies  which we discuss below  affect the amount of revenue and expense we record in each period 
in applying these critical accounting policies to the results of our business operations  we must make judgments that  if made differently  would have a positive or negative effect on our financial results 
we believe that our judgments are both reasonable and appropriate  in light of the relevant accounting rules 
as a result of acquisitions  dispositions and restructuring activities  our business has changed significantly from year to year 
in addition  in certain periods we have been required to take significant charges to reflect declines in the value of our investments in other businesses and the value of some of our business assets 
as a result  our financial results have changed significantly from one year to the next and can sometimes be difficult to compare 
we discuss the factors that affect comparability in more detail below 
financial condition 
in reviewing the discussion and analysis of the financial condition of our continuing operations that follows  you should consider the following our business has never generated a profit 
consequently  we have required funding from sources other than our business operations to run our business 
this funding has come principally from selling securities 
in october  we completed our initial public offering  in which we sold stock and received net proceeds for us of million after paying underwriting discounts  commissions and other expenses of the offering 
in march  we completed an additional sale of our stock that generated net proceeds for us of approximately billion 
in  we sold million of our convertible subordinated notes due notes and received net proceeds of million 
we have not borrowed money from banks  and we currently do not have any agreements with banks that would allow us to borrow money 
in  and  we used cash from our sales of stock and our convertible subordinated notes  and we also issued additional shares of stock  to pay for the purchase of assets and businesses that allowed us to significantly expand the products and the services we offered in all of our segments 
we also used cash to fund our operating losses and to repurchase approximately of the notes at a discount during and we now have cash balances and liquid investments including our investments in united states government agency sponsored securities of approximately million excluding restricted cash  and we have million of outstanding notes  which we will be required to repay on march  we also have various other obligations that we are required to pay over time under various contracts and agreements  as discussed in more detail below 
since our inception in  we have accumulated substantial net operating losses that would be a valuable asset if we become profitable in the future and start to generate income that would be subject to income tax 
under federal and state tax laws  we are permitted to use these losses to reduce the income taxes we otherwise would have to pay on future income 
as a result  we could have little or no income tax liability for a period of time 
we have accumulated federal net operating losses totaling approximately million that we can carry forward as potential tax deductions until they expire between and in addition  we have incurred capital losses of approximately million that we can carry forward as potential tax deductions but only against capital gains until they expire between and our ability to realize value from these accumulated losses  in the form of lower future income taxes  may be limited by applicable tax rules  and we will only be able to realize value from the accumulated losses if we become profitable 
see the discussion under the heading risk factors below for more information on the risks associated with the use of these accumulated losses 
impact of restructuring in late  a precipitous drop in the price of technology stocks  slow market adoption of wireless technology and a generally poor economic environment  began to have a negative effect on mobile data businesses like ours 
among other things  businesses reduced their spending on technology and capital equipment 
this slowed the growth of our revenue and ultimately contributed to declines in our revenue 
in response  we focused on managing costs and streamlining our operations to reduce expenses and lower our losses 
we undertook this strategy to reduce our use of cash to fund our operations and in an effort to achieve profits more quickly 
although we have achieved significant cost savings  we have not yet achieved profitability 
our losses have declined  but our revenue has also declined  and our business continues to consume cash 
we believe that the disruptive impact of the restructuring process had a negative effect on our revenue  as employees were distracted from their jobs and as reductions in staff required remaining employees to assume new and different responsibilities 
in addition  we believe that the strategic evaluation process that we have undertaken  which has resulted in the sale of our largest business and has involved an exploration of other potential divestitures  possible acquisitions and other possible significant changes to our business  also has led to some distraction from normal business operations and has negatively effected our efforts to attract new customers and increase revenue 
in the near term  it also has resulted in some additional expenses for legal and other professional fees 
we do not expect to be able to achieve profitability through further cost reductions 
also  we likely will incur some additional expenses in the future at least periodically to complete the strategic process that we are pursuing 
other notable items transportation in  the transportation segment began providing services to us xpress enterprises  inc  its largest contract to date 
in six of the top fifty trucking companies in the united states expressed interest in potentially becoming customers of our transportation segment 
as our transportation segment continues to increase its market share  the possibility exists that a larger competitor may seek to compete more vigorously for our potential and existing customers 
to the extent that a competitor is successful in limiting our access to future customers and or winning over our current customers  our business could be negatively impacted 
our mobilemax units have experienced warranty issues requiring repairs  which have contributed to a decline in gross profit and gross margin in our transportation segment 
although we have taken action to address these issues  we cannot be certain that we will not experience similar problems in the future 
as of december   we have reserved  for potential future warranty claims 
mobile government in  the mobile government segment began service under its contract with hamilton county  ohio to provide the hamilton county sheriff s office and other agencies within hamilton county with packetcluster patrol and packetwriter 
factors affecting comparability our results of operations in  and have been affected by acquisitions  investments  impairment charges  and restructuring charges 
the factors identified below have had a significant impact on our operations and should be considered in comparing our results of operations in to those in and in comparing our results of operations in to those in as discussed above  we expect additional changes in our business in  which will further affect our results and may make period to period comparisons more difficult 
acquisitions from september through december  we acquired businesses for aggregate stock and cash consideration in excess of billion 
our acquisitions have increased our operating revenues and expenses from the date of acquisition 
in the discussion of our results below  we quantify the effects of acquisitions on our revenues and expenses 
generally  acquisitions also increased our depreciation and amortization expense as we amortized the value of acquired assets 
however during each of and  we significantly wrote down the value of certain of the intangible assets that we had acquired 
as a result  our amortization expenses have decreased significantly since also  we adopted sfas no 
on january   which further affected our amortization expenses 
sfas no 
required that we cease amortizing goodwill  thus reducing our amortization expense in see the discussion under the heading impairment charges below for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
investments we made numerous investments through aether capital  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  to promote the development of new technologies that are compatible with the services we offer or that we may wish to integrate into our services 
from august  we invested approximately million in companies 
we recorded significant impairment charges and reductions in the value of our investments during and overall  we have written down the carrying value of our remaining six investments to fair value  which was approximately million as of december  see the discussion under the heading impairment charges investments below for a more detailed discussion of the charges related to these investments 
impairment charges acquisitions sfas no 
impairments 
through december   we recorded approximately million in goodwill and other intangibles in continuing operations related to our acquisitions and billion in goodwill and other intangible assets relating to our discontinued operations 
during  we performed on going analysis of the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles and the value of our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
based on quantitative and qualitative measures  we assessed the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators were present 
based on a variety of indicators  we determined during that the goodwill and other intangibles from our acquisitions may have become impaired 
as a result of our review  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to our acquisitions were not fully recoverable 
accordingly  during  we recorded impairment charges in continuing operations of approximately million  which represents the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
also during  we recorded impairment charges in discontinued operations of approximately billion  which represents the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
goodwill 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
instead  they are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded an impairment charge of million related to continuing operations in  which was recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
of this charge  million and million was in our mobile government and transportation segments  respectively 
an additional million was recorded as an impairment charge with respect to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
also requires that we repeat the two step impairment analysis each year  beginning with a recurring annual measurement date chosen by us in we chose september  to be s measurement date  and we will continue to perform annual impairment reviews as of september th each subsequent year 
the september  review resulted in an additional impairment charge of million related to continuing operations  which was recorded as impairment of intangibles and other assets in our consolidated statements of operations 
of this charge  million and million was in our mobile government and transportation segments  respectively 
an additional million was recorded as an impairment charge with respect to discontinued operations 
we performed this analysis again in september with the help of a third party appraiser and determined that there was no further impairment of goodwill at that time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
intangibles and other long lived assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale  and broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  during and  we assessed the fair value of certain of our long lived assets  including software  computer equipment  other tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
this assessment resulted in impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
these charges are recorded in impairment of intangibles and other assets in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
investments as discussed above  from through  we made approximately million of investments in other businesses 
during  we recorded a net charge of million  which included million in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of the net charge related to net gains and losses from the sales of investments  and changes in the fair value of warrants 
during  we recorded a net charge of million  which included million in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of the charge related to net gains and losses from the sales of investments  and changes in the fair value of warrants 
during  we recorded a net gain of  which included  in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of our charge related to the net gain from sales of investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
restructuring charges see the section under the heading restructuring in the discussion of critical accounting policies below for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating the valuation allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  estimating the realizable value of our inventory  valuation of long lived intangible assets and goodwill  and restructuring accruals revenue recognition as discussed above  we derive our revenue from three sources subscriber revenue  software and related services  and device sales 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue might have differed materially from that reported 
we might report more or less revenue in any particular period  if we made judgments that led us to accelerate or defer the recognition of various parts of our revenue  as compared to the judgments we currently make 
we believe that our current judgments and estimates are reasonable  appropriate for our businesses and consistent with current accounting rules 
subscriber revenue we derive subscriber revenue from the provision of comprehensive business solutions designed to meet the mobile management needs of truckload  less than truckload and private carriers 
for all sales  we obtain signed binding contracts with our subscribers 
contracts are generally for a three to five year period and include a termination penalty if cancelled by the subscriber before the term of the contract expires 
these contracts are generally renewable at the option of the subscriber for additional periods or otherwise continue on a monthly basis until cancelled by the subscriber 
subscriber revenue is recognized monthly as the service is provided 
activation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer relationship 
software and related services revenue software and related services revenues are generated from licensing software and providing services  including maintenance and technical support  training and consulting 
software revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products 
we recognize the revenue when the license agreement is signed  the license fee is fixed and determinable  delivery of the software has occurred  and when we estimate that the collectibility of the fees is probable 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment term  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time it becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if we assessed collectibility differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
revenue from licensing software that requires significant customization and modification is recognized using the percentage of completion method  based on the hours incurred in relation to the total estimated hours 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates of the total amount of work we expect to be required to customize or modify the software  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  and our margins on the project in the reporting period  may differ materially from amounts reported 
service revenues consist principally of maintenance and technical support  which consists of unspecified when and if available product updates and customer telephone support services and are recognized ratably over the term of the service period 
if we allocated more or less value to these when and if deliverables  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
other service revenues are recognized as the related services are provided 
device revenue we derive device revenue from the sale of wireless devices used to provide our services 
we have assessed the interoperability of the types of hardware that we sell  and when customers can obtain similar equipment from other parties to receive services we offer  or customers can use equipment purchased from us with services provided by other service providers  we recognize equipment revenue  including the related shipping  installation and activation services  when collectibility is probable and the equipment and related services are provided to the customer 
when the equipment is not deemed to be interoperable ie  it can only be used by a customer to acquire our services  the equipment revenue  including the related shipping and activation fees  and related costs are deferred and recognized over the shorter of the life of the equipment or the estimated term of the subscriber 
in these situations  we allocate amounts to the device and subscriber categories based on the relative fair values 
when we sell hardware and software  and the hardware is considered essential to the functionality of the software  we account for the two elements as one unit of accounting 
in reporting revenues  we allocate amounts between software and device revenue based on their relative fair values 
revenue from multiple element arrangements for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method 
this means that we defer revenue from the total fees associated with the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the element s of the arrangement that has have not yet been delivered 
the fair values of any undelivered elements are established by using historical evidence specific to aether 
for instance  the fair values for maintenance and technical support is based on separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon the renewal rates quoted in the contracts and the fair value of services  such as training  is based on separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
if we allocated the respective fair values of the elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential product returns and the valuation of our accounts receivable 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
during  we recorded provisions for sales returns for continuing operations of  which reduced revenue 
during  we recorded a reduction in the provision for sales returns of  which increased revenue 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as a result  we recorded bad debt expense for continuing operations of million and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   our net accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts of million 
bad debt expense is included in selling and marketing expense 
if we had used different estimates and assumptions related to the amount of sales returns we would receive  and about the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our provisions for sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts may have differed materially from that reported valuation of inventory inventory  net of allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory  consists of finished goods such as mobilemax units  network hardware and accessories and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a standard costing method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
there are a limited number of suppliers of our inventory  which could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet potential future increases in customer demand for our products 
valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets and goodwill during  we recorded significant impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
these charges are described in detail under the heading impairment charges  which appears above 
in  we recorded significant impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions pursuant to our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets including our annual impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see the discussion under the heading impairment charges acquisitions for a more detailed discussion of these subjects 
restructuring as discussed above  during through  we implemented expense reduction plans as part of our integration strategy focused on improving operational efficiencies and the implementation of other measures in order to reduce planned expenses 
these efforts have resulted in the consolidation of excess facilities and a significant reduction in our workforce 
employee separation benefits under the restructuring plans include severance  medical  and other benefits 
facility closure costs and other costs included expected losses on subleases  brokerage commissions  asset impairment charges  contract termination costs and other costs 
continuing operations charge adjustments total positions eliminated facilities closed or consolidated discontinued operations charge adjustments total positions eliminated facilities closed or consolidated as of december   the accrued liability related to all restructuring activities was million  the majority of which related to outstanding lease obligations that will be substantially paid off during calculation of the restructuring accrual related to facilities requires us to make estimates concerning our ability to sublease the properties involved  including the expected length of time it will take us to sublease the facility  the expected rental rates on subleases  and estimated brokerage expenses associated with executing the sublease 
we used the assistance of independent real estate brokerage firms in making these estimates  and our estimates may be impacted by future economic trends 
the expected losses on subleases have not been discounted 
if we had made different estimates of our expected restructuring costs  our restructuring charges might have been higher or lower 
to the extent actual charges differ from the accrual that results from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring accrual  and may also have to record additional charges on our consolidated statement of operations 
we do not expect that actual results with respect to the items covered by the remaining  small restructuring accrual  will differ materially from the amount of the accrual which we developed based on estimates 
results of continuing operations in this section  when we discuss the results of our operations  we will be talking about our mobile government and transportation segments  which we refer to as continuing operations 
from to  our results were significantly affected by the track transaction in march excluding the effect of this acquisition  revenue would have decreased slightly from  although gross profit would have still increased 
during this period  we also began to see the impact on our expenses of our restructuring activities  which we began in our operating expenses declined significantly  although we recorded a large restructuring charge in and also recorded substantial impairment charges relating to our operating assets and our investments in other businesses  as a slowdown in the economy and in the mobile data business generally negatively affected our business and our investments 
these charges contributed to our significant net loss from continuing operations in our net loss from continuing operations improved significantly in for several reasons  particularly the track acquisition increased our revenue and gross profit  our restructuring program significantly reduced our operating expense  we had significantly smaller impairment charges relating to our assets and investments  losses from our investments in other businesses declined significantly  and we recorded a substantial gain from the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes due at a discount  which more than offset a large accounting charge that we recorded as a result of implementing a new accounting principle relating to how we value our assets 
see the discussion under the heading impairment charges acquisitions  which appears above  for a more detailed discussion of this subject 
from to  our business experienced a decline in revenue and a significant decline in both operating and non operating expenses 
with respect to operating expenses  we saw the benefits of our restructuring efforts 
our gross margin increased only slightly from to  and as a result our gross profit declined  reflecting the decline in revenue during this period 
our operating loss declined significantly  as a result of the substantial decline in our expenses  including significant declines in charges recorded to reflect impairments of our operating assets and our investments 
in and  the substantial gain we recorded as a result of our repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes due at a discount offset a portion of the impairment charges 
revenue mobile government transportation total subscriber software and related services hardware total mobile government the mobile government segment s revenue is derived primarily from software licensing fees and related services  including customization  installation  training  program management and maintenance 
the end users of these software systems are usually state or municipal law enforcement  fire and rescue and emergency medical services organizations 
on certain software projects  we may also provide network and other hardware as part of the solution 
mobile government revenue decreased million  or approximately  from to  reflecting declines in both hardware revenue and software and related services revenue  slightly offset by a  increase in subscriber revenue 
software and related services and hardware revenue declined primarily because we substantially completed two large projects in  and we did not have an increase in revenue from new projects in to offset the impact of these completions 
two projects  together accounted for approximately of revenue 
mobile government revenue increased  or approximately  from to increases in subscriber revenue and revenue from hardware sales were partially offset by a slight decline in revenue from software sales and related services 
although software and related services revenue was relatively flat year to year  the revenue stream was generally characterized by larger projects  including the pennsylvania state police and hamilton county  oh projects 
transportation the transportation segment s revenue is derived primarily from the provision of comprehensive business solutions designed to meet the mobile management needs of truckload  less than truckload and private carriers 
the revenue streams associated with providing these solutions are monthly service fees and the sale of hardware on which these solutions operate 
the hardware sales are deferred at the time of delivery and generally recognized over contract terms of three to five years 
transportation subscribers product mobilemax geologic hm trackware v total we acquired the hm subscribers in our acquisition of certain assets and licenses from track in at that time  our plan was to gradually convert as many of these subscribers as possible from that legacy system to our mobilemax product 
as expected in  we experienced a decrease in our hm subscribers as they migrated to our products as well as our competitors products 
the addition of the hm subscribers had a significant impact on our transportation segment 
the segment s revenue increased by million from to  primarily because of the new subscribers 
then  during  revenue decreased million  or approximately  primarily as a result of hm subscribers declining at a faster rate than mobilemax subscribers were added 
certain hm customers have not elected to convert to mobilemax 
those customers that do convert typically enter longer multi year contracts with lower monthly fees than they were paying for hm service 
the overall decline in revenue reflects this decline in subscriber revenue  partially offset by an increase in revenue from hardware sales which is a much smaller component of the transportation segment s total revenue 
while revenue from our mobilemax product continues to grow  both from the addition of new customers and the migration of hm customers to mobilemax  revenue growth from mobilemax and the other products and services our transportation segment sells has not been  and in the near term may not be  sufficient to offset the effect of the decline in revenue from hm customers 
during  subscriber revenue decreased million  or approximately  primarily due to decreased hm fees 
higher mobilemax subscriber revenue only partially offset this reduction in hm subscriber fees 
the mobilemax product generates a lower yet more consistent monthly fee 
during the same period  hardware revenue increased million  or approximately  primarily due to increased sales of the mobilemax product  including those customers converting from hm to mobilemax 
transportation deferred revenue primarily relates to hardware sales that are recognized evenly over the service life of the customer 
as of december  and  deferred transportation revenue was and million 
this growth in deferred revenue represents a source of future revenue 
gross profit and gross margin mobile government transportation total gross profit gross margin mobile government mobile government gross margin percentage increased from in to in primarily because hardware revenue which has a low margin became a much smaller proportion of the revenue mix 
gross margin percentage increased to in  primarily due to more effective tracking and management of the various project cost components of our business 
transportation our hm product has a higher gross margin than our mobilemax mobile messaging product  to which some of our hm customers are converting 
transportation gross margin percentage increased from in to in  primarily due to the addition of the hm subscribers  which carried a higher gross margin than our mobilemax subscribers 
gross margin percentage decreased to in due to a combination of the decrease in higher margin hm subscribers and an increase in the proportion of low margin hardware in the revenue mix 
additionally  increased warranty repair costs for our mobilemax products also contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage 
our mobilemax units have experienced warranty issues requiring repairs  which have contributed to a decline in gross profit and gross margin in our transportation segment 
although we have taken action to address the issues  we cannot be certain that we will not experience similar problems in the future 
as of december   we have reserved  for potential future repairs 
we believe we have the ability to sustain  and potentially increase  our subscriber gross margin percentage during due to the recent reductions in our satellite communications costs and realized efficiencies from our mobilemax product 
operating expenses our operating expenses declined significantly from to and to  primarily due to the results of our restructuring efforts  in which we streamlined our organization and reduced our workforce 
in addition  we have not continued to experience significant impairment charges on our intangible and other assets  after incurring significant impairment charges in and as discussed below  we do not expect our operating expenses to continue to decline at the same rate in the future 
operating expenses research and development exclusive of option and warrant expense general and administrative exclusive of option and warrant expense selling and marketing exclusive of option and warrant expense depreciation and amortization option and warrant expense impairment of intangibles and other assets restructuring charge loss on disposal of assets total operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of cash compensation and related costs for engineers engaged in research and development activities and  to a lesser extent  costs of materials relating to these activities 
we expense research and development costs as we incur them 
research and development r d expenses decreased million  or approximately from to  primarily due to reductions in facilities  outside services  personnel  travel and recruiting expense  reflecting the impact of our restructuring efforts 
r d expenses were relatively flat from to we currently believe that we have the appropriate amount of research and development staffing and do not anticipate research and development expenses increasing or decreasing significantly during general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist primarily of cash compensation and related costs for general corporate personnel  along with rent  network operations costs  and general support costs 
these expenses also include the costs of outside professionals  including legal counsel  accountants and investment bankers 
g a expenses decreased million  or approximately from to of the decrease  million is primarily due to reductions in personnel costs as a result of our reduction in workforce 
in addition  reductions in professional fees of million  and facility expense of million also contributed to the decrease between periods 
g a expenses decreased million  or approximately  from to of the decrease  million is primarily due to reductions in personnel costs as a result of our reduction in workforce 
in addition  decreases in travel  outside services primarily contractors  telecommunications  software  and taxes of million  million  million   and  respectively  also contributed to the decrease between periods 
professional fees accounting  legal and investment banking were essentially flat between and however  the fees included approximately million that aether incurred during the fourth quarter of in pursuing potential strategic transactions that  as of the end of the fiscal year  management did not expect would be completed 
professional fees are reported as part of aether s g a expenses and are generated  partly  by the costs of being a public company 
these costs are partly associated with the corporate governance under the sarbanes oxley act of and nasdaq national market reforms 
in the future  we expect to incur additional costs associated with accounting fees related to the internal control over financial reporting attestation report required by all public companies under section of the sarbanes oxley act of selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotions  sales and marketing personnel  bad debt expense and travel and entertainment 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million  or approximately from to of the decrease  million was due to reductions in personnel costs as a result of our reduction in workforce 
in addition  we experienced reductions in travel of million  facilities expense of million  and advertising of million related to the impact of restructuring and reduced spending on advertising 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million  or approximately  from to of the decrease  million was due to decreased bad debt expense 
the decline in bad debt expense is primarily attributable to improved historical bad debts and a decline in credit concentrations in higher risk customers 
in addition  reductions in personnel costs of approximately  as a result of our reduction in workforce and decreased spending on outside services of approximately  also contributed to the decrease between periods 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of the amortization of intangible assets obtained in connection with our acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expenses also include depreciation expenses arising from equipment purchased for our data centers and other property and equipment purchases 
depreciation and amortization decreased million from to the decrease was primarily a result of the impairment charges recorded during and  which significantly reduced the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles  and from the adoption of sfas no 
on january   requiring us to cease amortizing approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce 
for more information on our adoption of sfas no 
 please refer to the discussion under the heading impairment charges acquisitions  which appears above 
depreciation and amortization decreased million from to the decrease was primarily a result of the impairment charges recorded during and  which significantly reduced the carrying value of other intangibles and other long lived assets 
given the reduction of the net book value of our assets as a result of impairment charges  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to decrease in the short term

liquidity and capital resources since  we have financed our operations primarily from the proceeds of public offerings and private placements of our equity and debt securities 
through december   we have raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately billion  net of underwriters discounts  including the issuance in march of million of convertible subordinated notes due at december   cash and investments available for sale were million and working capital was million 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments available for sale and working capital of approximately million 
the significant changes in cash and investments available for sale and working capital from to results from a change during the third quarter of in management s intention with regard to the liquidation of investments with maturities of more than months 
in view of market conditions that resulted in an increase in the trading price of aether s outstanding convertible subordinated notes and aether s ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives as discussed above under the heading introduction  in the third quarter of management concluded it no longer had an intention to liquidate such investments within a month period to fund debt repurchases or other strategic activities 
accordingly  while the types of investments have not changed  such investments totaling approximately million as of december  are now classified as non current assets 
the aggregate outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated notes due  including accrued and unpaid interest  was million as of december  the foregoing amounts exclude the net assets of our discontinued operations  which were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the following table reflects use of net cash for operations  investing  and financing net cash used by operating activities from continuing operations net cash used by discontinued operations net cash used by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents our operations have never generated positive cash flow 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for and  respectively 
of the net cash used by operating activities  million and million was from continuing operations for and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in each of these periods was to fund our losses from operations 
the amount of cash used to support our operating activities has declined significantly as a result of our restructuring efforts 
the amount of cash provided by or used in our investing activities fluctuates primarily based on the timing of our sales and purchases of investments available for sale 
in managing our cash balances  we buy and sell investments available for sale both those that we classify as current assets and those that we classify as non current assets primarily to maximize returns based upon current market conditions 
accordingly  we may sell an investment to realize a gain or limit a loss in response to changes in market conditions 
during  we used only a small portion of our cash to purchase assets used in the operations of our business 
accordingly  our investing activities have not materially increased or decreased the aggregate amount of cash and investments available for sale that we have to meet our liquidity needs 
net cash used in investing activities was million for during  we used million for the purchase of property and equipment  a net of million for the purchases and sales of short term and non current investment instruments primarily united states government agency sponsored securities and million in acquisition related activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for during  we used  for the purchase of property and equipment and million for the purchase of intellectual property 
additionally  we received a net of million from the sales and purchases of short term and non current investment instruments primarily united states government agency sponsored securities and approximately  from sales of certain property and equipment 
the primary difference between and is that in we began to invest our cash in united states government agency sponsored securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
during  we used million to repurchase a portion of our convertible subordinated notes 
during  financing activities included the investment of approximately million of cash in certificates of deposit  which are used as collateral against certain letters of credit established to support facility leases and the performance of certain customer contracts 
this amount is reported on our balance sheet as restricted cash 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to cover our operating expenses and material commitments for at least the next months  including expenses associated with our evaluation of strategic options 
our contractual obligations are summarized below  under the heading contractual obligations 
although our business continues to generate net losses that we must fund with our cash resources  we have significantly reduced the amount of our net losses  and our consumption of cash  as a result of our restructuring efforts  which have greatly reduced our expenses 
to conserve our cash while our business continues to operate at a loss  we have limited our spending on new technology and product enhancements 
this may place us at a competitive disadvantage in seeking to retain existing customers and win new customers  particularly where we are competing against companies with greater resources to spend on technology and product development 
we will be required to repay our convertible subordinated notes in march  which will consume a substantial portion of our existing cash resources 
it is possible that  as a result of our strategic activities  the holders of the notes will become entitled to demand repayment at an earlier date  as discussed under the heading introduction  which appears above  in part i of this report 
to the extent that we decide  as a result of our ongoing strategic evaluation process  to expand or substantially alter our business  we may require additional third party funding  which we may seek through the sale of equity or debt securities  or from bank borrowings 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional funding on favorable terms or at all 
letters of credit during the normal course of operations  we have entered into various letters of credit 
these generally serve as collateral to secure the performance of our obligations to government agencies that are customers of our mobile government segment 
as of december   we had outstanding million in letters of credit  which expire at various times over the next eight years 
these letters of credit would not be drawn unless we fail to perform our obligations to our customers or become involved in performance disputes with our customers 
at december   there were no pending or threatened claims against any of the outstanding letters of credit 
guarantees and warranties we have certain guarantees requiring disclosure under fin as follows we have guaranteed the payment to our landlord on several properties we have sublet 
the maximum guarantee on these properties is million 
in our mobile government segment  we may have to pay liquidated damages in some cases if our subcontractors do not perform on time 
in addition  we sometimes indemnify certain of our customers against damages  if any  they might incur as a result of a claim brought against them related to third party software imbedded in our products 
we are unable to estimate the maximum exposure of such indemnifications due to the inherent uncertainty and the varying nature of contractual terms 
we generally warrant our products against certain manufacturing and other defects 
these product warranties are provided for specific periods of time and or usage of the product depending on the nature of the product and other factors 
as of december  and  we had accrued approximately  and  respectively  for estimated product warranty claims 
the accrued product warranty costs are based primarily on historical experience of actual warranty claims as well as current information on repair cost 
the following table provides the changes in our product warranty accrual warranty liability balance at beginning of year liabilities accrued for warranties issued during the period changes in liability for warranties during the period  including claims paid and expirations warranty liability balance at end of year contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual commitments  including our future minimum lease payments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total long term debt obligations include interest of approximately million through march these convertible subordinated notes are due in march however  a holder of these notes can demand that we purchase the notes upon a change in control which is defined in the indenture that governs the notes to include  among other things  the acquisition of more than of our outstanding voting stock by any person or group  a significant change in the composition of the board of directors and a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
to the extent that we complete additional divestitures or engage in other strategic transactions  a change in control may occur  or holders of the notes may claim that one had occurred 
in such event  they may require us to repay their notes immediately 
this would reduce the amount of cash we have to operate our business 
facilities representing million of our minimum lease payments have been subleased or are available for sublease 
although there can be no assurance  we expect actual expenditures related to the above commitments will be less than indicated above due to reductions we are in the process of negotiating 
aether does not have any other long term liabilities requiring cash payment deferred rent and deferred revenue do not require a cash outlay that are not already included in the categories above 
for instance  the entire long term portion of our restructuring reserve relates to our operating lease obligations which are already quantified in the second line of the above table 
we have not included contracts for maintenance support on hardware or software that we own since we generally pay in advance for these services and have the option of choosing whether or not to renew these services each year 
we have also not included in this table potential contingent liabilities that we may have to the buyer of our ems segment  under the terms of the purchase agreement with the buyer 
we are not aware of any such liabilities  and we cannot readily estimate the potential amount of liabilities that might arise in the future  if any 
as discussed under the heading risk factors  which appears below  our total liability under the purchase agreement for breaches of our representations and warranties is capped at million  except for claims relating to fraud and for matters covered by certain specific representations  such as those relating to taxes owed for periods prior to the date of the transaction 
we also remain fully liable for matters that relate to our ownership and operation of the ems segment prior to the sale of that business 
risk factors you should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this annual report  including the financial statements and related notes  in evaluating our business and our prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business and financial results could suffer 
risks of our strategic activities the following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that may affect our efforts to identify and implement strategic options that we believe will enable us to achieve our business objectives  as described in part i of this report under the heading introduction 
these risks and uncertainties may cause us to be unable to implement a desired strategy or may result in a strategic option failing to achieve its expected results 
we may not be able to implement a business strategy that will achieve our objectives 
we are currently exploring various business strategies designed to achieve profitability as quickly as possible in the near term and enhance the value of our assets for our stockholders over the longer term 
we are continuing to evaluate and actively explore a range of possible options  including additional divestitures  the acquisition or commencement of complementary businesses or new lines of business  the negotiation of alliances or joint ventures with customers or strategic partners  alternative strategies for investing our cash balances and other alternatives that we believe will help us to achieve our announced objectives 
we may not be able to effect any of these strategic options on favorable terms or at all 
in pursuing these strategies and alternatives  the company is likely to spend money  resources and time that would otherwise have been dedicated to the operation of our business segments 
this may negatively impact the value of our existing business 
we may be unable to secure additional financing to implement a business strategy that we would like to pursue 
we do not currently have any agreements or credit facilities under which we can obtain funds  if necessary 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  together with our liquid investments  will be adequate to fund our operating plans for at least the next months 
however  we may need additional debt or equity financing in order to implement a new business strategy 
additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  such financing may not be on terms favorable to us 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
we may not be able to realize value from our accumulated net operating and net capital losses 
our ability to use our accumulated net operating losses to reduce future income tax payments may be limited 
as of december   we had approximately million of accumulated net operating losses for federal income tax purposes  which are available to offset future federal taxable income for a defined period of time  until they expire between and these losses will only be valuable if we are able to generate significant taxable income in future years 
because we have never generated a profit  we may not be able to realize value from these losses 
we have also incurred capital losses of approximately million that we can carryforward as potential tax deduction but only against capital gains until they expire between and in addition  under complex provisions of the federal income tax laws  our ability to use these losses both net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards in the future may be limited if it is determined that a ownership change occurred with respect to the ownership of shares of our company 
generally speaking  an ownership change will be deemed to occur if  over any three year cumulative period  there has been a increase in ownership of our shares by percent stockholders  and certain other persons  of more than percentage points 
while we do not believe that a ownership change has occurred as of the current date  the internal revenue service might  in the future  contest this conclusion and seek to impose a limit on our use of these accumulated net operating losses and accumulated capital losses 
if the internal revenue service were successful in such a challenge  and if the net operating losses and capital losses would be valuable to us absent any such limitation on their use  the result of such a challenge would be a significant loss of value to our company and our stockholders 
as a result of uncertainty about our long term business strategy  we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers 
we also may lose employees 
we have not yet adopted a comprehensive business strategy and we cannot yet determine what our operations will look like in the future 
we are continuing to evaluate various strategic alternatives that we believe will accelerate our ability to become profitable and allow us to realize greater value for our stockholders 
in january  we sold our ems segment and our business has gone through a significant change 
going forward  as part of this strategic process  we may pursue additional divestitures  acquisitions or other business opportunities  none of which may be successful 
because of this uncertainty  existing and potential customers may have concerns about our long term viability and may be hesitant to commit to a long term relationships with us 
our employees may also have concerns about their continued employment with the company  may be distracted from their job responsibilities and even may seek employment with another company possibly a competitor 
prospective employees may also be hesitant to accept employment with the company because of uncertainty over the future of such position 
while we believe we have been able to retain our employees and our existing customers during  potential customers may be reluctant to invest in our products if they do not believe that we will continue to support  enhance or update them 
therefore  until we settle on and announce a comprehensive strategy  our relationships with existing and potential customers as well as our employees and prospective employees may be adversely affected 
debt service obligations  particularly if we are required to repay our notes prior to their maturity  may adversely our ability to fund our existing operations and pursue strategic options 
we have a substantial amount of debt  consisting primarily of million of convertible subordinated notes due a holder of these notes can demand that we purchase the notes upon a change in control which is defined in the indenture that governs the notes to include  among other things  the acquisition of more than of aether s outstanding voting stock by any person or group  a significant change in the composition of the board of directors and a sale of all or substantially all of aether s assets 
to the extent that we pursue a business strategy that constitutes a change in control  we may be required to repay some or all of the notes immediately 
we do not intend to repay any notes prior to maturity unless demanded by the note holder 
any repayment of these notes would reduce the amount of cash we have to operate our business 
if we use our available cash to repay the notes prior to  there will be a significant reduction in the amount of cash available to pay other obligations and support our operating losses and our financial condition may change significantly 
in any event  these notes will mature and become payable in march we may be subject to liabilities relating to assets that we sell after we cease to own them 
we may be required to indemnify tcs for certain breaches of representations and warranties and other covenants that we gave to tcs with respect to the sale of the ems segment 
this liability is limited to million  other than in the case of fraud and with respect to a small number of specific representations  such as those relating to taxes owed for period prior to the closing of the sale of the ems segment 
in addition  we remain fully liable for any claims that may arise relating to our operation of the ems business prior to the date on which tcs acquired that business from us 
although we are not currently aware of any potential claims that we would expect to be significant  claims may arise in the future that could impose substantial liabilities on us 
in addition  we could have continuing liability for our past sales of the blackberry devices manufactured by research in motion rim 
currently  rim is engaged in legal proceedings with inpro ii that alleges that certain rim products infringed on patents held by inpro 
under the patent act  we could be liable for six years for making  using  selling or offering to sell the rim devices 
in addition  in the spring and summer of  a federal district court awarded substantial money damages against rim and granted and then immediately stayed  pending appeal an injunction against rim that would prohibit rim from selling various blackberry devices  software or services  in the united states 
the case involves claims that rim s blackberry technology infringes the patents of another company  ntp  inc rim has said it is appealing this decision  and the us patent and trademark office pto is reexamining the validity of certain of ntp s patent claims 
we cannot assess the likelihood that rim will succeed in any appeal or that the pto will narrow or find any of these patent claims invalid  or that rim will be able to negotiate a license with the company that holds the patents at issue 
ultimately  rim might be prohibited from selling blackberry devices or might raise its prices to offset licensing fees or damage payments 
the likelihood that we may have liability to inpro or ntp  inc if it is established that rim s blackberry in fact infringes inpro s patents is unclear  and the extent of any liability unknown 
in additional divestitures  we expect to have potential liabilities for past events as well as for any breaches of representations that we make in any sale agreement 
the terms of such potential liabilities are likely to differ somewhat from those that were agreed to by tcs 
they may be broader or narrower in scope  may last a longer or shorter period of time  and may be subject to different monetary limits 
risks of our existing businesses the following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties associated with the operation of our existing mobile government and transportation businesses 
if we sell either of these businesses  these risks may diminish in significance  particularly if we acquire or commence other businesses 
as a result of our organizational restructuring and expense reduction program  we may not have sufficient staffing to support our operations  which could reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our revenue 
our business strategy is based on the assumption that the number of subscribers to our services  the amount of information they want to receive and the number of services we offer will all increase 
we must continue to develop and expand our systems and operations to accommodate this growth 
at the same time  we have significantly streamlined our organization and reduced our operating expenses 
these efforts have included a reduction in operational and management resources and a consolidation of our facilities 
while we believe that our cost  personnel and facilities reductions have targeted areas that are not necessary to maintain and develop our ability to serve customers  there can be no assurance that the changes will not have a negative impact on our ability to provide service 
if we fail to maintain or improve service levels  we may lose customers and or the opportunity to provide more services and products 
the success of our mobile government segment depends on our ability to access decision makers at thousands of local government agencies before they choose their preferred wireless data vendor 
the mobile government segment targets the police and fire departments of local governments  of which there are tens of thousands across the united states 
it is our experience that the local governments are not under any state mandate to acquire wireless data technology in a particular way or at a particular time 
as a result  it is time consuming and expensive to target all local governments  or to know when they are making the decision to purchase mobile data devices 
if we miss an opportunity to bid to provide services  it is unlikely that we will be given an opportunity at a later time 
our mobile government segment may need to make additional investment to remain competitive in the marketplace 
the public safety industry has experienced growing demand for computer aided design cad and record management system rms functionality in tailored solutions 
our existing product suite does not currently include these features 
to the extent our potential customers desire this functionality  the growth of our business could be limited 
as we seek to serve larger fleet owners  we face competition from businesses with greater financial resources  and we may be unable to compete effectively with these businesses 
the existing market for wireless and mobile data solutions for the transportation industry is competitive 
competition is particularly vigorous for larger fleet owners  which is a customer segment we have worked to serve 
we expect competition to increase further as companies develop new products and or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours 
these competitors may have better name recognition  better product lines  greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  significantly greater financial resources  and existing relationships with some of our potential customers 
we may not be able to effectively compete with these companies 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete 
in addition  these companies may reduce costs to customers and seek to obtain our customers through cost cutting and other measures 
to the extent these companies compete effectively with us  our business could be adversely affected 
our products may contain defects or errors  and our sales could decrease if this injures our reputation or delays shipments of our products 
we subcontract all of the manufacturing and assembly to third parties and rely on these third parties to deliver and support reliable products 
our reliance on sole or limited source vendors involves risks 
these risks include product performance shortfalls  manufacturing capability  quality assurance  quantity and costs 
we have in the past and may in the future  encounter problems with certain of the products that we purchase from third parties 
in certain cases  we have agreements with the device manufacturer for indemnity in the event of a defect in the craftsmanship or operation of such product 
recently  our mobilemax product has experienced some warranty repair issues 
as of december   we have reserved approximately  for such warranty claims 
we may incur additional repair or replacement costs in the future in excess of the amount we have reserved for  which would increase our expenses and reduce our earnings 
in addition  we are unable to quantify the impact  if any  on our reputation and customer goodwill 
also  defective products such as the ones we have experienced recently and other defects we may experience in the future may result in customer dissatisfaction and customer attrition 
our software may contain defects or errors  and our sales could decrease if this injures our reputation or delays shipments of our software 
our software products and platforms are complex and must meet the stringent technical requirements of our customers 
because of such complexity  our products and platforms may contain defects and errors that are detected only when the products are in use 
further  because our products perform critical functions in our customers products and networks  such defects or errors could have a serious impact on our customers  which could damage our reputation  harm our customer relationships and potentially expose us to liability 
we may also experience component or software failures or defects which could require significant product recalls  reworks and or repairs which are not covered by warranty reserves and which could consume a substantial portion of the capacity of our third party manufacturers or those of our customers 
resolving any defect or failure related issues could consume financial and or engineering resources that could affect future product release schedules 
we may incur costs particular to being a government contractor 
in our mobile government segment  we act as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a variety of federal  state and local government programs that are subject to the availability of government funding  government audit rights  and termination at the convenience of the government 
these contracts and subcontracts may contain detailed requirements  warranties and software and data rights licenses  and may provide us access to confidential information maintained by federal  state and local security agencies 
profit on these contracts may subject to limitations and may be subject to audit and recovery rights by governmental agencies 
our contracts are typically obtained on a fixed price basis  and as a result we benefit from cost savings and carry the burden of cost overruns 
based on the terms of these contracts and applicable laws  our business operations may be subject to restrictions and requirements applicable to government procurements  including rules pertaining to relationships with government officials and the accuracy of information provided to government agencies 
failure to comply with such restrictions and requirements could lead to our suspension or debarment for cause  from contracting or subcontracting on governmental programs for a period of time 
under some of these contracts  we are also required to maintain security clearances and compliance with the privacy act of  as amended 
we depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others 
if we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks  we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers such as motient communications company motient  minor planet systems usa minor planet and mobile satellite ventures  msv inc and on the reliability and security of their systems 
all of our services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties 
we depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted and defect free service and would not be able to satisfy our customers needs if they failed to provide the required capacity or needed level and quality of service 
in addition  our expenses would increase and our profitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services 
our transportation segment is dependent on msv for its satellite communications and on motient for its terrestrial radio based data communications network service 
if motient ceased performing under its obligations under the terrestrial network reseller agreement and we were unable to find a replacement provider on similar terms and conditions  our business would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  minor planet our network services supplier for our hm customers  recently filed a petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
although we believe minor planet will continue to fulfill its obligations under its agreement with aether and provide hm airtime services  the possibility exists that minor planet will seek authority from the bankruptcy court to reject the transition services agreement and cease performing 
if minor planet successfully rejects the transition services agreement and fails to perform its obligations  we will seek other means of supplying service to our highway master customers  but there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such replacement services 
any type of systems failure could reduce sales  increase costs or result in claims of liability 
any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could result in delays in our subscribers ability to receive information 
we cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience a hardware or software failure or if there is an earthquake  fire or other natural disaster  a power or telecommunications failure  intentional disruptions of service by third parties  an act of god or an act of war 
a failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data  and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business 
new laws and regulations that impact our industry could increase our costs or reduce our opportunities to earn revenue 
we are not currently subject to direct regulation by the federal communications commission or any other governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to publicly traded delaware corporations of similar size that are headquartered in maryland 
however  in the future  we may become subject to regulation by the fcc or another regulatory agency 
in addition  the wireless carriers that supply us airtime and certain of our hardware suppliers are subject to regulation by the fcc and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduce our ability to continue selling and supporting our services 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  have required most public companies  including our company  to devote additional internal and external resources to various governance and compliance matters 
because we have a relatively small corporate staff  we rely heavily on outside professional advisers to assist us with these efforts 
as a result  we incurred additional operating expenses in and will incur further expenses in the future 
these future costs will include increased accounting related fees associated with preparing the attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting as required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs have offset a portion of the savings we realized through our expense reduction program 
in addition  these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  as well as modifications by the government and nasdaq 
the way in which they are applied and implemented may change over time  which could result in even higher costs to address and implement revisions to compliance including disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and in addition to increased general and administrative expenses  this investment will require management to devote time and attention that will not be available for other matters 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed and we could be exposed to potential liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
we maintain instruments subject to interest rate risk 
we categorize all of our market risk sensitive instruments as non trading or other instruments 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and investments available for sale 
our investment policy calls for investment in short term low risk instruments 
all investments in securities with maturities greater than one year are held as available for sale  in compliance with our investment policy 
at december   we had million including restricted cash invested in money market  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
at december   we had million invested in us government agency sponsored securities with maturities that range from less than one year to three years 
we believe that a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our investment income or cash flows 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate subordinated convertible notes payable 
the fair value of this fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
if market rates decline  the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policy  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our risk of interest rate fluctuations 
as our long term debt obligations bear fixed interest rates  we have minimal cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes associated with our long term debt obligations 
as a result of our sale of the ems segment in january  we ceased to have any operations outside of the united states 
consequently  neither our results of operations nor our financial condition is subject to any ongoing foreign exchange rate risks
