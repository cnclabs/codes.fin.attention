the company did not purchase deep enough quantities in certain key classifications of merchandise  and sales in the best selling items were not maximized 
comparable store sales declined during the fourth quarter in the full price retail stores as compared to a decline of for the fourth quarter of prior year for the full price retail stores 
this was combined with significant sales declines in the outlet division 
comparable store sales in o utlets declined during the company determined that it had too many outlet stores and closed four of the seven outlet stores in the first half of since the company purchased very little merchandise in directly for the outlet division  the outlet store inventories throughout the year were down significantly over the prior year 
additionally  the outlets were used to liquidate older inventory  resulting in more units being sold but at lower prices 
another variable to the total company sales declines was the reduction in warehouse sales conducted  as the company s available inventory levels declined 
warehouse sale volume declined by million  or  in as compared to the prior year 
the company s gross margin increased to in from in the increase in the company s gross margin was primarily due to fewer markdowns being recorded in the full price stores due to stronger sales

for  the restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter consisted of severance costs of approximately  associated with elimination of positions in the corporate office  with the remainder of restructuring charges attributable to the acceleration of amortization of assets in conjunction with planned store closings in the first half of total interest expense decreased  from due to lower average interest rates on the company s outstanding borrowings

increases to interest expense may occur if the company s cash flow requires additional borrowed funds 
during  interest costs including capitalized interest decreased  as compared to due to lower outstanding debt balances 
lower average interest rates were also a contributing factor 
the decrease in average debt balances resulted principally from the sale of preferred stock in the amount of  and the application of the proceeds of such sale to reduce debt 
also  the company experienced a significant increase in accoun ts payable 
because the company uses its line of credit to finance much of its accounts payable  an increase in accounts payable will increase interest costs 
the company s effective income tax rate was in  in and in the company did not elect to record the full tax benefit for all or losses in the financial statements 
during  the company increased its valuation allowance to fully provide for all remaining deferred tax assets because the company s recent history of operating losses makes the realization of these assets uncertain

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  the company believes it has taken conservative positions  where assumptions and estimates are used  in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates 
in management s opinion  the areas of the company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in th e allowance for doubtful accounts related to the company s proprietary credit card program  the valuation of inventory  asset impairment estimates and revenue recognition 
the selection  application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
in  approximately of the company s net retail sales were made under its proprietary credit card program  which resulted in customer accounts receivable balances of approximately  at january  the company has significant experience in managing its credit card program 
each month  the company reviews all of its credit card accounts and writes off those deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained and periodically reviewed 
the allowance is primarily based on account write off trends and aging information 
the company does not expect actual results to vary significantly from its estimate 
the company uses the retail inventory method 
under this method  the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
the company closely monitors actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels  and aging information by merchandise categories 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
when a store experiences unfavorable operating performance  the company evaluates whether an impairment charge should be recorded 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the store s estimated undiscounted cash flows to the assets carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  the assets are written down to fair value 
impairment losses associated with these reviews have not been significant 
however  if comparative store sales decline and general negative economic trends continue  future impairment losses could be significant 
sales from store locations represented of the company s total sales for these sales are recognized at the time of the customer s purchase 
sales are net of returns and exclude sales tax 
in august  the company returned to the direct catalog business after exiting this business in first quarter of these sales represented less than one percent of the sales during these sales are recognized at the time the order is shipped to the customer 
gift card sales are recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed  not when it is sold

forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements may be preceded or followed by or otherwise include the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  estimates  will  would  could or similar expressions 
such forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current views of future events and financial performance  involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from planned or expected results 
those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the impact of competition  pricing pressure  product demand and market acceptance risks  mergers and acquisitions  reliance on key strategic alliances  the ability to attract and retain key employees  the availability of cash for growth  fluctuations in operating res ults  ability to continue funding operating losses  and the ability of new management to improve the company s financial condition and performance 
for all of these reasons  actual results may vary materially from the forward looking statements 
the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
commitments the following table reflects certain of the company s commitments as of january  payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt store leases operating leases other than stores purchase obligations total the expiration of the company s loan agreement  which represents the overwhelming majority of this amount  is february  it is unlikely such debt will be repaid within one year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
store leases are based on minimum rents exclusive of percentage rent based on sales which could increase rental expense 
the foregoing table does not include contractual commitments pursuant to executory contracts for products and services such as telephone  data  computer maintenance and other regular payments pursuant to contracts that are expected to remain in existence for several years but as to which the company s obligations are contingent upon the company s continued receipt of the contracted products and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for the company refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate at january   the company had long term debt outstanding of approximately million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
the remaining million bears interest at a variable rate  which averaged approximately during a increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debt outstanding at january  would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change is also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates expected maturity in thousands thereafter total long term debt variable rate weighted average interest rate fixed rate weighted average interest rate foreign currency substantially all of the company s purchases are priced in us dollars 
however  some european purchases are denominated in local currency and  therefore  are subject to the fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
from time to time the company utilizes forward exchange contracts to secure firm pricing related to purchase commitments to be denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts are of varying short term durations and amounts include a window delivery feature  which provides the company with an option to enter into a swap agreement in the event that all of the currency is not utilized at the end of the contract s delivery term 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the principal currency hedged is the italian lira 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
the company had no foreign exchange instruments outstanding at january   therefore  a sensitivity analysis would result in no impact to earnings 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies would be excluded from the sensitivity analysis 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during  or
