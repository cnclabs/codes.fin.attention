overview we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturer operating in three segments water  enclosures  and tools 
our water segment manufactures and markets essential products and systems used in the movement  treatment  storage and enjoyment of water and generates approximately percent of total revenues 
our enclosures segment accounts for approximately percent of total revenues and designs  manufactures and markets standard  modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components for markets that include industrial machinery  data communications  networking  telecommunications  test and measurement  automotive  medical  security  defense  and general electronics 
our tools segment designs  manufactures and markets a wide range of power tools under several well established trade names generating approximately percent of total revenues 
our water segment has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from million in to approximately billion in we have identified target industry segments totaling billion  representing a small portion of the billion global water market 
we continue to capitalize on growth opportunities in the water industry as evidenced by four product line acquisitions in our water segment in as well as the acquisition of everpure on december  in february  we announced our agreement to acquire wicor  the completion of which would mark a dramatic shift in our water segment 
we anticipate that the assimilation of these acquisitions into our business operations will create a billion business in the water industry 
our enclosures segment operates in a large global market with significant headroom in the industry niches such as defense  security  medical  and networking 
we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and highest brand recognition in the industry 
during the past few years  the enclosures segment experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial market and over capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets 
however  this segment did experience growth in across the electrical and electronic markets and we believe it is well positioned to continue improved performance 
in addition  through the success of our pentair integrated management system pims and supply management initiatives we have increased enclosures segment margins for the eighth sequential quarter 
our tools segment has been operating in a very competitive marketplace during the past few years 
pricing pressures and higher raw material costs have caused our operating margins to decline 
in february  we announced our intent to explore strategic alternatives for our tools segment 
we will continue to operate the tools segment for the long term and provide all appropriate management support and resources 
we continue to seek opportunities to expand operating margins through cost reductions and productivity improvements as part of our pims initiatives 
in addition  we plan to continue to launch innovative new products and pursue significant incremental volume opportunities 
key trends and uncertainties the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in and will likely impact our results in the future we have experienced a decrease in average selling prices and declines in operating margins in our tools segment due to increased promotional programs 
we expect these competitive pressures to lessen somewhat  but still persist in we expect all three segments to continue to benefit from our key initiatives  including supply management and pims 

table of contents expenses related to downsizing are anticipated to continue as we identify more efficient means to manufacture and distribute our products 
free cash flow  defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures  including both continuing and discontinued operations  exceeded million for the second straight year and is expected to exceed million in see our discussion of other financial measures under the caption liquidity and capital resources of this report 
in  we experienced favorable foreign currency effects  primarily for the us dollar against the euro  which may not trend favorably in the future 
before any effects of our planned acquisition of wicor  we expect our effective tax rate on continuing operations to be approximately percent in our ultimate effective tax rate will depend on the timing of the planned wicor acquisition and wicor s actual tax attributes 
following the planned acquisition of wicor  we will need to fund the repayment of our bridge facility by december  through a disposition of our tools group or through equity issuance 
business transformation on february   we entered into an agreement to acquire wicor inc wicor  a unit of wisconsin energy corporation  milwaukee  wisconsin 
wicor  which manufactures water system  filtration  and pool equipment products under the sta rite  shurflo  and hypro brands  generated sales of approximately million in the million cash transaction  which we plan to complete in the second or third quarter of  is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions and applicable regulatory approvals 
as part of the transaction  we will assume approximately million of wicor debt 
the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of its large global market  approximating billion  and a growing demand for clean water 
our vision is to become the leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement  treatment  storage  and enjoyment of water 
we expect to achieve million in synergies with respect to the wicor acquisition in the first months of operations via key initiatives including pims  material cost savings and administrative cost savings 
we also expect to achieve significant working capital reductions  fixed asset reductions and capital expenditure savings as a result of the acquisition 
we also announced that we have engaged goldman sachs to explore strategic alternatives for our tools segment  comprising the porter cable  delta  devilbiss air power company  oldham saw and flex businesses with  in net sales in outlook in  our operating objectives include the following integrate the december  everpure acquisition  complete and integrate the wicor acquisition  complete the review of strategic alternatives for our tools segment  and continue to drive our five strategic initiatives cash flow  supply management  pims  talent management  and organic sales growth 
financial measures in our management s discussion and analysis  we make reference to certain non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures  including gross profit  operating income  selling  general and administrative sg a  income from continuing operations before income taxes  and provision for income taxes  in each case excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charges or excluding restructuring charge 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they provide investors with 
table of contents other measures to consider  in conjunction with the gaap results  which may be helpful to meaningfully compare our operating performance between periods 
we also use these non gaap financial measures when assessing our own operating performance 
a description of the accounting standards applicable to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill is included below under new accounting standards 
a description of the restructuring charges that we exclude from gaap results is included below under results of operations restructuring charges 
in each case below when we make reference to a non gaap financial measure  we also provide reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure

the percent increase in tools segment sales in from was primarily due to higher sales volume in our devilbiss air power company dapc business  particularly for pressure washers  higher sales volume in our delta business as a result of our new sub branding strategy through the creation of delta shopmaster and delta industrial brands 
the delta shopmaster brand is targeted toward the entry level do it yourselfer and the delta industrial brand is targeted toward the professional craftsman  and the fourth quarter acquisition of oldham saw 
these increases were partially offset by declines in average selling prices due to the introduction of lower price point products for the delta shopmaster brand and heavy second half promotional pricing in a more competitive marketplace

table of contents restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program designed to consolidate manufacturing operations and eliminate non critical support facilities in our enclosures segment 
we also wrote off internal use software development costs at corporate for the abandonment of a company wide human resource system 
consequently  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  of which million is included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statement of income for the write down of inventory on certain custom enclosures product that were discontinued as a result of plant closures 
in the fourth quarter of  we also recorded a final change in estimate related to our restructuring charge that reduced the restructuring charge by million primarily due to favorable negotiation of contract termination costs 
as of the end of  the restructuring program initiated in was complete 
included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets is the remaining portion of the restructuring charge liability of million  primarily related to severance obligations not yet paid to certain terminated individuals and other charges as we are awaiting the results of pending and threatened claims by former employees of the affected facilities 
therefore  we are uncertain when this remaining liability will be paid 
payments in of million are comprised of the payout of severance obligations and legal expenses 
funding of future payments will be paid from cash generated from operating activities
