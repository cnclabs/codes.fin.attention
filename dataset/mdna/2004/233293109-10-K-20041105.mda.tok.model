item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item competition and regulation dp l has historically operated in a rate regulated environment providing electric generation and energy delivery  consisting of transmission and distribution services  as a single product to its retail customers 
prior to the legislation discussed below  dp l did not have competitors in its service territory 
in october  legislation became effective in ohio that gave electric utility customers a choice of energy providers beginning on january  under this legislation  electric generation  power marketing  and power brokerage services supplied to retail customers in ohio are deemed to be competitive and are not subject to supervision and regulation by the puco 
as required by this legislation  dp l filed its transition plan electric transition plan with the puco on december  dp l received the puco approval of its plan on september  the electric transition plan provided for a three year transition period  which began on january  and ended on december  the plan also provided for a residential rate reduction on the generation component of the rates  which reduced annual revenue by approximately million  rate certainty for the three year period for customers that continued to purchase power from dp l  guaranteed rates for a six year period for transmission and delivery services  and recovery by dp l of transition costs of approximately million 
on october   dp l filed with the puco a request for an extension of its market development period from december  to december  that  if granted  would continue dp l s current rate structure and provide its retail customers with rate stability 
on may   dp l filed with the puco a stipulation and recommendation entered into with five other parties ohio consumers counsel the occ  industrial energy users ohio  puco staff  partners for affordable energy  and community action partnership of the greater dayton area 
on september   the puco issued an opinion and order adopting the stipulation with modifications the stipulation 
the stipulation provides the following dp l s market development period will continue through december   retail generation rates will remain frozen at present levels  a credit issued to customers who elect competitive retail generation service will increase over two years  and a rate stabilization period from january  through december   during which dp l s retail generation rates in effect on january  will serve as market based rates 
the stipulation also provides that beginning january   rates may be modified by up to of generation rates to reflect increased costs associated with fuel  environmental compliance  taxes  regulatory changes  and security measures 
further  the puco may approve an increase to the residential generation discount commencing january  the puco denied applications for rehearing on october  the puco s decision was appealed to the ohio supreme court on december  that appeal was argued before the ohio supreme court on october  and the decision is pending 
on february   the puco issued an entry requesting comments from interested stakeholders on the proposed rules for the conduct of a competitive bidding process that will take place at the end of the market development period 
dp l submitted comments and reply comments on march and march   respectively 
the puco issued final rules on december  under dp l s stipulation discussed above  these rules will not affect dp l until january  on march   the puco issued an entry initiating a puco investigation regarding the desirability  feasibility  and timing of declaring that retail ancillary metering  billing and or collection services are competitive retail electric services that consumers may obtain from any supplier 
the initiation of this investigation was based on a requirement in the ohio deregulation legislation 
the puco asked interested stakeholders to file comments by june  and reply comments by july  dp l filed comments and will actively participate in this case and evaluate the potential outcome of this proceeding 
as of december   two unaffiliated marketers were registered as competitive retail electric service cres providers in dp l s service territory  to date  there has been no significant activity 
dpl energy resources  inc  an affiliated company  is also a registered cres provider 
in addition  several communities in dp l s service area have passed ordinances allowing the communities to become government aggregators for the purpose of offering alternative electric generation supplies to their citizens 
to date none of these communities have aggregated 
there has been a complaint filed at the puco concerning the pricing of dp l s billing services 
additionally  a complaint has been filed at the puco alleging that dp l has established improper barriers to competition 
on october   the parties reached a settlement on the pricing of dp l s billing services that dp l will charge cres providers 
additionally on october  dp l entered into a settlement with dominion retail  green mountain energy  and the staff of the puco that resolves all matters in the competition barrier complaint 
this settlement provides that dp l will modify the manner in which customer partial payments are applied to billing charges and dp l will no longer offer to purchase the receivables of cres providers who operate in dp l s certified territory 
both settlements are subject to puco approval 
like other utilities and energy marketers  dp l and dple may sell or purchase electric generating capacity on the wholesale market 
dp l and dple compete with other generators  privately and municipally owned electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives when selling electricity 
the ability of dp l and dple to sell this electricity will depend on how dp l s and dple s price  terms and conditions compare to those of other suppliers 
in addition  from time to time  dp l may purchase power from other suppliers 
these purchases may be affected by privately and municipally owned electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives  and other alternate fuel suppliers on the basis of price and service 
dp l provides transmission and wholesale electric service to twelve municipal customers in its service territory  which distribute electricity within their incorporated limits 
dp l also maintains an interconnection agreement with one municipality that has the capability to generate a portion of its energy requirements 
sales to these municipalities represented of total electricity sales in the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued a final rule on december   which required all public utilities that own  operate  or control interstate transmission lines to file a proposal to join a regional transmission organization rto by october  or file a description of efforts taken to participate in an rto  reasons for not participating in an rto  any obstacles to participation in an rto and any plans for further work toward participation 
dp l filed with the ferc to join the alliance rto 
on december   the ferc issued an order rejecting the alliance rto as a stand alone rto 
the ferc has recognized in various orders that substantial losses were incurred to establish the alliance rto and that it would consider proposals for rate recovery of prudently incurred costs 
dp l invested approximately million in its efforts to join the alliance rto 
on may   dp l filed a notice with the ferc stating its intention to join the pennsylvania jersey maryland interconnection llc pjm  an organization responsible for the operation and control of the bulk electric power system throughout major portions of five mid atlantic states and the district of columbia 
on july   the ferc granted dp l conditional approval to join pjm 
in june  dp l turned over five transmission functions for pjm to operate including oasis management  atc calculations  scheduling  market monitoring and security coordination 
as of december   dpl had invested a total of approximately million in its efforts to join an rto 
on july   dp l made a filing with the ferc to withdraw its transmission tariff and to become fully integrated into pjm s tariff effective october  the company was fully integrated into pjm on october  effective october   pjm began to access a ferc approved administrative fee on every megawatt consumed by dp l customers 
on october   dp l filed an application with the puco for authority to modify its accounting procedures to defer collection of this pjm administrative fee  effective october   plus carrying charges  until such time as dp l has obtained the authority to adjust its rates ie  after january  pursuant to dp l s approved stipulation and recommendation 
the application is pending 
the ferc s july  order also addressed the justness and reasonableness of the pjm and midwest independent transmission system operator miso rates and related revenue distribution protocols 
on march   an initial decision was issued finding that the pjm miso s rates had not been shown to be unjust and unreasonable 
on july   the ferc issued an order rejecting in part the initial decision and found that the rates for transmission service through and out of the service territories of seven former alliance rto companies  including dp l  may be unjust  unreasonable  or unduly discriminatory or preferential 
on august   dp l filed a submission with the ferc stating that there is no basis for the elimination of dp l s through and out rates prior to the date that it joined an rto 
the ferc issued an order directing that through and out rates of all former alliance  miso and pjm rto companies be eliminated 
subsequently  the ferc required the parties to enter into settlement discussions 
on march   the ferc approved a settlement agreement regarding transmission pricing that allows dp l to continue to charge its existing transmission rate until december  the settlement agreement also outlines the principles and procedures to arrive at a single  long term transmission pricing structure to be effective december  on september   the ferc instituted a proceeding under federal power act section to implement a new long term transmission pricing structure intended to eliminate seams in the pjm and miso regions 
the ultimate disposition of this case may affect the recovery of transmission revenues by dp l 
on october   dp l  along with approximately sixty other parties filed a long term pricing plan at ferc 
if approved  the plan will provide for continuation of dp l s existing transmission rate until and transitional payments of approximately million 
in a november  order as modified on april   ferc required entities with market based rate authority to submit their triennial market based reviews using new criteria 
in dp l s case  this submission would have been due august  on july   dp l requested a new compliance date sixty days after integration into pjm to enable dp l to provide an analysis that reflects the market as it will exist in pjm 
on october   ferc denied that request and on october   dp l filed its triennial market based review with ferc 
on march   american municipal power of ohio  inc  on behalf of dp l s municipal customers municipals  filed a complaint at the ferc alleging the municipals will be faced with higher rates under their power services agreement with dp l once the company is fully integrated into an rto as discussed above 
a settlement was filed with the ferc on october  the settlement provides that the power services agreements will continue to be effective 
it also describes how transmission services will be provided as dp l joins pjm and preserves the transmission rates and most ancillary services 
the ferc approved the settlement on december  on july   the ferc issued a standard market design notice of proposed rulemaking smd nopr 
the smd nopr established a proposed set of rules to standardize wholesale electric market design to create wholesale competition and efficient transmission systems 
the effect of this proposed rulemaking on dp l cannot be determined at this time 
on march   the puco staff proposed modifications to the minimum electric service and safety standards  which establish performance standards for various service related functions of investor owned electric utilities 
the proposed modifications affect billing  collections  allocation of customer payments  meter reading  and distribution circuit performance 
the puco issued final rules on september  and dp l filed an application for rehearing on october  the puco issued an entry on rehearing on march  these rules were filed with the joint committee on agency rule review on july  and were effective january  the effect of these rules is not material to the company 
on april   the company received notice that the staff of the puco is conducting an investigation into the financial condition of dp l as a result of the issues raised by the thobe memorandum 
on may   the puco ordered dp l to file a plan of utility financial integrity that outlines the actions the company has taken or will take to insulate dp l utility operations and customers from its unregulated activities 
dp l must file this plan within days of the filing of its form k with the sec 
the company and dp l intend to comply with this order and to cooperate with the puco s continuing investigation 
dp l has requested approval from the puco to extend the filing of its annual report until after the filing of its form k 
dp l has also requested approval from the ferc to extend the filing of its ferc form and ferc form qs until after the filing of its form k 
all of these requests are pending 
on june   dple filed an application for determination of status as an exempt wholesale generator with ferc that was approved by ferc on july  on august  in order to strengthen mvic s financial position  the vermont department of banking  insurance  securities and health care administration notified mvic of mvic s requirement to reduce its intercompany receivable to a maximum no greater than mvic s total capital and surplus plus  minimum capital 
as a result  the company plans to transfer million from its operating cash to its subsidiary mvic in satisfaction of this requirement during the fourth quarter of these funds will not be available for general operating purposes 
construction additions construction additions were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and are expected to approximate million in planned construction additions for relate to dpl s environmental compliance program  power plant equipment  and its transmission and distribution system 
during the last three years  capital expenditures have been utilized to make significant progress on dpl s nitrogen oxide nox compliance program  to make power plant improvements  and to complete construction on approximately  megawatts mw of combustion turbines 
in july  the final phase of the combustion turbine program came on line  adding approximately mw at an investment of million 
dpl has not contracted for further capacity additions at this time 
capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financial and economic conditions  load forecasts  legislative and regulatory developments and changing environmental standards  among other factors 
over the next four years  dpl is projecting to spend million in capital projects  approximately half of which is to meet changing environmental standards 
dpl s ability to complete its capital projects and the reliability of future service will be affected by its financial condition  the availability of internal and external funds at reasonable cost  and adequate and timely return on these capital investments 
dpl expects to finance its construction additions over the next few years with internally generated funds 
see environmental considerations for a description of environmental control projects and regulatory proceedings that may change the level of future construction additions 
the potential effect of these events on dpl s operations cannot be estimated at this time 
electric operations and fuel supply dpl s present summer generating capacity is approximately  mw 
of this capacity  approximately  mw or is derived from coal fired steam generating stations and the balance of approximately  mw or consists of combustion turbine and natural gas powered peaking units 
combustion turbine output is dependent on ambient conditions and is higher in the winter than in the summer 
dp l s all time net peak load was  mw  occurring in approximately of the existing steam generating capacity is provided by certain units owned as tenants in common with the cincinnati gas electric company cg e and columbus southern power company csp 
as tenants in common  each company owns a specified undivided share of each of these units  is entitled to its share of capacity and energy output  and has a capital and operating cost responsibility proportionate to its ownership share 
dp l s remaining steam generating capacity approximately mw is derived from a generating station owned solely by dp l 
additionally  dp l  cg e and csp own as tenants in common  circuit miles of  volt transmission lines 
dp l has several interconnections with other companies for the purchase  sale and interchange of electricity 
in  dpl generated of its electric output from coal fired units and from oil or natural gas fired units  which were used to meet peak demands

the prices to be paid by dp l under its long term coal contracts are subject to adjustment in accordance with various indices 
each contract has features that will limit price escalations in any given year 
as a result of the rising coal market  dp l expects its coal costs to exceed its coal costs by approximately 
the average cost of fuel used per kilowatt hour kwh generated was in  in and in with the onset of competition in january  the electric fuel component was frozen under dp l s electric transition plan and is reflected in the standard offer generation rate to its customers 
see rate regulation and government legislation and environmental considerations 
seasonality the power generation and delivery business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on operating performance 
in the region served by dpl s subsidiaries  demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
historically  the power generation and delivery operations of dpl s subsidiaries have generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
gas operations and gas supply in october  dp l completed the sale of its natural gas retail distribution assets and certain liabilities for million in cash 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million million net of taxes 
proceeds from the sale were used to finance the regional generation expansion and reduce outstanding short term debt 
rate regulation and government legislation dp l s sales to retail customers are subject to rate regulation by the puco 
dp l s wholesale electric rates to municipal corporations and other distributors of electric energy are subject to regulation by the ferc under the federal power act 
ohio law establishes the process for determining rates charged by public utilities 
regulation of rates encompasses the timing of applications  the effective date of rate increases  the cost basis upon which the rates are based and other related matters 
ohio law also established the occ  which has the authority to represent residential consumers in state and federal judicial and administrative rate proceedings 
ohio legislation extends the jurisdiction of the puco to the records and accounts of certain public utility holding company systems  including dpl 
the legislation extends the puco s supervisory powers to a holding company system s general condition and capitalization  among other matters  to the extent that they relate to the costs associated with the provision of public utility service 
based on existing puco authorization  regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
under legislation passed in  the percentage of income payment plan pipp for eligible low income households was converted to a universal service fund in the universal service program is administered by the ohio department of development and provides for full recovery of arrearages for qualifying low income customers

environmental considerations the operations of dpl and dp l  including dp l s commonly owned facilities  are subject to a wide range of federal  state  and local environmental regulations and law as to air and water quality  disposal of solid waste and other environmental matters  including the location  construction and operation of new and existing electric generating facilities and most electric transmission lines 
as such  existing environmental regulations may be periodically revised 
in addition to revised rules  new legislation could be enacted that may affect the company s estimated construction expenditures 
see construction additions 
in the normal course of business  dp l has ongoing programs and activities underway at these facilities to comply  or to determine compliance  with such existing  new and or proposed regulations and legislation 
dp l has been identified  either by a government agency or by a private party seeking contribution to site clean up costs  as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of sites pursuant to state and federal laws 
dp l records liabilities for probable estimated loss in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies 
to the extent a probable loss can only be estimated by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  dp l accrues for the low end of the range 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
dp l evaluates the potential liability related to probable losses quarterly and may revise its estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
air and water quality in november  the united states environmental protection agency usepa filed civil complaints and notices of violations novs against operators and owners of certain generation facilities for alleged violations of the clean air act caa 
generation units operated by cg e beckjord and csp conesville and co owned by dp l were referenced in these actions 
numerous northeast states have filed complaints or have indicated that they will be joining the usepa s action against cg e and csp 
dp l was not identified in the novs  civil complaints or state actions 
in december  cg e announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with the usepa and other plaintiffs in an effort to settle the claims 
as of december   discussions on the final terms of the settlement continue and the outcome of these claims or the effect  if any  on dp l has not been determined 
in june  the usepa issued a nov to dp l operated jm stuart station co owned by dp l  cg e  and csp for alleged violations of the caa 
the nov contained allegations consistent with novs and complaints that the usepa had recently brought against numerous other coal fired utilities in the midwest 
dp l intends to vigorously challenge the nov given the final routine maintenance repair and replacement rules discussed below 
on september  the sierra club filed a lawsuit against the company and the other owners of the stuart generating station in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio for alleged violations of the caa 
the company intends to vigorously defend this matter 
on july   various residents of the village of moscow  ohio notified cg e  as the operator of zimmer co owned by cg e  dp l and csp  of their intent to sue for alleged violations of the caa and air pollution nuisances 
dp l believes the allegations are meritless and believes cg e on behalf of all co owners will vigorously defend the matter 
on october   the usepa published its final rules regarding the equipment replacement provision of the routine maintenance  repair and replacement rmrr exclusion of the caa 
subsequently  on december   the us court of appeals for the us circuit stayed the effective date of the rule pending its decision on the merits of the lawsuits filed by numerous states and environmental organizations challenging the final rules 
as a result of this ruling  it is expected that the ohio environmental protection agency ohio epa will delay its previously announced intent to adopt the rmrr rule 
at this time dp l is unable to determine the timing of this adoption 
in september  the usepa issued a final rule requiring states to modify their state implementation plans sips under the caa 
on july   the ohio epa adopted rules that constitute ohio s nox sip  which is substantially similar to the federal caa section rulemaking and federal nox sip 
on august   usepa published its conditional approval of ohio s nox sip  with an effective date of september  ohio s sip requires nox reductions at coal fired generating units effective may  in order to meet these nox requirements  dp l s capital expenditures for the installation of selective catalytic reduction scr equipment are estimated to total approximately million  of which million has been invested through december  on may   dp l began operation of its scrs 
dp l s nox reduction strategy and associated expenditures to meet the federal reduction requirements should satisfy the ohio sip nox reduction requirements 
on december   the usepa proposed the interstate air quality rule iaqr designed to reduce and permanently cap sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from electric utilities 
the proposed iaqr focuses on states  including ohio  whose power plant emissions are believed to be significantly contributing to fine particle and ozone pollution in other downwind states in the eastern united states 
on june   the usepa issued a supplemental proposal to the iaqr  now renamed as the clean air interstate rule cair 
until final rules are published  dp l cannot determine the effect of the proposed rules on dp l s operations 
on january   the usepa published its proposal to restrict mercury and other air toxics from coal fired and oil fired utility plants 
dp l is reviewing the various proposed options and the impact of each option 
until final rules are published  dp l cannot determine the effect of the proposed rules on dp l s operations 
under the proposed cap and trade options for so and nox  as well as mercury  dp l estimates it will spend more than million from through to install the necessary pollution controls 
plant specific mercury controls may result in higher costs 
due to the uncertainties associated with the proposed requirements  dp l cannot project the final costs at this time 
on july   the ohio epa submitted to the usepa its recommendations for eight hour ozone nonattainment boundaries for the metropolitan areas within ohio 
on april   the usepa issued its list of ozone nonattainment designations 
dp l owns and or operates a number of facilities in counties designated as nonattainment with the ozone national ambient air quality standard 
dp l does not know at this time what future regulations may be imposed on its facilities and will closely monitor the regulatory process 
following the final designation of the nonattainment areas  the ohio epa will have three years to develop regulations to attain and maintain compliance with the eight hour ozone national ambient air quality standard 
the iaqr cair addresses harmonization with these issues 
it is expected that the ohio epa will revise its sip consistent with the iaqr cair when these rules are finalized 
on february   ohio epa submitted to usepa its recommended particulate matter pm designations 
this recommendation included counties in which dp l operates and or owns generating facilities 
usepa notified ohio epa on june  that it intended to include additional counties as nonattainment for pm  primarily those adjacent counties with power plants 
ohio epa commented to usepa on august   opposing the expansion of the nonattainment boundaries 
usepa intends to finalize the nonattainment designations by early following the final designation of the nonattainment areas  the ohio epa will have three years to develop regulations to attain and maintain compliance with the pm national ambient air quality standard 
dp l cannot determine the effect such regulations will have on its operations 
in april  the usepa issued proposed rules governing existing facilities that have cooling water intake structures 
final rules were published in the federal register on july  dp l anticipates that future studies may be needed at certain generating facilities 
dp l cannot predict the impact such studies may have on future operations 
on march   the usepa issued final national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants for stationary combustion turbines 
the effect of the final standards on dpl s operations is not expected to be material 
on july   usepa finalized  but has not yet published  rules that remove four subcategories of new combustion turbines from regulation under the hazardous air pollutant regulations 
on april   the usepa issued proposed final rules for standards of performance for stationary gas turbines 
on may   the usepa withdrew the direct final rules 
the final rules were reissued on july  on may   the usepa issued its proposed regional haze rule  which addresses how states should determine best available retrofit technology bart for sources covered under the regional haze rule 
the proposal gives states three options for determining which sources should be subject to bart and provides guidelines for states on conducting the technical analysis of possible controls as bart 
the proposal is being issued to respond to the dc circuit s remand of the regional haze rule in american corn growers association v 
usepa  f 
d dc cir 
 in which the court told the usepa that the bart determination has to include analysis of the degree of visibility improvement resulting from the use of control technology at each source subject to bart and that the usepa could not mandate that states follow a collective contribution approach to determine whether sources in the state could reasonably be anticipated to contribute to visibility impairment in a class i area 
dp l is reviewing the proposed rule to determine the impact on any of its facilities 
the usepa  in its june  supplemental cair  has proposed that bart eligible electric generating units egus may be exempted from bart if the state complies with the cair requirements through the adoption of the cair cap and trade program for soand nox emissions 
if ohio adopts such a program  bart will not require any additional reductions 
on may   the ohio epa issued a final national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit for jm stuart station that continues the station s a variance 
during the three year term of the draft permit  dp l will conduct a thermal discharge study to evaluate the technical feasibility and economic reasonableness of water cooling methods other than cooling towers 
land use dp l and numerous other parties have been notified by the usepa or the ohio epa that they are potentially responsible parties prps for clean up at three superfund sites in ohio the north sanitary aka valleycrest landfill in dayton  ohio  the tremont city landfill in springfield  ohio  and the south dayton dump landfill site in dayton  ohio 
dp l and numerous other parties received notification from the ohio epa on july  that it considers them prps for clean up of hazardous substances at the north sanitary landfill site 
dp l has not joined the prp group formed for the site because the available information does not demonstrate that dp l contributed hazardous substances to the site 
in addition  at this time the ohio epa has not provided an estimated cost of clean up for this site 
in october  the prp group brought an action against dp l and numerous other parties alleging that they are prps that should be liable for a portion of clean up costs at the site 
while dp l does not believe it disposed of any hazardous substances at this site  on august   dp l entered into a settlement agreement with the prps for its alleged liability for the amount of thousand which is now final and has been approved by the united states district court  western division of the ohio southern district 
dp l and numerous other parties received notification from the usepa in january that it considers them prps for the tremont city landfill site 
the information available to dp l does not demonstrate that dp l contributed any hazardous substances to the site 
dp l plans to vigorously challenge this action 
in september  dp l and other parties received a special notice that the usepa considers them to be prps for the clean up of hazardous substances at the south dayton dump landfill site 
the information available to dp l does not demonstrate that dp l contributed hazardous substances to the site 
the usepa seeks recovery of past costs and funding for a remedial investigation and feasibility study 
the usepa has not provided an estimated clean up cost for this site 
should the usepa pursue such action  dp l will vigorously challenge it
