item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
since northfield s incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of our potential product  polyheme 
we have incurred operating losses during each year of our operations since inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for the next several years 
from northfield s inception through may   we have incurred operating losses totaling we will be required to complete our pivotal phase iii prehospital trial and obtain fda regulatory approval before polyheme can be sold commercially 
the fda regulatory process is subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those described above under risk factors 
we therefore cannot at this time reasonably estimate the timing of any future revenues from the commercial sale of polyheme 
the costs incurred by northfield to date and during each period presented below in connection with our development of polyheme are described in the statements of operations included in this report and in note of the notes to our financial statements 
our success will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain fda regulatory approval of polyheme and our manufacturing facilities  obtain sufficient quantities of blood to manufacture polyheme in commercial quantities  manufacture and distribute polyheme in a cost effective manner  enforce our patent positions and raise sufficient capital to fund these activities 
we have experienced significant delays in the development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve these goals or that we will be able to realize product revenues or profitability on a sustained basis or at all 
results of operations we reported no revenues for the fiscal years ended may   or from northfield s inception through may   we have reported total revenues of  all of which were derived from licensing fees 
operating expenses operating expenses for our fiscal years ended may   and totaled   and  respectively 
measured on a percentage basis  fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by  while fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by during fiscal  research and development expenses totaled  an increase of  or  from fiscal expenses of  during fiscal  we began enrolling patients in our pivotal phase iii prehospital trial 
in december  the first trial site was initiated and by may  the number of sites enrolling patients had grown to the expense of site training  initiation and monitoring along with patient study costs are the sources of the increased costs 
we anticipate and are planning for significant increases in research and development spending in fiscal available funding is being used to add new clinical sites and expand patient enrollment 
support for this effort will include increased patient monitoring  expanded laboratory analyses  sophisticated data analysis and the manufacture of additional units of polyheme 
we are also expending considerable effort and resources in reviewing  and modifying when necessary  all current plant operations in anticipation of a required fda pre approval inspection 
for our fiscal year  research and development expenses totaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the prior fiscal year 
during  lower clinical trials expense was partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses as we stocked polyheme for our current clinical trial 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended may   totaled  an increase of  or  from the expenses incurred in the comparable prior year period 
during our fiscal year  we pursued significant administrative initiatives to expand and further protect our intellectual property portfolio and to conduct market research on the commercial potential of polyheme 
expenses in connection with these initiatives accounted for all of the increases in fiscal while we have begun the process of planning for commercialization of polyheme  our priority and focus remain centered on successfully executing our pivotal phase iii prehospital trial 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended may   totaled  compared to expenses of  for the year ended may   representing an increase of  or 
the increase was due primarily to costs associated with a proxy contest in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders  as well as costs associated with our increased public relations focus 
we anticipate modest increases in general and administrative expenses in fiscal business taxes based on the capitalization of the company will increase by more than  in fiscal as a result of our successful fundraising efforts in fiscal we also anticipate increased expenses related to the development of a new web site and expansion of business development activities 
we anticipate no other significant administrative initiatives in fiscal interest income interest income in fiscal equaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the  in interest income reported in fiscal lower available investment balances and lower interest rates caused the decrease 
interest income in fiscal equaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the  in interest income reported in fiscal significantly lower interest rates and lower available investment balances accounted for the decrease 
following our successful fundraising efforts in fiscal  we now anticipate interest income will increase substantially in fiscal interest rates  however  for short term high grade investments remain at historically low levels 
current money market rates range between 
and and one year investments yield in the range 
we remain invested at the short end of the yield curve with modest expectations for yield improvement over the course of the year 
a rate increase yields  in additional interest income on a  investment over a month period 
net loss the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increased net loss was primarily due to higher research and development costs associated with our pivotal phase iii prehospital trial 
the net loss per share was the same for both fiscal years because the average number of shares outstanding in the current fiscal year increased as a result of our recent fundraising efforts and diluted the increased dollar loss in the current fiscal year 
the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increase in the loss per share for fiscal was primarily the result of the reduction in interest income  expenses relating to our annual meeting of stockholders and increased professional services 
liquidity and capital resources from northfield s inception through may   we have used cash in operating activities and for the purchase of property  plant  equipment and engineering services in the amount of  for the fiscal years ended may   and  these cash expenditures totaled   and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in cash utilization is due primarily to expenses related to our pivotal phase iii prehospital trial 
we have financed our research and development and other activities to date through the public and private sale of equity securities and  to a more limited extent  through the license of product rights 
as of may   we had cash and marketable securities totaling  we believe our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our operating capital requirements  including the expenses we expect will be incurred in connection with our pivotal phase iii prehospital trial and the operation of our existing manufacturing plant and office facilities  for approximately the next to months 
thereafter  we will require substantial additional funding to continue our operations 
we may issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into collaborative arrangements with strategic partners  which could provide us with additional funding or absorb expenses we would otherwise be required to pay 
we are also pursuing potential sources of government funding 
any one or a combination of these sources may be utilized to raise additional capital 
we believe our ability to raise additional capital or enter into a collaborative arrangement with a strategic partner will depend primarily on the results of our clinical trial  as well as general conditions in the business and financial markets 
our inability to raise sufficient levels of capital could materially delay or prevent the commercialization of polyheme  even if it is approved by fda 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those now anticipated because of the timing and results of our clinical testing of polyheme  the establishment of relationships with strategic partners  changes in the scale  timing or cost of our commercial manufacturing facility  competitive and technological advances  the fda regulatory process  changes in our marketing and distribution strategy and other factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we believe the following critical accounting policy reflects our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
net deferred tax assets valuation we record our net deferred tax assets in the amount that we expect to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of our valuation  assumptions and estimates are required  such as northfield s ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event we were to determine that it was more likely than not we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their carrying value  an adjustment to recognize the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of may   we have recorded a percent valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  less than contractual cash obligations total one year years years years lease obligations      other obligations    total contractual cash obligations      the lease for our evanston headquarters is cancelable with six months notice combined with a termination payment equal to six months base rent 
at may   this penalty would have amounted to  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we currently do not have any foreign currency exchange risk 
we may invest our cash and cash equivalents in government agency securities  corporate debt  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that the financial market risk exposure is not material 
a one percentage point decrease on our cash and marketable securities balance of million at may   would decrease annual interest income by
