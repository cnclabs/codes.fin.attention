table of contents overview we are a technology company providing individual animal tracking  food safety and supply procurement services to the beef production industry 
our mission is to enable the delivery of a large  brandable supply of beef that differentiates the products  opens new markets  and creates new value for the industry and consumers 
the company is structured into two operating groups  food safety technologies fst and animal information solutions ais 
historical from may through january  we acquired thirteen cattle brokerage companies with the aim of increasing our presence and market share within the cattle industry 
through these acquisitions  we significantly increased our capacity to market cattle throughout the united states 
following these acquisitions  the cattle industry experienced difficulties due to an extended drought in the southern plains and the southeast  which led to a decrease in the availability of feeder cattle for sale  which led to a significantly reduced number of head sold in each quarter in in the fourth quarter of  we completed lease and operating agreements with three of our largest order buying facilities in order to reduce the working capital requirements for our owned operations 
in and  under new management  we began to focus our efforts on our two business groups  ais and fst 
accordingly  a series of restructurings occurred in an effort to fund our operations from existing cash flows 
during the second quarter of  we determined that in order to improve our productivity and our use of working capital we would sell or dispose of all of our previously acquired cattle operations 
during the second half of  we aggressively divested ourselves of these cattle operations and as of january   completed the divestiture of all our cattle operations 
with the completion of these divestitures  we significantly changed our market focus and revenue source 
how we operate within our two business segments we have spent most of the past three years in research and development and commercialization 
we have completed the development of cattlelog and both the verifeye solo and cis units 
we are now in the process of expanding market acceptance of these products  as well as increasing our product offerings through continued research and development 
going forward  our focus in the fst group is gaining industry wide adoption of our current solo and cis products  as well as completing the commercialization of nerve tissue  pork and hand hygiene products 
currently  we have established a relationship with excel  who has adopted both the cis and solo products to enhance their food safety program 
to be successful in meeting our sales goals  we will need to establish relationships with the other top five packers during the next several years 
we are currently in discussions with several of these top packers  and hope to complete formal agreements with them in the near future 
there are approximately beef processors in the us who  we believe  would benefit from adoption of the solo as an addition to their current food safety process 
with our limited staff  we are unable to adequately cover all of these beef processors 
to enhance our ability to market the solo we are in the process of securing a distribution agreement with a us distributor 
as a result of legislative changes  particularly with country of origin labeling cool  our ais group turned its attention to achieving usda pvp certification for cattlelog 
in january  cattlelog was the first animal tracking solution to receive this certification 
this usda program involved a comprehensive approval process  which began in june  and provides independent verification that our policies and procedures are designed to ensure the integrity and security of the data collected with our systems 
cattlelog is designed to be a key tool that allows our customers  from small operators to commercial feedlots  to track and identify animals through the supply chain at a time of growing need 
as evidenced by the recent discovery of bse in the us  cattle identification and tracking are priority issues to the us beef industry and interest in our cattlelog individual id product has increased significantly 
one 
table of contents example of this increased interest is the contract reached with adm alliance nutrition ani  a wholly owned subsidiary of archer daniels midland adm in january  in which ani selected our cattlelog individual animal data collection and reporting system to manage their electronic data collection and analysis and information exchange efforts 
ani  a leading supplier of livestock feeds  will offer the cattlelog program to cattle producers who purchase ani s feed and feed supplements 
in addition  this contract has resulted in other significant industry participants expressing interest in similar programs 
we are hopeful we will have similar agreements reached soon 
the us government is motivated to establish a regulated  mandatory identification and tracking program 
the establishment of these final regulations could impact the timing of revenue for the ais group because the government could choose from several methods of data collection and maintenance including the government maintains the entire database  in which case  cattlelog could be used for electronic data collection only  the government designates third parties to collect and store the data  in which case  cattlelog could be one of the third party providers  or the government names a single third party to collect and store the data  in which case  unless cattlelog is the single provider  our sales would likely decrease 
we do not believe this option is likely to occur 
in addition to the government s push for a mandatory identification program  beef retailers are exerting pressure on the beef industry to have traceability for all beef sold 
these beef retailers include large grocery stores and restaurant chains  particularly fast food chains 
if these retailers decide to require traceability in the near future for their meat purchases  as some  including mcdonalds  have indicated they prefer  we believe the speed of industry wide adoption will be greatly enhanced 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance going forward  sales growth will be our best indicator of success 
we believe that increased sales volume will be required to permit the company to be self sustaining in terms of a regular and positive cash flow from operations 
the volatility faced by our customers  due to the reduction in beef exports after the discovery of bse in the us beef markets  will be reflected in greater unpredictability of our own sales 
inquiry into our products has increased since the bse announcement  but capturing this potential growth will rely on the industry s willingness to adopt these new technologies in order to prevent or minimize the effects of a second bse case 
our currently available cattlelog technology can help producers source verify their product  which can significantly reduce the time and cost of tracing both the source of an infected animal and other potentially infected animals 
in addition  we are developing verifeye applications to aid users in the detection of central nervous tissue  which would aid in keeping potential bse contamination out of finished beef products 
one event which would have a significant effect on our sales growth is the selection of our cattlelog individual animal data collection and reporting system by other name brand companies  in addition to adm  to manage their electronic data collection and analysis and information exchange efforts 
a second event significant to our anticipated sales growth will be the adoption of our cis food safety technology by one or more of the other top five packers 
a third event significant to our anticipated sales growth will be the completion of products  which apply the verifeye technology to hand hygiene  pork and neural tissue applications  for commercialization 
we continue to aggressively seek relationships with both brand name companies who may select cattlelog and the top five packers who may adopt the cis technology 
these entities are key to both our success and to the beef industry 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in january  we completed a private equity placement of common stock  additional investment rights and warrants  receiving million in cash 
in addition  we have reduced our quarterly loss from continuing operations to approximately million  which for the quarter ended december   includes  of depreciation 
sales increases are expected to be the most important source of future reduction in cash outflow 
we expect that our existing cash balances  working capital and expected sales of our products and services  including the receipt of million in accelerated lease payments from excel  will meet our cash flow needs for the next twelve months 
however  if sales from our products and services do not meet our expectations in  we may need to seek additional sources of liquidity 
if required  we will continue to explore the need for other debt or equity financing alternatives to meet our working capital requirements 
if additional funds are raised through alternative debt financing that provides for the issuance of equity securities or through the issuance of equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any additional funding will be available when needed  or that if available  such financing will include favorable terms

sources and uses of cash as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million compared to million at december  our working capital balance as of december  was  compared to million as of december  with the addition of the million in private equity funding  our cash and cash equivalents as of february  is million and our working capital balance is million 
as of december   we have a receivable from eastern livestock  llc in the amount of  to be paid in one installment on august  in compliance with the asset purchase agreement for the assets of eastern that we entered into in july we have had significant negative cash flows from operating activities for each fiscal and quarterly period to date 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in in  cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of net operating losses offset by depreciation  increase in fair value of common stock warrants  decreases in trade accounts receivable and increases in advance payments from customers  offset by an increase in inventories

our investing activities in included additional acquisition costs paid in compliance with earn out agreements in the asset purchase agreements executed in january for runnells peters and pennell for a combined cash payment of  in addition  we had capital expenditures of  and executed a note receivable from a related party of million 
these payments and receivables were offset by million provided by the sale of assets associated with the divestiture of six of our cattle operations during and  provided by the sale of our investment in turnkey computer systems  inc in december net cash provided by used in financing activities was million for  million in and million for our financing activities in consisted primarily of a private equity placement  which resulted in proceeds of million 
in addition  we received  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
of the million of net cash used in financing activities in  million was used by the leased operations  principally due to net repayments on the lines of credit held by these leased operations upon completion of the divestitures of these operations 
in disposing of the leased cattle operations  we made a 
table of contents distribution of  representing the lessee operators minority interest 
in addition  we made  in capital lease payments related to the owned operations 
our future working capital requirements will depend on a variety of factors including our ability to successfully implement our current business plan and reduce our net cash outflow 
commercial and contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations  which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease commitments capital lease obligation advance payments from customers total contractual obligations as of march   we reached an agreement with cisco to settle this capital lease obligation for a lump sum payment of  and the return of leased equipment with a current book value of  this settlement will result in miscellaneous other income of approximately  in the first quarter of general inflation has not had a significant impact on our business and it is not expected to have a major impact in the foreseeable future 
other matters we are not engaged in off balance sheet arrangements or trading activities that involve non exchange traded contracts 
during the year ended december   we engaged in a limited number of cattle futures contracts 
as of december   we held in open cattle future positions 
we also engaged in both cattle purchase and sale transactions with certain related parties  primarily entities related to or owned by acquired companies 
these sales were made on the same credit terms as our other customers and suppliers 
we generally purchased from or sold to related parties in order to satisfy sales commitments or balance our inventory position 
purchase and sales prices were negotiated based on current market conditions in the cattle industry 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to an increase in revenues from the sale of verifeye solo units and the introduction of revenues from the lease of a verifeye cis unit for the period from september  through december  this increase is partially offset by a change in marketing strategy for electronic 
table of contents identification eid tags in the second quarter of contributed  in revenues in compared to  in  the nonrenewal of a feedyard data management service contract in the first quarter of contributed  in revenues in compared to in and the discontinuation of the sale of web advertising at the end of contributed  in revenues in compared to in 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the direct cost to manufacture verifeye solo units  depreciation on the verifeye cis units  royalties on the verifeye products and the indirect overhead costs  such as support personnel  facilities costs  telecommunication charges and material purchases that are associated with supporting both our verifeye food safety systems  cattlelog individual animal tracking and database management services 
cost of revenue decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is due principally to the reduction in costs for eid tags from the prior year  which contributed costs of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  in addition  indirect overhead costs  such as support personnel  facilities costs  telecommunication charges and material purchases were reduced by approximately  in the current year 
these decreases in cost of revenues were offset by the costs associated with the sale of verifeye solo units and depreciation on the verifeye cis unit in the current year 
we generated a gross profit of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit is due primarily to the increase in both verifeye solo and verifeye cis revenues  which consist of higher margin technology products and services and a decrease in sales of eid tags  which typically generate lower profit margins  as well as the decrease in indirect overhead costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs  insurance program charges  material and supply purchases  professional service fees  communication  travel  consulting  advertising and media expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily associated with the cost savings initiatives that have been implemented over the last two years and include decreases in salaries and wages  communications  travel  advertising and media expenses 
management has implemented significant restructuring efforts over the last two years to resize the business to focus on the verifeye and ais business models 
we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses to remain fairly stable over the coming year 
technology and development our technology and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs  payments to outside consultants  software purchases and maintenance charges and project materials and supplies 
our expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily associated with the reduction of workforce and decreases in consulting  materials and supplies and facilities expenses 
furthermore  the company has fewer products under development and products such as cattlelog  our exclusive individual animal data collection and reporting system and both verifeye solo  our handheld meat inspection system  are essentially complete 
during the current year  the primary focus of our development team was our verifeye cis and other derivative verifeye products 
we expect to continue to incur costs to develop and commercialize new products  expand our offerings and adapt our technologies to new markets 
as we continue to expand verifeye technology for pork and human health applications  these costs are expected to increase

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to select appropriate accounting policies  and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which the company s financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting principles identified relate to revenue recognition  long lived assets  and accounting for obligations and instruments potentially to be settled in the company s stock 
these critical accounting policies and the company s other significant accounting policies are further disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues from the sale of all ais products and services are recognized as products are shipped or services are provided 
we recognize revenues from the sale of hand held verifeye solo units using the revenue recognition principles of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
these principles provide that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangements meet the following criteria the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a right of return  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
in addition  these principles provide that arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the amount allocated to the delivered item s is limited to that amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting specified performance conditions 
finally  these principles provide that applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting 
food safety product sales are reviewed by management to determine the separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenues among these units of accounting 
revenue allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as products are shipped or services are provided 
revenues from operating leases of verifeye cis units are reported on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted as of january  this statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
under sfas no 
 long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are classified as held for sale when six specific criteria are met 
assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill is included in an asset group when the asset group is or includes a reporting unit 
the results of operations of a component of an entity that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale is reported in discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can clearly be distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of an entity 
in the period in which a component of an entity has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale  the income statement for current and prior periods report the results of operations of the component  including any gain or loss resulting from adjustments to fair value  in discontinued operations 
assets not meeting the criteria of held for sale  continue to be classified as held and used until they are disposed of 
impairment losses for assets held and used are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset asset group exceeds its fair value and are included in continuing operations 
during the second quarter of  we determined that we would sell or close all the remaining owned cattle operations 
in connection with the determination to divest these operations and pursuant to sfas no 
 we evaluated the fair value of the long lived assets  including intangibles of our cattle operations 
the assets of the operations  which were liquidated or sold  were adjusted to the estimated fair value and both the write down of these assets and the results of operations for these businesses are included in discontinued operations 
accounting for obligations and instruments potentially to be settled in the company s stock we account for obligations and instruments potentially to be settled in the company s stock in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock 
this issue addresses the initial balance sheet classification and measurement of contracts that are indexed to  and potentially settled in  the company s own stock 
under eitf contracts are initially classified as equity or as either assets or liabilities  in the following situations equity contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement  and contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in its own shares physical settlement or net share settlement  assuming that all the criteria for equity classification have been met 
assets or liabilities contracts that require net cash settlement including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the company  and contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares physical settlement or net share settlement 

table of contents all contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently accounted for based on the current classification 
contracts initially classified as equity do not recognize subsequent changes in fair value as long as the contracts continue to be classified as equity 
for contracts classified as assets or liabilities  we report changes in fair value in earnings and disclose these changes in the financial statements as long as the contracts remain classified as assets or liabilities 
if contracts classified as assets or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares  any previously reported gains or losses on those contracts continue to be included in earnings 
the classification of a contract is reassessed at each balance sheet date 
in november  we issued  shares of common stock for per share and warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  with an exercise price of per share  in a private placement transaction  raising gross proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants are exercisable immediately and expire november  in accordance with eitf and the terms of the warrants  the fair value of the warrants has been accounted for as a liability  with an offsetting reduction to the carrying value of the common stock 
subsequent changes in fair value are reflected in the statement of operations 
upon exercise  the warrants will be reclassified to stockholders equity 
the fair value of the warrants at date of issuance was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated to be  on the closing date of the transaction 
the fair value of the warrants was then re measured as of december  and was estimated to be  the increase in the fair value of  from the transaction date to december  was recorded as a charge to other expenses in the statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants increased by approximately  from december  to march  and such increase will be reflected as a charge to other expenses in the statement of operations in the first quarter of

these statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements  including the acceptance by our customers of our products and use of the internet in connection with our beef supply chain management services  our ability to grow revenue  our ability to increase margins  the impact of competition on pricing  general economic conditions  employee turnover  the impact of litigation and other factors 
other factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in factors affecting our business  financial condition and results of operation  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report and as set forth from time to time in our other public filings and public statements 
readers of this report are cautioned to consider these risks and uncertainties and to not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
in addition to the other information included in this report and our other public filings and releases  the following factors should be considered while evaluating our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects we have a history of net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the next year 
if we continue to incur net losses  our business may not ultimately be financially viable 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
we reported a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  and a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december   or of total revenue 
as of december   we had accumulated net losses totaling approximately million 
our revenue may not grow as anticipated and  as a result  our financial condition and results of our operations may be harmed and our business may not be financially viable in the future 
to achieve profitability  we must successfully address the following risks while maintaining or growing our profit margins lack of wide scale commercial acceptance of our products and services  lack of wide scale sales and distribution channels for our products and services  failure to introduce new products and services  inability to respond promptly to competitive and industry developments  failure to achieve brand recognition  and failure to upgrade and enhance our technologies to accommodate expanded product and service offerings and increased customer demand 
we have recently raised million of equity capital to support operations 
however  the operating plans and financial projections may not be fully achieved 
if our projections are not met  we may need to either raise debt or equity capital or further reduce operating costs to maintain a sufficient cash balances 
we expect cash balances will be sufficient to operate throughout fiscal should we find it necessary to raise additional funds  we may find that such funds are either not 
table of contents available or are available only on terms that are unattractive due to cost or dilution of existing shareholders interest  or both 
in the event that we find it necessary to raise additional funds to sustain operations and we are unable to do so  we may need to take such actions as additional restructuring of operations to reduce costs or discontinue a line of business 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business may be harmed 
our two business segments are difficult to evaluate because they have a limited operating history 
although we were formed in  our current product and service offerings have a very limited operating history 
recently  we have focused our strategy on providing food safety and supply management services 
during  the products of our fst segment have begun providing us with revenue 
we have sold solo units throughout the us and have distributors in five foreign countries 
we have installed our first cis unit at an excel beef plant  we have shipped two additional units and plans are underway to install cis units in each of excel s four remaining north american beef plants 
we are in discussion with other large beef processors and hopeful that additional cis units will be installed in  but we have no written agreements 
in  the revenues from products and services of our ais segment have decreased from prior years  due primarily to changes in products and segment direction 
if we are unable to expand the market for the products and services of both our fst segment and our ais segment  or if any of our products do not perform as we expect them to  our results of operations and prospects will be materially and adversely impacted 
our business may be harmed by competitors 
in the event the demand for food safety technology increases in the future  or if governmental agencies mandate compliance with certain food safety technology or procedures  we may face competition from companies that may develop competing technologies or services 
because the market for beef production consists primarily of a number of large producers  it is possible that these competing technologies or services will be created by companies with significantly greater resources than ours 
in the event we are unable to effectively compete with these new technologies or services  our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted 
our ability to develop new products is uncertain and our products may not develop as we anticipate 
the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of developing new products is inherently uncertain 
prospective products  such as our meat inspection system  require time and resources to develop  may not ultimately be commercially viable  may not achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace and may fail to receive regulatory approval  if required 
in addition  new products by competitors could adversely affect the realization of products that are commercially successful 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law and confidentiality agreements with third parties 
we cannot guarantee that any of our pending patent or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  the patents or trademarks may be challenged by other parties or invalidated 
because brand recognition is an important component of our business strategy  the protection of our trademarks is critical to our success 
in addition  we depend upon our proprietary database of industry and client information to provide our clients with our information services 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products and technology or obtain access to our confidential proprietary database 
other parties may also breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts 
we may not become aware of these breaches or have adequate remedies available 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trademark protection may be unavailable in certain countries to which we might expand our operations 

table of contents we are also reliant on our exclusive licensing arrangement with iowa state university and the agricultural research service 
if we breach this agreement  our rights to the technology incorporated into our food safety products could be limited or eliminated  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in technology markets  there is generally frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims that we infringe third party proprietary rights 
while we are not aware of any patents  copyrights or other rights that would prevent us from manufacturing and commercializing our products or services in the united states and abroad  there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
there also can be no assurance that former employers of our present and future employees will not claim that our employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of our personnel 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we expect that our revenue and operating results will vary in the future as a result of a number of factors 
our quarterly results of operations may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results in the future may not follow any prior trends and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results 
the factors that affect our quarterly operating results include our ability to generate revenues and profits in our two business groups  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by us  continued purchases by our existing customers  and our ability to manage our costs 
in addition  a number of factors that are beyond our control will also affect our quarterly operating results  such as demand for our products and services  product and price competition  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by our competitors  and significant downturns in our targeted markets 
our common stock price historically has been volatile  which may make it difficult for investors to resell common stock at prices they find attractive 
the market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile 
any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may be caused by factors such as actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  conditions or trends in the cattle industry  new sales formats of new products or services  changes in or failure by us to meet financial estimates of securities analysts  
table of contents announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  capital commitments  and sales of common stock 
safeguard scientifics  inc controls a substantial portion of our stock and may influence our affairs 
as of march   safeguard scientifics  inc safeguard has the power to vote approximately of the aggregate number of votes to which the holders of our common stock are entitled 
in addition  currently two of the seven members of our board of directors are also officers of safeguard 
safeguard may  therefore  have the ability to significantly influence our management and matters requiring stockholder approval 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we held no derivative securities as of december  our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and their potential impact on our investment portfolio 
we invest in marketable debt securities that meet high credit quality standards and limit our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our investments consisted of  in a certificate of deposit with a remaining maturity of months 
due to the small size  and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or the fair value of our portfolio 
the impact on our future results of operations and the future value of our portfolio will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments
