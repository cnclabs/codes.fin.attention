item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview harken is engaged in oil and gas exploration  exploitation  development and production operations both domestically and internationally through its various subsidiaries 
harken divides its operations into two operating segments  which are managed and evaluated as separate operations 
harken s north american operating segment presently consists of harken s exploration  exploitation  development  production and acquisition efforts in the united states 
substantially all of harken s north american operations currently include those activities in the onshore and offshore gulf coast regions of south texas and louisiana 
harken also has oil and gas properties located in the western and panhandle regions of texas 
harken s middle american operations currently include global s activities in colombia  panama and peru 
although global owns an interest in approximately million acres in costa rica  harken believes that political and judicial developments has severely limited the opportunity for future oil and gas development in that country 
all of the middle american operating revenues during have been generated from colombian operations 
during  harken focused on reducing its significant debt obligations  consisting primarily of the european notes and the benz convertible notes which were scheduled to mature in may and november  respectively 
under its capital restructuring plan  as described below under liquidity and capital resources  harken s management effected the repurchase  redemption and or restructuring of certain of its outstanding debt obligations prior to their maturity date 
also  certain convertible debt obligations were either converted into or redeemed with harken common stock  under the terms of the specific note agreements  either prior to or upon the maturity date 
since january  and as of march   harken has reduced its overall outstanding debt principal amounts by  or approximately million  as compared to the outstanding debt principal amounts as of december  in the first quarter of  harken established gulf energy management  inc gem  a wholly owned subsidiary  to manage its domestic operations held through its other domestic wholly owned subsidiaries 
harken s north american operating segment has experienced successful drilling activity over the past three fiscal years  with an average success completion rate of approximately and an average historical finding cost of approximately per million cubic foot equivalent 
however  during  harken minimized its drilling activity in order to conserve capital resources to reduce convertible debt obligations pursuant to the capital restructuring plan 
in may  harken retained petrie parkman and co  inc to evaluate its domestic oil and gas assets and to make recommendations to maximize their value 
following the conclusion of petrie parkman and co  inc s evaluation and in december  harken sold the majority of its oil and gas properties located in the panhandle region of texas for a gross sales price of approximately million  subject to certain adjustments 
harken considered the panhandle assets to be non core assets since the majority of harken s domestic reserves and productions were located along the gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana 
harken s gulf coast assets are primarily natural gas 
in december  harken used approximately million of the panhandle asset sales proceeds to repay all outstanding principal and interest under  and terminate  harken s credit facility with guaranty bank fsb 

table of contents harken s middle american operations are conducted through its ownership in global  a public limited company registered in england and wales under the companies act of the united kingdom with its ordinary shares admitted for trading on the aim exchange in london 
in  harken s ownership in global decreased from to 
see note middle american operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item for further discussion 
all of the middle american operating revenues during have been generated from global s colombian operations 
these revenues have increased from the comparable period last year due to higher commodity prices  which were partially offset by lower production volumes 
during  harken is concentrating on the development and growth of north american and middle american oil and gas assets and energy based growth opportunities 
in january  harken s board of directors approved the capital expenditure budget of approximately million  a increase in capital expenditures as compared to of the budget  approximately million is allocated to north american capital expenditures and approximately million is allocated to middle american capital expenditures 
harken expects to fund these capital expenditures through available cash on hand and through projected cash flow from operations in possible weakening commodity prices  a decline in drilling success or substantial delays in bringing on production from wells drilled could cause harken to reduce its drilling plans 
the majority of harken s planned capital expenditures for are discretionary  and as a result  will be curtailed if sufficient funds are not available 
the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices has a significant impact on the profitability of harken s oil and gas operations 
overall  the oil and gas industry benefited from increased oil and gas commodity prices in helping to generate improved industry cash flows from operations 
worldwide crude oil inventories during were low compared to average inventories over the last ten years 
these lower worldwide crude oil inventories helped contribute to higher crude oil prices as compared to average crude oil prices over the past several years 
opec restrained marginal international oil supplies in thereby preventing the growth in oil inventories 
geopolitical disruptions to the international supply of oil occurred in nigeria  venezuela and iraq 
both venezuela and iraq had not returned to their average production levels by the end of worldwide demand for oil and gas increased in in response to improving worldwide economic conditions 
worldwide natural gas inventories in were slightly above the five year average  but improved demand for natural gas helped contribute to higher natural gas prices in as compared to average natural gas prices over the past several years 
industry wide oil and gas drilling activity increased domestically and abroad in in response to improved industry cash flows from operations 
critical accounting policies full cost accounting method harken accounts for the costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production of oil and gas reserves using the full cost accounting method 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties shall not exceed an amount the cost ceiling equal to the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions  including the use of oil and gas prices as of the end of each quarter  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions and the asset retirement obligation 
harken reflected a full cost valuation allowance totaling million as of december   based on nymex prices of barrel and mmbtu 
as of december   global reflected a non cash full cost valuation allowance totaling approximately  for unevaluated costs incurred for specific areas which global no longer intended to pursue under its technical evaluation agreements in peru 
table of contents and panama 
global has no proved reserves in peru and panama 
for a complete discussion of harken s proved oil and gas reserves  see note oil and gas disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item as of december   based on nymex posted prices of per barrel and per mmbtu  harken and global s estimates of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves exceeded their adjusted carrying values 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline in the future  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that impairments of oil and gas properties could occur 
in addition  it is reasonably possible that additional impairments could occur if costs are incurred in excess of any increases in the cost ceiling  revisions to proved oil and gas reserves occur or if properties are sold for proceeds less than the discounted present value of the related proved oil and gas reserves 
a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  harken has included the costs of such mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  harken believes amounts required to be reclassified out of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization and into a separate intangible assets line item would not be material 
harken s cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
colombia operations during the year ended december   approximately of harken s consolidated revenues were generated from global s sales to ecopetrol  the state owned colombian oil company 
the country of colombia is currently experiencing heightened security issues which could affect global s colombian operations as well as the strength and operations of ecopetrol 
if ecopetrol experiences significant adverse conditions in its operations  it may not be able to meet its ongoing financial obligations to global for delivered production or be able to purchase future production under the terms of existing contract provisions 
global s colombian operations could also be directly affected by guerilla activity or other instances or threats of violence  preventing or interrupting global from producing  transporting or delivering future production volumes 
any such adverse developments in global s colombian operations could result in  among other things  additional full cost valuation allowances and impairments related to global s assets 
asset retirement obligations harken has significant obligations for the dismantlement and removal of its oil and gas production and related facilities 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimate and judgments since most the removal activities will occur several years in the future 
in addition  asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental  safety considerations that may ultimately impact the amount of the obligation 
effective january   harken changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires 
table of contents asset retirement costs to be capitalized as part of the cost of the related tangible long lived assets and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the useful life of the asset 
see note asset retirement obligation disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item for discussion of implementation and impact of sfas derivative instruments harken is exposed to risk from fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
to reduce the impact of this risk in earnings and to increase the predictability of its cash flow  from time to time harken enters into certain derivative contracts  primarily collars and floors for a portion of its north american oil and gas operations 
at december   harken holds a natural gas collar contract that was not designated as a hedge under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
harken also holds an oil floor contract  at december   that was designated as a hedge under sfas these commodity derivative instruments are measured at fair value and recorded as assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
when available  quoted market prices are used in determining fair value 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are limited to creditworthy major institutions 
accounting for payment of series g and series g preferred stock dividend liability in common shares harken accounts for the payment of the series g and series g preferred stock dividends with shares of harken common stock as a debt extinguishment in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 extinguishment of debt apb 
accordingly  the difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock dividend liability at december   approximately million  and the fair market value of the shares of harken common stock issued by harken in payment of the liability in january  approximately  is recognized as a payment of preferred stock dividend liability in common shares in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as a million increase  net of income taxes paid on behalf of the preferred shareholders  to net income attributed to common shareholders 
for further discussion of harken s accounting treatment for payment of series g and g preferred stock dividends  see note other information in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item in january and february  harken paid the series g and series g preferred stock dividend liability accrued at december  with  shares of harken common stock 
accordingly  the difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock dividend liability at december   approximately million  and the fair market value of the shares of harken common stock issued by harken in payment of the liability in january and february  approximately  will be recognized as a payment of preferred stock dividend liability in common shares in the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended march  as a million increase to net income attributed to common shareholders 
recent accounting pronouncements during december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of certain entities that are determined to be variable interest entities vie s 
an entity is considered to be a vie when either i the entity lacks sufficient equity to carry on its principal operations  ii the equity owners of the entity cannot make decisions about the entity s activities or iii the entity s equity neither absorbs losses or benefits from gains 
harken owns no interests in variable interest entities  and therefore this new interpretation has not affected harken s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires than an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability or asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise was effective and adopted by harken on july  as harken s series g  series g and series g preferred stock do not qualify as liabilities under sfas no 
 the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on harken s financial condition or results of operations 
a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  harken has included the costs of such mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  harken believes amounts required to be reclassified out of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and into a separate intangible assets line item would not be material 
harken s cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
the rescission of statement no 
requires that gains and losses on extinguishments of debt no longer be presented as extraordinary items in the consolidated statement of operations  commencing in thus  prior periods have been restated in to reflect this change in presentation 
results of operations the historical results section in statement of operations comparisons below present a discussion of harken s consolidated operating results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for the years ended december   and the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of north and middle american oil and gas revenues and operating expenses in segment information below 
the discussion of our segment operating results is presented on an historical basis for the years ended december   and 
table of contents statement of operations comparisons net loss and per share amounts for each of the years in the three year period ended december   were as follows thousands of dollars  except per share amounts net loss net income loss attributed to common stock net income loss per share basic diluted the primary components in harken s net loss for the year ended december  to the net loss for the year ended december  and net loss for the year ended december  to the net loss for the year ended december   are outlined in the table below favorable unfavorable variance thousands of dollars versus versus north american operating profit middle american operating profit general and administrative expenses  net depreciation and amortization full cost valuation allowance provision for asset impairments litigation and contingent liability settlements  net interest expense and other gains from repurchase exchange of european notes income tax expense benefit other cumulative effect of change in accounting principle north american operating profit is calculated as oil and gas revenues less oil and gas operating expenses 
middle american operating profit is calculated as oil and gas revenues less operating expenses  before reduction for minority interest 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million during as compared to the prior year due primarily due to employee reductions during offset by related severance costs 
harken reduced its employee count by  from employees at december  to employees at december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses over prior year period was partially mitigated by increased legal and professional costs in associated with harken s capital restructuring plan 
general and 
table of contents administrative expenses decreased during compared to  due primarily to the personnel and salary reductions in harken reduced the number of its employees by in the decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially mitigated by increased legal and professional costs in associated with harken s capital restructuring plan  as well as the reimbursement in of approximately  of litigation expenses pursuant to harken s insurance coverage related to such litigation 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased during compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased production volumes during the period as a result of production decline on both north and middle american producing properties 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased during compared to the primarily due to decreased production volumes during the year as a result of harken s sales of certain domestic producing properties 
depreciation and amortization on oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit of production basis in accordance with the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
full cost valuation allowances during the fourth quarter of  harken recorded non cash full cost valuation allowances totaling  related to global s peru and panama unevaluated property costs incurred for specific areas which global no longer intended to pursue under its technical evaluation agreements in peru and panama 
global has no proved reserves associated with the peru or panama technical evaluation agreements 
harken did not record any full cost valuation allowances in during the fourth quarter of  due to reduced oil and gas prices at december   harken recorded non cash valuation allowances of approximately million related to its domestic oil and gas properties and million related to its colombian oil properties 
the valuation was based on the present value  discounted at ten percent  of harken proved oil and gas reserves based on year end prices 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline in the future  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that additional impairments of oil and gas properties could occur 
in addition  it is reasonably possible that additional impairments could occur if costs are incurred in excess of any increases in the present value of future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  or if properties are sold for proceeds less than the discounted present value of the related proved oil and gas reserves 
for further discussion  see note oil and gas properties in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item provision for asset impairments during the fourth quarter of  global reflected an impairment of approximately  on certain colombia oilfield equipment consisting of casing and tubing inventory 
based on the low industry demand for such equipment in light of heightened colombia security concerns  the carrying value of such inventory was in excess of estimated future cash flows from the sale or use of such equipment 

table of contents in  harken reflected asset impairments totaling million 
included in asset impairments during were impairments of approximately million related to global s investment in the costa rica project 
also included in asset impairments was approximately million related to certain transportation facility costs related to global s bolivar contract area in colombia  as the carrying value of such facilities was in excess of estimates of future cash flows 
global also reflected an impairment of approximately million related to certain deferred transaction costs incurred  primarily for certain merger transaction efforts which were a part of the restructuring of global s international assets 
in addition  global reflected an impairment of  on certain colombia oilfield equipment because the carrying value of such inventory was in excess of estimated future cash flows from sale or use of such equipment 
litigation and contingent liability settlements during the fourth quarter of  harken accrued and charged to expense million associated with ongoing settlement discussions related to the rice lawsuit

such amount was partially offset by approximately million related to other accrued liabilities that were settled during the second quarter of for amounts less than the amounts previously accrued 
interest expense and other interest expense and other includes the following for each of the years in the three year period ended december  thousands of dollars interest expense on debt instruments amortization of debt issuance costs unrealized holding loss on noit investment other than temporary accretion of asset retirement obligations sfas accretion of asset retirement obligations prior to sfas standby commitment fee rights offering losses on gas collar contract colombian war tax all other interest expense and other decreased during compared to  primarily due to the overall reduction in harken s current and long term debt associated with the capital restructuring plan 
the decrease in 
table of contents interest expense and other was mitigated by harken s expensing of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately  related to the issuance of warrants to purchase global ordinary shares owned by harken  which were issued to lyford in consideration for the investor term loan which was paid in full in march in addition  harken expensed the  of debt issuance costs of a promissory note in the principal amount of  the waverley note issued to waverley investments limited waverley  which was redeemed with cash in full in june in march  harken expensed an unrealized holding loss of  on its investment in shares of new opportunities investment trust plc  as harken believed the decline in market value of those shares was other than temporary 
interest and other expense increased during compared to the increase was partially due to the expensing of approximately  related to the non refundable portion of the september standby commitment fee shares issued to lyford in connection with the rights offering 
the increase was also attributed  in part  to a charge of  related to colombian war taxes recorded during the third quarter of by global

domestic oil and gas production volumes are lower in as compared to due primarily to high decline rates on certain lapeyrouse and lake raccourci wells which reached the end of their productive lives in specific producing zones  along with normal production decline on other producing properties 
capital expenditures to develop the domestic oil and gas assets in were minimized in order to focus capital resources on reducing outstanding debt principal balances 
north american s oil and gas production volumes are expected to continue to decrease initially in early due to the sale of the panhandle properties in december harken s budgeted capital expenditures for for domestic operations are approximately million  a increase in domestic capital expenditures as compared to see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
domestic oil and gas operating expense decreased to approximately million during compared to approximately million during the prior year primarily due to a decrease in oil and gas sales volumes in this decrease was mitigated by increased salt water disposal costs associated with the lake raccourci field in lafourche parish  louisiana  along with increased compressor and chemical treating costs per well

as a result  no amounts remain outstanding under the investor term loan 
harken used the remaining proceeds of the rights offering and the standby commitment in to redeem certain amounts of the european notes 
after giving effect to the consummation of harken s rights offering and lyford s standby commitment  lyford became the holder of approximately of harken s outstanding common stock 
therefore  these transactions resulted in a change of control of harken 
lyford s ownership has been reduced to approximately as of march  due to the conversions of the european notes  the european notes due  certain european notes due  and certain series g  g and g preferred shares into shares of harken common stock

north america commitments under harken s capital expenditure budget  harken s domestic operating strategy includes efforts to increase its oil and gas reserves in north america through acquisitions  exploitation and development drilling activities 
harken anticipates north american capital expenditures will total approximately million during this north american capital expenditure budget focuses on the onshore and offshore gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana 
based in part upon the success of its drilling efforts in the fourth quarter of  the majority of this budgeted capital amount will be used to drill five to seven exploratory and development wells in the lake raccourci and lapeyrouse fields in southern louisiana 
harken currently holds an average working interest in the lake raccourci producing wells of approximately and holds an average working interest of approximately in the lapeyrouse producing wells 
however  harken s planned north american capital expenditures for are discretionary and  as a result  will be curtailed if sufficient funds are not available 
such expenditure curtailments  however  could result in harken losing certain prospect acreage or reducing its interest in future development projects 
middle american commitments global anticipates international capital expenditures will total approximately million during none of these capital expenditures result from commitments under the terms of certain of the association contracts entered into between global s subsidiary harken de colombia  ltd 
and ecopetrol 
these contracts required global to perform certain activities in colombia in accordance with a prescribed timetable 
as of march   global was in compliance with the requirements of each of the association contracts 
in light of the political and judicial developments in costa rica discussed above  global is projecting no capital expenditure plans during with regard to the costa rica contract 
global s planned international capital expenditures for includes approximately million of discretionary expenditures for the development of the alcaravan contract area in colombia  south america 
global expects to drill approximately three development wells in the palo blanco field under the alcaravan contract area with the first of those wells  the estero  to be spud in late march global s discretionary capital expenditures will be curtailed if sufficient funds are not available 
such expenditure curtailments  however  could result in global losing certain prospect acreage or reducing its interest in future development projects 
operational contingencies harken s operations are subject to stringent and complex environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations are subject to changes that may result in more restrictive or costly operations 
failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties or injunctive relief 
global s international oil and gas exploration and production operations  including well drilling and seismic activities  require specific governmental environmental licenses and permits  the acquisition of which in the past have been subject to extensive delays 
global may continue to experience similar delays in the future 
failure to obtain these licenses and permits in a timely manner may prevent or delay harken s and global s operational plans 
effective january   harken changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in accordance with fasb statement no

at december   harken s asset retirement obligation liability was approximately million 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note asset retirement obligation contained in part ii  item  for further discussions

represents the outstanding principal amounts owing under the convertible notes as of december  these obligations are payable or redeemable for cash or with shares of harken common stock see note convertible notes payable in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item for further discussion 
the outstanding principal balance of  plus accrued interest  of the senior secured notes was repaid  in cash in full at a discount  in accordance with the terms of the note agreements  in january the outstanding principal balance of  plus accrued interest  of the convertible notes were converted into harken common stock in february in addition to the above commitments  during and afterward  government authorities under harken s louisiana state leases and operators under harken s other north american operators may also request harken to participate in the cost of drilling additional exploratory and development wells 
harken may fund these future domestic expenditures at its discretion 
further  the cost of drilling or participating in the drilling of any such exploratory and development wells cannot be quantified at this time since the cost will depend on many factors outside of harken s control  such as the timing of the request  the depth of the wells and the location of the property 
harken s discretionary capital expenditures for will be curtailed if harken does not have sufficient funds available 
if harken does not have sufficient funds or otherwise chooses not to participate  it may experience a delay of future cash flows from proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
such expenditure curtailments could also result in harken losing certain prospect acreage or reducing its interest in future development projects 
as of december   harken had no material purchase obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of harken s ongoing business  it does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   harken was not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
adequacy of capital sources and liquidity harken believes it has the ability to provide for its operational needs and its capital program through its projected operating cash flow  partially protected by harken s oil and gas hedging instruments  cash on hand  and its ability to raise capital 
harken s operating cash flow would be adversely affected by declines in oil and natural gas prices  all of which can be volatile 
should projected operating cash flow decline  harken may reduce its capital expenditures program and or consider the issuance of debt  equity and convertible debt instruments  if needed  for utilization for the capital expenditure program 
harken is currently exploring opportunities for possible acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
harken could seek to raise equity or debt financing through the issuance of debt  equity and convertible debt instruments  if needed  for utilization for such acquisition opportunities as they arise 
for further discussion regarding risks associated with acquisitions  see risks factors set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item if harken seeks to raise equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures or other acquisition and development opportunities  those transactions may be affected by the market value of harken common stock 
if the price of harken common stock declines  harken s ability to utilize its stock either directly or indirectly 
table of contents through convertible instruments for raising capital could be negatively affected 
any delisting of harken s common stock would also adversely affect harken s ability to raise capital in the future by issuing common stock or securities convertible into common stock 
further  raising additional funds by issuing common stock or other types of equity securities would further dilute harken s existing stockholders  which dilution could be substantial if the price of harken common stock decreases 
any securities harken issues may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to harken s existing equity securities 
borrowing money may also involve pledging some or all of harken s assets 
no assurance can be given that harken will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  to meet its capital expenditures program or acquisition and development opportunities 
risk factors because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting harken s operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
risk factors associated with harken s financial condition if harken does not continue to meet the listing requirements of the american stock exchange  its common stock could be delisted 
the american stock exchange requires companies to fulfill certain requirements in order for their shares to continue to be listed 
the securities of a company may be considered for delisting if the company fails to meet certain financial thresholds  including if the company has sustained losses from continuing operations and or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years 
as of december   harken has sustained losses in each of harken s last five fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that harken will not report additional losses in the future or that the american stock exchange will not delist harken s common stock 
the potential delisting of harken s common stock could adversely affect harken s ability to raise capital in the future by issuing common stock or securities convertible into common stock 
harken has a history of losses and may suffer losses in the future 
harken has reported losses in each of the last five fiscal years  including a net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  harken has reported cumulative net losses of approximately million over the last five fiscal years 
harken s ability to generate net income is strongly affected by  among other factors  harken s ability to successfully drill undeveloped reserves as well as the market price of crude oil and natural gas 
during the fourth quarter of  harken recorded a writedown of harken s oil and gas properties of approximately million primarily due to a significant reduction in harken s proved undeveloped reserves in colombia following the drilling of a non productive well 
if harken is unsuccessful in drilling productive wells or the market price of crude oil and natural gas declines  harken may report additional losses in the future 
consequently  future losses may adversely affect harken s business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents harken s financial condition may suffer if estimates of its oil and gas reserve information are adjusted  and fluctuations in oil and gas prices and other factors affect harken s oil and gas reserves 
harken s oil and gas reserve information is based upon criteria mandated by the sec  and reflects only estimates of the accumulation of oil and gas and the economic recoverability of those volumes 
harken s future production  revenues and expenditures with respect to such oil and gas reserves will likely be different from estimates  and any material differences may negatively affect harken s business  financial condition and results of operations 
petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may prove to differ materially from that assumed in estimating reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flow based on the same available data 
the estimated discounted future net cash flows described in this annual report for the year ended december   should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to harken s properties from proved reserves 
such estimates are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  in accordance with sec requirements  while future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
the sec requires that harken report its oil and natural gas reserves using the price as of the last day of the year 
using lower values in forecasting reserves will result in a shorter life being given to producing oil and natural gas properties because such properties  as their production levels are estimated to decline  will reach an uneconomic limit  with lower prices  at an earlier date 
there can be no assurance that a decrease in oil and gas prices or other differences in harken s estimates of its reserve will not adversely affect harken s financial condition and results of operations 
if estimated discounted future net cash flows decrease  harken may be required to take additional writedowns 
harken periodically reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties under applicable full cost accounting rules 
these rules require a writedown of the carrying value of oil and gas properties if the carrying value exceeds the applicable estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline in the future  even if only for a short period of 
table of contents time  it is possible that additional writedowns of oil and gas properties could occur 
whether harken will be required to take such a charge will depend on the prices for oil and gas at the end of any quarter and the effect of reserve additions or revisions  property sales and capital expenditures during such quarter 
lyford owns a significant amount of our common stock and exercises significant control over us 
as of march   lyford beneficially owned approximately of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock 
lyford is in a position to significantly influence decisions with respect to our direction and policies  including the election and removal of directors  mergers or other business combinations  the acquisition or disposition of our assets  future issuances of our common stock or other securities  our incurrence of debt  and the payment of dividends  if any  on our common stock  and amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
lyford s concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a future change of control 
risks associated with market conditions harken s stock price is volatile and the value of any investment in harken s common stock may fluctuate 
harken s stock price has been and is highly volatile  and harken believes this volatility is due to  among other things the results of harken s drilling  current expectations of harken s future financial performance  commodity prices of oil and natural gas  the volatility of the market in general 
for example  the common stock price has fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share over the last three years ending december  this volatility may affect the market value of harken s common stock in the future 
see part ii  item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 

table of contents future sales of harken s common stock pursuant to outstanding registration statements may affect the market price of harken s common stock 
there are currently several registration statements with respect to harken s common stock that are effective  pursuant to which certain of harken s stockholders may sell shares of common stock 
any such sale of stock may also decrease the market price of harken s common stock 
any conversions or redemptions of our european notes  or conversions of our series g  series g and series g preferred stock  involving a large issuance of shares could result in a dilution of stockholders ownership percentage of our common stock and may result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock 
in addition  we may elect to issue a significant number of additional shares of common stock for financing or other purposes  which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
we have issued shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock and may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future 
we are permitted under our charter to issue up to million shares of preferred stock 
we can issue shares of our preferred stock in one or more series and can set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our common stockholders 
any preferred stock that we issue may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividend priority or liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our common stock 
at december   we had outstanding  shares of series g preferred stock   shares of series g preferred stock and  shares of series g preferred stock 
these shares of preferred stock have rights senior to our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation 
in addition  such preferred stock may be converted into shares of common stock  which could dilute the value of common stock to current stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
each share of series g preferred stock  series g preferred stock and series g preferred stock  may be converted into shares of common stock at conversion prices of  and per share of common stock  respectively  for each liquidation value of a share of such preferred stock  plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends 
harken s domestic operating strategic plan includes the acquisition of additional reserves through business combinations 
harken s domestic operations have shifted from primarily an exploration and development focus to an acquisition and exploitation growth strategy  with a reduced emphasis on exploration 
harken is seeking additional acquisition opportunities to expand its domestic operations and increase its oil and gas reserves in north america 
harken may not be able to consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms 
additionally  any such future transactions may not achieve favorable financial results 
inherent in any future acquisitions are certain risks  such as the difficulty of assimilating operations and facilities of the acquired business  which could have a material adverse effect on harken s operating results  particularly during the period immediately following such acquisition 
future business combinations may also involve the issuance of shares of harken s common stock  which could have a dilutive effect on stockholders percentage ownership 
harken may not have a sufficient number of authorized shares to issue in any such business combinations and harken may need to obtain stockholder approval to authorize additional shares for issuance 
further  the use of shares in business combinations will reduce the number of shares available for the redemption of existing convertible notes and preferred stock 

table of contents in addition  acquisitions may require substantial financial expenditures that will need to be financed through cash flow from operations or future debt and equity offerings by harken  and harken may not be able to acquire companies or oil and gas properties using its equity as currency 
in the case of cash acquisitions  harken may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain debt or equity financing sufficient to fund future acquisitions of reserves 
risks associated with harken s operations oil and gas price fluctuations in the market may adversely affect the results of our operations 
the results of our operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for our oil and natural gas production 
substantially all of our sales of oil and natural gas are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received for our oil and natural gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  governmental regulations and taxes  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas and the overall economic environment 
significant declines in prices for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
any significant decline in prices of oil or gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
recently  the price of oil and natural gas has been volatile 
for example  during  the price for a bbl of oil ranged from a high of to a low of and the price for a mcf of gas ranged from a high of to a low of 
during  the price for a bbl of oil ranged from a high of to a low of and the price for a mcf of gas ranged from a high of to a low of 
our operations require significant expenditures of capital that may not be recovered 
we require significant expenditures of capital in order to locate and acquire producing properties and to drill exploratory and exploitation wells 
in conducting exploration  exploitation and development activities from a particular well  the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration  exploitation  development and production activities to be unsuccessful  potentially resulting in abandoning the well 
this could result in a total loss of our investment 
in addition  the cost and timing of drilling  completing and operating wells is difficult to predict 
the oil and gas we produce may not be readily marketable at the time of production 
crude oil  natural gas  condensate and other oil and gas products are generally sold to other oil and gas companies  government agencies and other industries 
the availability of ready markets for oil and gas that we might discover and the prices obtained for such oil and gas depend on many factors beyond our control  including the extent of local production and imports of oil and gas  the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities  fluctuating demand for oil and gas  
table of contents the marketing of competitive fuels  and the effects of governmental regulation of oil and gas production and sales 
natural gas associated with oil production is often not marketable due to demand or transportation limitations and is often flared at the producing well site 
pipeline facilities do not exist in certain areas of exploration and  therefore  any actual sales of discovered oil and gas might be delayed for extended periods until such facilities are constructed 
we may encounter operating hazards that may result in substantial losses 
we are subject to operating hazards normally associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  explosions  oil spills  cratering  pollution  earthquakes  labor disruptions and fires 
the occurrence of any such operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life and damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells  formations  production facilities or other properties 
we maintain insurance coverage limiting financial loss resulting from certain of these operating hazards 
we do not maintain full insurance coverage for all matters that may adversely affect our operations  including war  terrorism  nuclear reactions  government fines  treatment of waste  blowout expenses and business interruptions 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or underinsured events could reduce our revenues or increase our costs 
there can be no assurance that any insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities associated with operational hazards 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance  or its availability at premium levels that justify its purchase 
drilling oil and gas wells particularly in certain regions of the united states and foreign countries could be hindered by hurricanes  earthquakes and other weather related operating risks 
our operations in the texas and louisiana gulf coast area and in colombia  peru and panama are subject to risks from hurricanes and other natural disasters 
damage caused by hurricanes  earthquakes or other operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
we are not covered by insurance for any business interruption resulting from such events and  upon the occurrence of a natural disaster  this lack of coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we face strong competition from larger oil and gas companies  which could result in adverse effects on our business 
the exploration  exploitation and production business is highly competitive 
many of our competitors have substantially larger financial resources  staffs and facilities 
our competitors in the united states include numerous major oil and gas exploration and production companies and in colombia  peru and panama include such major oil and gas companies as bp amoco  exxon mobil  texaco shell and conoco phillips 
these major oil and gas companies are often better positioned to obtain the rights to exploratory acreage for which we compete 

table of contents our operations are subject to various litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business 
presently  certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in various litigation matters 
the nature of our and our subsidiaries operations also expose us to further possible litigation claims in the future 
for example  we are currently a party to the following pending proceedings in september  d 
e 
rice and karen rice  as trustees for the rice family living trust collectively referred to as the rice family filed a lawsuit against harken exploration company  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  in texas state court 
the rice family members claim damages in an amount of approximately million from harken exploration company s alleged spills on their property 
the parties have agreed to prepare and execute a final settlement agreement and joint dismissal of the litigation 
in december  energy investment  inc and eri investments  inc 
filed a lawsuit against xplor energy  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  in delaware state court 
energy investment and eri investment allege that they are entitled to appraisal and payment of the fair value of their common stock in xplor energy as of the date xplor energy merged with us 
in may  henry c 
magee iii magee filed a complaint against xplor energy spv i  inc and xplor energy operating company  as the successor in interest to araxas spv i  inc and araxas exploration  inc 
in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana 
in his complaint  magee alleges that xplor breached a contractual obligation relating to a royalty interest assignment from xplor s predecessor in interest  araxas exploration  inc there is risk that any matter in litigation could be adversely decided against us or our subsidiaries  regardless of our belief  opinion and position  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
litigation is highly costly and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
compliance with  or breach of  environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations 
our operations are subject to numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
we own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas and these properties and the wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the oil pollution act of  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously released wastes or property contamination 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and  may in some cases  impose strict liability for environmental damage 
strict liability means that we may be held liable for damage without regard to whether we were negligent or otherwise at fault 
environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with existing requirements of governmental bodies  our ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls 
our current permits and authorizations and ability to get future permits and 
table of contents authorizations  particularly in foreign countries  may be susceptible  on a going forward basis  to increased scrutiny  greater complexity resulting in increased costs  or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations 
in particular  we have experienced and may continue to experience delays in obtaining permits and authorization in colombia necessary for our operations 
we are required to obtain an environmental permit or approval from the governments in colombia  peru and panama prior to conducting seismic operations  drilling a well or constructing a pipeline in such foreign locations 
our operations in foreign countries have been delayed in the past and could be delayed in the future through the process of obtaining an environmental permit 
compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs of operations  as well as further restrict our foreign operations 
our foreign operations involve substantial costs and are subject to certain risks because the oil and gas industries in such countries are less developed 
the oil and gas industries in colombia  peru and panama are not as developed as the oil and gas industry in the united states 
as a result  our drilling and development operations in many instances take longer to complete and often cost more than similar operations in the united states 
the availability of technical expertise  specific equipment and supplies is more limited in colombia  peru and panama than in the united states 
we expect that such factors will continue to subject our international operations to economic and operating risks not experienced in our domestic operations 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development of oil and gas reserves in which all of our acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized 
costs related to the acquisition  holding and initial exploration of oil and gas associated with our contracts in countries with no proved reserves are initially capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
if we abandon all exploration efforts in a country where no proved reserves are assigned  all acquisition and exploration costs associated with the country are expensed 
from time to time  we make assessments as to whether our investment within a country is impaired and whether exploration activities within a country will be abandoned based on our analysis of drilling results  seismic data and other information we believe to be relevant 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict 
if we fail to comply with the terms of certain contracts related to our foreign operations  we could lose our rights under each of those contracts 
the terms of each of the colombian association contracts  the peruvian technical evaluation agreement and the panamanian technical evaluation agreement require that we perform certain activities  such as seismic interpretations and the drilling of required wells  in accordance with those contracts and agreements 
our failure to timely perform those activities as required could result in the loss of our rights under a particular contract  which would likely result in a significant loss to us 
as of december   we were in compliance with the requirements of each of the colombian association contracts 
we require significant additional financing for our foreign operations  which financing may not be available 
we anticipate that full development of our existing and future oil and gas discoveries and prospects in colombia  peru and panama may take several years and require significant additional capital expenditures 
if we are unable to timely obtain adequate funds to finance these investments  our ability to develop oil and gas 
table of contents reserves in these countries may be severely limited or substantially delayed 
such limitations or delay would likely result in substantial losses 
we anticipate that amounts required to fund our foreign activities  conducted primarily through our ownership of global  will be funded from existing cash balances  asset sales  operating cash flows  third party financing and from joint venture partners 
the exact usage of other future funding sources is unknown at this time  and there can be no assurance that we or global will have adequate funds available to finance our foreign operations 
our foreign operations are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties 
our subsidiary  global  currently conducts significant operations in colombia  peru and panama and may also conduct operations in other foreign countries in the future 
at december   approximately of our proved reserve volumes and of our consolidated revenues were related to global s colombian operations 
exploration and production operations in foreign countries are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties  including the risk of war  revolution  border disputes  expropriation  renegotiation or modification of existing contracts  import  export and transportation regulations and tariffs resulting in loss of revenue  property and equipment  taxation policies  including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims  exchange controls  currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over international operations  laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment  and the possibility of being subjected to the jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states 
central and south america have a history of political and economic instability 
this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies  laws or regulations that might assume a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investment 
in an extreme case  such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of foreign owned assets 
any such activity could result in a significant loss to us and global 
guerrilla activity in colombia could disrupt or delay global s operations  and we are concerned about safeguarding global s operations and personnel in colombia 
colombia s year armed conflict between the government and leftist guerrilla groups has escalated in recent years 
the current government s quest for peace was unsuccessful 
the breakdown of peace negotiations has resulted in increased military action by the colombian government directed against the rebel groups operating in colombia 
unless the parties determine to return to peace negotiations  the military confrontation with the rebel groups is expected to continue 
also  the increased activity of right wing 
table of contents paramilitary groups  formed in opposition to the left wing guerilla groups  has contributed to the escalation in violence 
the increase in violence has affected business interests in colombia 
targeting such enterprises as symbols of foreign exploitation  particularly in the north of the country  the rebel groups have attempted to hamper production of hydrocarbons 
the cumulative effect of escalation in the armed conflict and the resulting unstable political and security situation has led to increased risks and costs and the downgrading of colombia s country risk rating 
global s oil and gas operations are in areas outside guerrilla control and with the exception of its increased security requirements  our operations continue mostly unaffected  although from time to time  guerilla activity in colombia has delayed our projects there 
this guerilla activity has increased over the last few years  causing delays in the development of our fields in colombia 
guerilla activity  such as road blockades  has also from time to time slowed our deployment of workers in the field and affected our operations 
in addition  guerillas could attempt to disrupt the flow of our production through pipelines 
in addition to these security issues  we have also become the subject of media focus in colombia that may further compromise our security position in the country 
there can be no assurance that attempts to reduce or prevent guerilla activity will be successful or that guerilla activity will not disrupt global s operations in the future 
there can also be no assurance that global can maintain the safety of its operations and personnel in colombia or that this violence will not affect its operations in the future 
continued or heightened security concerns in colombia could also result in a significant loss to us 
the united states government may impose economic or trade sanctions on colombia that could result in a significant loss to us 
colombia is among several nations whose progress in stemming the production and transit of illegal drugs is subject to annual certification by the president of the united states 
although colombia was so certified in  there can be no assurance that  in the future  colombia will receive certification or a national interest waiver 
the failure to receive certification or a national interest waiver may result in any of the following all bilateral aid  except anti narcotics and humanitarian aid  would be suspended  the export import bank of the united states and the overseas private investment corporation would not approve financing for new projects in colombia  united states representatives at multilateral lending institutions would be required to vote against all loan requests from colombia  although such votes would not constitute vetoes  and the president of the united states and congress would retain the right to apply future trade sanctions 
each of these consequences could result in adverse economic consequences in colombia and could further heighten the political and economic risks associated with our operations there 
any changes in the holders of significant government offices could have adverse consequences on our relationship with the colombian national oil company and the colombian government s ability to control guerrilla activities and could exacerbate the factors relating to our foreign operations discussed above 
any sanctions imposed on colombia by the united states government could threaten our ability to obtain necessary financing to develop 
table of contents the colombian properties or cause colombia to retaliate against us  including by nationalizing our colombian assets 
accordingly  the imposition of the foregoing economic and trade sanctions on colombia would likely result in a substantial loss and a decrease in the price of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that the united states will not impose sanctions on colombia in the future or predict the effect in colombia that these sanctions might cause 
harken may suffer losses from exchange rate fluctuations 
harken accounts for its colombian  costa rican  peruvian and panamanian operations using the us dollar as the functional currency 
the costs associated with harken s exploration efforts in colombia  costa rica  peru and panama have typically been denominated in us dollars 
a portion of colombian revenues are denominated in colombian pesos 
to the extent that the amount of harken s revenues denominated in colombian pesos is greater than the amount of costs denominated in colombian pesos  harken could suffer a loss if the value of the colombian peso were to drop relative to the value of the us dollar 
any substantial currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on harken s results of operations 
in recent years the value of the colombian peso relative to the us dollar has declined 
for example  the average exchange rate for the colombian peso into us dollars for december was  as compared to an average of for december and for december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk harken is exposed to market risk from movements in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
as part of an overall risk management strategy  harken uses derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce risks associated with these factors 
commodity price risk harken is a producer of hydrocarbon commodities  including crude oil  condensate and natural gas 
harken uses oil and gas derivative financial instruments  limited to swaps  collars and floors with maturities of months or less  to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas commodity prices on future crude oil and natural gas production 
harken has evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in commodity prices would have had on the fair value of its commodity price risk sensitive financial instruments at year end as of december   the fair value of harken s natural gas collar contract was an approximate liability of  assuming a increase in natural gas prices from actual prices at december   the potential increase in the liability of harken s natural gas collar contract at december  would have been approximately  the average percentage of harken s natural gas production hedged during was approximately 
in december  harken purchased a crude oil floor contract with a strike price of per barrel for a notional amount of  barrels per month over a contract period from january  through december  harken designated the above derivative as a hedge of the exposure to variability of cash flows related to forecasted sales of specified production from certain of harken s domestic property operations 
such crude oil floor contract is reflected in other assets on harken s consolidated balance sheet at december  with a fair value of approximately interest rate risk consistent with the prior year  harken invests cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general 
table of contents liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a significant interest rate risk to harken 
consistent with the prior year  harken considers its interest rate risk exposure related to long term debt obligations to not be material 
as at december  all of harken s financing obligations carry a fixed interest rate per annum 
harken has no open interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk consistent with the prior year  global conducts international business in colombia and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses and capital expenditures that are denominated in colombian pesos 
however  because predominately all material transactions in global s existing foreign operations are denominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for all operations 
consistent with the prior year  exposure from transactions in currencies other than us dollars is not considered material
