significant accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  contingencies  such as litigation  and contract terms that have multiple elements and other complexities typical in the telecommunications equipment industry 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into agreements to sell products and services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
we recognize product revenue generally upon shipment  when all four of the following criteria are met we have a contract with our customer  when delivery has occurred and risk of loss passes to the customer  when our price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
for transactions where we have not yet obtained customer acceptance  revenue is generally deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
revenue for installation or other services such as training is recognized upon completion of the service 
maintenance contract revenue is typically recognized ratably over the period of the contracts 
for arrangements that involve multiple elements  such as sales of products that include maintenance or installation services  revenue is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all the undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
allowance for sales returns a reserve for sales returns is established based on actual product returns 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and our operating expenses could be adversely affected 
credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable that were established 
inventory provisions inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to make adjustments to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or market  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals we generally provide a warranty for hardware product sales for twelve months and a warranty for software sales for three months 
the software warranty entitles the customer to bug fixes but not software upgrades during the warranty period 
we accrue warranty expense based on historical expense trends calculated as a percentage of new product sales 
actual expenses are charged against the accrual in the period they are incurred 
on a quarterly basis  the warranty accrual is analyzed for adequacy based on actual trends and subsequent adjustments are made to the liability balance 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
historically  all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates 
stock based compensation we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
accordingly  no charges were taken during fiscal and as all stock options were granted at market price 
deferred taxes we have incurred tax losses in the last five fiscal years and  at march   we have an estimated million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state operating loss carryforwards available expiring in the years through we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  given the uncertainty as to their realization 
in future years  these benefits are available to reduce or eliminate taxes on future taxable income 
current federal and state tax laws include provisions that could limit the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards in the event of certain defined changes in stock ownership 
our issuances of common and preferred stock could result in such a change 
accordingly  the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited by these provisions  and this limitation may result i n the loss of carryforward benefits to the extent the above limit portion expires before it can be used 
management has not yet determined the extent of the limitation  if any 
results of operations the following table depicts selected data derived from our consolidated condensed statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented fiscal year ended percent of revenue march march march product revenue service and other revenue total revenue product revenue gross margin service and other revenue gross margin total gross margin sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructure costs amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net interest income expense  net loss before taxes income tax benefit loss before accounting change cumulative effect of change in accounting principle relating to goodwill net loss overview and highlights we are focused on achieving profitability 
in the year ended march   we were nearly breakeven with a net loss of  this loss compares to an million loss in fiscal and a million loss in fiscal the primary driver for profitability is growing our revenue base 
total revenue for the year ended march  increased million or from the year ended march   which increased million or from the year ended march  the increases in total revenue were due to increases in product revenue partially offset by decreases in service and other revenue 
in order to grow revenue  we must develop and successfully introduce new products 
during the year ended march   we announced a number of new product releases incorporating significant product developments  including the addition of cisco s ios software to our scream platform  enhancements for secure voice on our shoutip platform  new versions of a number of cards for our promina platform with enhanced functionality as well as production cost savings  and our new network management system  netms 
revenue from our new products  scream  shoutip and netms  was million for the year ended march  new product revenue for fiscal years ended march  and march  was less than of total product revenue 
until our new products achieve broad market acceptance  we are dependent on revenue from existing products 
to date  we have been successful in extending the lifecycle of our circuit switched products by continually expanding their functionality  and we have developed a migration path to broadband technology through the screamlink program 
the screamlink program  which facilitates the connection of our circuit switched promina products to our broadband scream products  has helped stimulate demand for both product lines 
the promina product line continues to provide the substantial majority of our revenue  and in the year ended march   we received substantial new orders for promina products  particularly from defense agencies  including a large order comprised of promina  screamlink and scream gear for integrated voice  routin g  and data transport capabilities over a variety of transport protocols 
our new products are targeted primarily at telecommunications carriers  and also at new applications within our existing customer base 
the environment for sales of new equipment to telecommunications carriers remains challenging  but we believe that some carriers are beginning to resume investment in new equipment  which may result in increased sales opportunities for our new products 
in the year ended march   the scream platform was tested in a number of carriers testing labs 
we also installed a new shoutip network for an existing customer to deliver voip 
we tested shoutip for defense customers  and sold shoutip to the united states central command centcom  for a secure voip application 
we strive to maintain a strong cash position for stability and flexibility in managing our business 
total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments at march  rose to million  including million in long term restricted cash related to performance guarantees on customer contracts and our facilities leases in fremont  california 
this compares to million at march  and million at march  the increase in cash resulted from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
revenue year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy product revenue service and other revenue total revenue the increases in total revenue in fiscal and fiscal from the prior years are due primarily to increases in product revenue  partially offset by decreases in service revenue 
the increase in product revenue in the year ended march  compared to the prior year is due to strong sales in the federal government sales channel 
federal government sales in fiscal increased million from fiscal and increased million in fiscal from fiscal  due largely to government defense initiatives and purchases of our new products by the federal government 
these increases were offset by decreases in international commercial sales of million in fiscal compared to fiscal and  in fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases reflect a general decline in the commercial market for circuit switched products 
product revenue is generated primarily from our circuit switched product line  promina  which accounts for the majority of our product sales worldwide 
additionally  the recognition of revenue from some recent large deals will depend on cu stomer deployment schedules and the timing of contractual acceptance provisions being met  which could cause significant fluctuations in our revenue in the near term 
we have developed new service creation products  scream and shoutip  for the broadband equipment and ip telephony markets 
the product revenue from these products in fiscal was million  and product revenue from these products in fiscal and was less than of total product revenue in fiscal and we expect the level of revenue from these new products  which are in the early stage of customer adoption with prolonged sales cycles  to fluctuate in the near term until we establish a broad customer base 
the decreases in service and other revenue in fiscal and fiscal from the prior years are primarily the result of a general decline in the installed base of equipment held by non federal customers requiring ongoing service support 
in addition  a number of customers have been lowering their levels of service support in efforts to reduce their operating costs  which is enabled in part by the reliability of our promina products 
we expect that service revenue will remain relatively flat in the near term 
gross margin year ended march march march product revenue gross margin service and other revenue gross margin total gross margin total gross margin improved in both fiscal and fiscal from the prior years  primarily due to higher product revenue and our ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
the increase in product revenue gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to supply chain initiatives begun in the quarter ended june   which have yielded reductions in materials cost  increases in product revenue  allowing fixed costs to be spread over a greater revenue base  a change in the mix of products  including a million decrease in third party product sales  which have lower gross margins  a one time refund in the amount of  for royalty fees paid in prior years that was received in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in product revenue gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  increases in product revenue  allowing fixed costs to be spread over a greater revenue base  and a change in the mix of products  to a larger percentage of higher margin products  and an increase in product revenue as a percentage of total revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in service and other revenue gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to reductions in compensation and related costs of million  decreases in third party service costs of  and decreases in facilities and rental costs of  the decrease in service and other revenue gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to a decrease in service and other revenue  requiring fixed costs to be spread over a lower revenue base 
gross margins may be adversely affected in the future by increases in material and labor costs  increases in subcontractor charges  changes in the mix of products and services we sell  increased sales through resellers  increased warranty costs  or pressure on pricing and margins due to competition 
our newer product lines  scream and shoutip  currently have lower gross margins than our promina product line  as a result of customary discounting for early customers and higher per unit costs associated with low purchase volumes of components 
we expect gross margins to be relatively flat in the near term  provided the mix of products and services is consistent with those seen in fiscal operating expenses year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructure costs amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets total operating expenses operating expenses were million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal and million  or of total revenue  in fiscal we expect total operating expenses to remain relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal decreased or million compared to operating expenses in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to restructure costs of million in fiscal for employee separation costs 
there was also an increase in research and development spending  mostly due to increased headcount  offset by reductions in sales and marketing and general and administrative spending  due largely to savings attributable to downsizing or closures of some field offices  the lower costs of our new headquarters facility  and lower legal fees from fewer legal matters and a shift from the use of outside counsel to in house resources 
operating expenses in fiscal decreased or million compared to operating expenses in fiscal the most significant components of the decrease were reductions of million of direct and temporary employee workforce expenses   of recruiting and relocation expenses and million of information technology related expenses 
these decreases were primarily related to restructuring initiatives that occurred in fiscal and which included headcount reductions 
a reduction of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of million resulted from adopting statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  prototype costs incurred in fiscal during the early stages of our scream and shoutip product life cycle  caused engineering related expensed materials to be million highe r in fiscal than in also  there was a reduction of million of depreciation and amortization expenses that resulted from a tightly managed capital budget and prior year s capital purchases becoming fully depreciated  partially offset by an increase in restructure costs of  from employee separation costs 
sales and marketing 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal compared to is primarily the result of a  decrease in facility  information technology and corporate services related costs  due to the downsizing and closure of some field offices as well as lower costs for our new headquarters facility  a  decrease in outside services  and a  decrease in depreciation and amortization  as assets becoming fully depreciated outpaced recent capital spending 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in travel and entertainment 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to is primarily from a  decrease in depreciation and amortization  again due to a tightly managed capital budget  a  reduction in advertising expense  a  decrease in facility and information technology costs  and a  decrease in recruiting expense 
research and development 
the increase in research and development spending in fiscal compared to is primarily the result of a million increase in compensation and benefits  due to increased headcount  a  increase in facilities  information technology and corporate services related costs  and a  increase in depreciation and amortization  due largely to the acquisition of test equipment for new products  these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in engineering related expensed materials  due to higher expense in the prior year for prototypes of new products  a  decrease in recruiting and relocation costs  and a  decrease in software and supplies 
the decrease in research and development costs in fiscal compared to was due to a million decrease in salary related expenses  due to a reduction in headcount  a million decrease in depreciation and amortization  and a million decrease in engineering related expensed materials  again due to higher expense in the prior year for prototypes of new products 
general and administrative 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to is due primarily to a  decrease in outside legal fees from fewer legal matters and a shift from the use of outside counsel to in house resources  and a  decrease in facility and information technology related costs  these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in outside services  consisting of audit fees and third party service costs 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to was due primarily to a  decrease in salary related expenses  a  decrease in recruiting and relocation expenses  and a  decrease in facility and information technology related costs 
restructure costs 
restructure costs in fiscal were  the charge consisted of  for a lease write off and  for fixed assets write offs due to the office closure costs of a sales office in dallas  offset by  in adjustments to our previous lease restructuring estimates 
the closure of a sales office in dallas was in conjunction with a company wide initiative to reduce expenses across all functions 
restructure costs in fiscal were million and related to employee separation costs 
the reduction in the number of employees was primarily a result of management s intent to realign the business to support the current revenue levels 
the remaining liability for restructuring charges is  at march   as shown in the table below 
components of accrued restructure costs  which are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets  a nd changes in accrued amounts related to this restructuring program during fiscal and as of march  were as follows in thousands employee separation costs lease write off office closure costs other restructure costs total balance at march  provision payments balance at march  provision payments balance at march  accrued liabilities associated with restructuring charges are classified as current  as the company intends to satisfy such liabilities within the next fiscal year 
we completed a restructuring in april that included a reorganization of our international sales channel resulting in employee separation costs of approximately  and a charge for the consolidation of our sales and service offices in vienna and ashburn  virginia to one facility in sterling  virginia of approximately  we expect this plan to result in total pre tax charges of approximately million  and we intend to satisfy this liability within fiscal non operating items year ended year ended march march fy vs fy march fy vs fy interest income interest expense gain on sale of federal services business gain on insurance settlement other income expense the decrease in interest income in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal  primarily relating to short term investments  is the result of a declining yield from our investment portfolio 
interest expense in fiscal  and was due primarily to the interest on our convertible subordinated debentures 
also included in interest expense in fiscal and and to a lesser extent in fiscal is interest related to our million note payable to our landlord for building repairs related to our former headquarters 
the note was entered into in january and bears interest at  payable in monthly installments over years 
in fiscal  and  we recorded gains on the sale of our federal services business of million  million and million  respectively 
these gains resulted from certain milestones being met as part of the sale of the federal services business to caci 
in fiscal and  we recorded gains of million and million  respectively  primarily from non recurring proceeds from an insurance settlement related to our former headquarters campus 
income tax provision benefit income tax provision was  in fiscal  due to taxes on our international business 
income tax benefit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
each year  we evaluate the adequacy of our tax liability reserves taking into account the statute of limitations on previously filed tax returns as well as our expected net income losses 
the result of this reevaluation was to reduce the amount of reserves and record an income tax benefit in fiscal and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle relating to goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill as a result of the implementation of sfas this charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our condensed consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash balances of million  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the balance includes cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of  short term investments of million  and long term restricted cash included in other assets on our balance sheet of million related to performance guarantees on customer contracts and our facilities leases in fremont  california 
the company benefited in fiscal from a  refund of county property taxes  a million payment from caci as part of the sale of our federal services business  a  refund from royalties previously paid  and million in proceeds from issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million 
this compares to net cash used in operating activities of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
non cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal were due primarily to depreciation and amortization of million offset by a million gain on the sale of our federal services business 
non cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for fiscal were due primarily to depreciation and amortization of million  million of insurance settlement proceeds related to our former headquarters campus  and million from the cumulative effect of an accounting change relating to goodwill from the implementation of sfas  offset by a million gain on the sale of our federal services business and a million gain r elated to the insurance settlement 
non cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for fiscal were due primarily to depreciation and amortization of million and million of insurance settlement proceeds related to our former headquarters campus  offset by a million gain on the sale of our federal services business and a million gain related to the insurance settlement 
we expect to continue to incur charges for depreciation and amortization and are expecting to record gains from the sale of our federal services business in the first quarter of fiscal  when the last payment is due  but are not expecting the other items to affect our cash flows going forward as they are non recurring in nature 
the other items that affect our cash flow from operations are changes in our assets and liabilities accounts  including accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
days sales outstanding dso for the quarter ended march  was days as compared to days for the quarter ended march  due to the timing of orders shipped in the quarter 
net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million 
this compares to net cash provided by investing activities of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
purchases of short term investments exceeded proceeds from maturities of short term investments by million in fiscal as compared to proceeds from maturities of short term investments exceeding purchases of short term investments by million in fiscal this change resulted from turning short term investments more quickly in an effort to maximize returns and offset the declines in the yields we have experienced over the past year 
purchases of short term investments exceeded proceeds from maturities of short term investments by million in fiscal investments in property  plant and equipment remained fairly consistent at approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
investments in property  plant and equipment in fiscal were million 
in fiscal  and  net cash provided by used in investing activities included million  million and million  respectively  in proceeds from the sale of our federal services business 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal   and was million  million and million  respectively  due to the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
our stock price has increased from at march  to at march  if our stock price continues to rise  we would expect more employees to exercise their stock options resulting in increased proceeds to us from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of the options 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of march  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt note payable interest on long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments to purchase materials and components from suppliers in exchange for favorable pricing or more beneficial terms 
as of march   there were no such outstanding commitments 
we believe that our existing current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations  purchases of capital equipment  and research and development programs currently planned  at least through the next months

business environment and risk factors our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described below 
although we have tried to identify the material risks to our business  this is not an all inclusive list 
there may be additional risks that have not yet been identified and risks that are not material now but could become material 
any one of these risks could hurt our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have incurred net losses in the past and may continue to incur losses in the future 
for each of the past six fiscal years  we have incurred net losses 
although the company has reduced operating expenses over the past few years  we will need revenue to continue to grow in order to achieve profitability 
our circuit switched product line  promina  currently provides the bulk of our revenue  but revenue from that product line may decline within the next few years 
our newer broadband and ip telephony product lines  scream and shoutip  have not yet achieved market acceptance or broad commercial sales  and we are incurring substantial product development and marketing expenses for those product lines 
accordingly  we will not likely be profitable on an ongoing basis unless our newer product lines achieve commercial success that outpaces the anticipated decline of our promina product line 
in addition  we must contain our operating expenses  many of which are fixed in the short term making it difficult to reduce expenses rapidly in response to shortfalls in revenue 
our operating results may continue to fluctuate 
our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations may result from a number of factors  including the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to our customers  the timing of the introduction of  and market acceptance for  new products and services  variations in the mix of products and services we sell  the timing and level of certain expenses  such as marketing activities  prototype costs  or write offs of obsolete inventory  the timing of revenue recognition  which depends on numerous factors  such as contractual acceptance provisions and separability of arrangements involving multiple elements  including some factors that are out of our control  such as assurance as to collectibility  the adoption of new accounting standards  such as changes to revenue recognition principles or the potential requirement to record expenses for employee stock option grants  the timing and size of federal government budget approvals  and economic conditions in the telecommunications industry  including the overall capital expenditures of our customers 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
any shortfall in revenue may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
investors should not rely on our results or growth for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
our stock price is volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
fluctuations or a decline in our stock price may occur regardless of our performance 
among the factors that could affect our stock price  in addition to our performance  are variations between our operating results and either the guidance we have furnished to the public or the published expectations of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new products or services  acquisitions  or other significant transactions  sale of our common stock or other securities in the future  the inclusion or exclusion of our stock in various indices or investment categories  especially as compared to the investment profiles of our stockholders at a given time  changes in the stock prices of other telecommunications equipment companies  to the extent that some investors tend to buy or sell our stock based on segment trends  and the trading volume of our common stock 
we are dependent on revenue from the promina product line 
currently  we derive the majority of our product revenue from our promina product line  a circuit based narrowband technology 
the market for our promina product is expected to decline as networks are expected to increasingly employ packet based broadband technology 
this technology migration resulted in a significant drop in sales of our promina products in the commercial markets over the last several years 
if this decline extends into our government markets in a similar fashion before we gain traction on our newer packet based broadband product lines  our revenue will decrease  and our business and results of operations will suffer 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from sales to governmental agencies 
a significant portion of our total revenue from product sales comes from contracts with governmental agencies  most of which do not include long term purchase commitments 
historically  the government has been slower to adopt new technology  such as packet based technology  which has had the effect of extending the product life of our promina product 
while the government has purchased and is evaluating some of our new products for broader deployment  this new business may not be sufficient to offset expected declines in sales of our promina product 
furthermore  if the government accelerated adoption of new technology  and replaced the promina product line in their networks with products other than ours  our product revenue would decline sharply 
we anticipate that our past experience will result in future contracts with the federal government  however  we face significant competition in this endeavor 
if we fa il in renewing a significant number of federal government contracts or if sales to the federal government decline sharply  our revenue may not increase to profitable levels 
continued declines in purchases by our commercial customers and the overall decline of product sales in the service provider market could negatively affect our operations and financial results 
over the last several years  the financial health of many of our commercial customers  particularly telecommunications service providers  has deteriorated  resulting in a decreased demand for telecommunications products 
in addition  the timing and volume of purchases by service providers can be unpredictable due to their need to generate new revenue with sharply reduced capital budgets while reducing operating expenses 
further  our ability to recognize revenue on sales to these customers will depend on our meeting various acceptance criteria imposed on us in connection with these products by our early adopter customers  and on the relative financial condition of these customers and whether receivables balances from them are deemed to be collectible 
also  the selling cycle of our scream and shoutip product lines could be extended if our service provider customers continue to reduce their capital budgets 
declines in revenue as a result of any of these factors could cause a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that will achieve market acceptance 
our operating results will depend on the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing  and broad commercial distribution of our newer packet based products  the scream and shoutip product lines 
the success of these and other new products is dependent on several factors  including proper product definition  competitive pricing  timely completion and introduction to the market  differentiation from competitors products  and broad market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks 
our scream product line is targeted at long established incumbent carriers  such as bellsouth  sbc communications  sprint  verizon  british telecom and france telecom  who typically have stringent product requirements and who are reluctant to purchase p roducts from vendors lacking substantial revenue and assets 
we may not successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our products 
products and technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive  which in turn could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability 
the success of our scream product line depends largely on it being chosen by service providers as a platform for the delivery of new services 
since the second quarter of our fiscal year  we have spent the majority of our research and development and marketing resources to position ourselves  and our scream family of products  as the next generation of telecommunications equipment that will enable carriers to optimize the delivery of differentiated services 
the future success of the scream product line will depend in large measure on service providers choosing to invest in products  such as scream  that can be used to deliver new services such as quality of service guarantees  class of service subscriptions  or bandwidth on demand  to increase their revenue and lower their operating expenses 
if service providers do not meaningfully invest in such new technologies  or do not choose the scream product line for such investment  our revenues from scream will be negatively affected  which will in turn have a negative effect on our business and operating results 
we need partnerships to accelerate the acceptance of our new products by service providers 
building relationships with partners  such as software application partners  system integrators  oems or resellers can accelerate the sales of new products 
the importance of the software application partners is that they provide functions  such as billing  mediation  provisioning and configuration that are needed to create a total solution for our customers 
we need product oem or resale partners to supplement and enhance our sales force both in the united states and overseas 
service providers rely on systems integrators to incorporate new equipment or services into their network 
these integrators are important in the large incumbent carrier networks and could facilitate our entry into those networks 
while we have begun the process of identifying and signing software application  system integrator and oem or resale partners  more partners may be necessary in all these areas for us to be successful 
nb sp  we may need to pursue strategic partnerships with vendors who have broader technology or product offerings in order to compete with the end to end solution providers  as well as to bolster our co marketing efforts 
failure to sign up these new strategic partners could affect our ability to grow overall revenue 
gross margins could decline over future periods 
gross margins may be adversely affected in the future due to increases in material and labor costs  increases in subcontractor charges  changes in the mix of products and services we sell  increased sales through resellers  increased warranty costs  or pressure on pricing and margins due to competition 
our newer product lines  scream and shoutip  currently have lower gross margins than our promina product line  as a result of customary discounting for early customers and higher per unit costs associated with low purchase volumes of components 
a decline in our gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
factors beyond our control could affect our ability to sell into international markets 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and depend on non us operations of our subsidiaries and distribution partners 
in addition  we also maintain a satellite research and development facility in ottawa  province of ontario  canada and  on a case by case basis  we outsource research and development activities to third parties here in the us and abroad 
as a general rule  international sales tend to have risks that are difficult to foresee and plan for  including political and economic stability  regulatory changes  currency exchange rates  changes in tax rates and structures  and collection of accounts receivable 
further  our international markets are served primarily by non exclusive resellers who themselves may be severely affected by economic or market changes within a particular country or region 
our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors that could affect these activities 
unforeseen or unpredictable changes in international markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the divestiture of our federal services business has reduced our ability to control the quality of service provided to our federal government customers 
on december   we closed the sale of our federal service business to caci  which subsequently provides maintenance and other services to our federal government customers 
we continue to sell net 
com products directly to the federal government and we rely on caci to perform various services for them 
additionally  we have a strategic alliance with caci to jointly market each other s products and services 
as a result of these arrangements  we are dependent on caci to provide the level of service to which our customers have become accustomed 
if caci experiences difficulties in providing those services  or for any other reason leaves our mutual customers unsatisfied  it could adversely affect purchasing decisions for our products and cause our federal government customers to seek products from other vendors 
the market for our products is highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than us 
the market for telecommunication equipment is highly competitive and dynamic  has been characterized by rapid changes to and the convergence of technologies  and has seen a worldwide migration from existing circuit technology to the new packet based technologies 
we compete directly  both internationally and domestically  with many different companies  some of which are large  established suppliers of end to end solutions  such as alcatel  cisco  juniper  lucent  nortel and siemens 
in addition  there are a number of other smaller companies that are targeting the same market as us 
scream competitors include juniper  cisco  copper mountain  nortel  and redback 
for our shoutip product line  competition includes the established market leader  cisco  and smaller companies such as nuera and vocality 
some of our larger competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have and offer a wider range of networking products than we offer 
they are often able to devote greater resources to the development  marketing and sale of their products and to use their equity or significant cash reserves to acquire other companies with technology and or products that compete directly with ours 
they often can compete favorably on price because their large product selection allows them to bundle multiple solutions together without significantly affecting their overall product margins 
the smaller companies have more ability than net 
com to focus their resources on a particular product development unencumbered by the requirements to support an existing product line 
as a result of the flexibility of their market strategies  our competitors may be able to obtain strategic advantages th at may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the networking equipment market has seen the constant introduction of new technologies that has reduced the value of older technology solutions 
this has created pricing pressure on older products while increasing the performance expectations of newer networking equipment 
moreover  broadband technology standards are constantly evolving and alternative technologies or technologies with greater capability are constantly introduced and sought by our customers 
it is possible that the introduction of other technologies will either supplant our current technologies and technologies we have in development or will require us to significantly lower our prices in order to remain competitive 
to remain competitive  we must continue to evolve our scream and shoutip product lines to meet the ever changing technology needs of the networking market while ensuring that they can be sold at a competitive price 
nb sp  we also must enhance our promina product line to provide needed features that increase their overall value for the customer while keeping the price competitive 
due to the competitive nature of the market and the relative age of our promina product offerings as well as the competitive pressure being exerted on our scream and shoutip technologies  we may not be able to maintain prices for them at levels that will sustain profitability 
if we are unable to sign competitive resale partners  our future product and service revenue will be adversely affected 
our international sales are made almost entirely through indirect channels that include distributors and resellers worldwide  and our business strategy includes leveraging resale partners in the united states as well 
our reseller agreements do not have minimum purchase requirements that they must meet 
our distributors and resellers often also resell product lines from other companies  including our competitors  some of whom have strong market position relative to net 
com 
because of existing relationships that many of our competitors have with distributors and resellers  it is often difficult for us to find a distributor or reseller who is willing and contractually able to resell our products 
if we cannot develop relationships with distributors and resellers that can effectively market and sell our products and services  we may not be able to meet our forecasted revenue in future quarters 
our products have long sales cycles  making it difficult to predict when a customer will place an order and when to forecast revenue from the related sale 
our products are very complex and represent a significant capital expenditure to our customers 
the purchase of our products can have a significant impact on how a customer designs its network and provides services either within its own organization or to an external customer 
consequently  our customers often engage in extensive testing and evaluation of products before purchase 
there are also numerous financial and budget considerations and approvals that the customer often must obtain before it will issue a purchase order 
as a result  the length of our sales cycle can be quite long  extending beyond twelve months in some cases 
in addition  our customers  including resellers  often have the contractual right to delay scheduled order delivery dates with minimal penalties and to cancel orders within specified time frames without penalty  which makes it difficult to predict whether or not an order may ac tually ship 
we often must incur substantial sales and marketing expense to ensure a purchase order is placed 
if the order is not placed in the quarter forecasted  our sales may not meet forecast and revenue may be insufficient to meet expenses 
because it is difficult for us to accurately forecast sales  particularly within a given time frame  we face a risk of carrying too much or too little inventory 
typically  the majority of our revenue in each quarter has resulted from orders received and shipped in that quarter 
while we do not believe that backlog is necessarily indicative of future revenue levels  our customers ordering patterns and the possible absence of backlogged orders create a significant risk that we could carry too much or too little inventory if orders do not match forecasts 
rather than base forecasts on orders received  we have been forced to schedule production and commit to certain expenses based more upon forecasts of future sales  which are difficult to predict in the telecommunications industry 
furthermore  if large orders do not close when forecasted or if near term demand weakens for the products we have available to ship  our operating results for that quarter or subsequent quarters would be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to retain existing employees and attract  recruit and retain key personnel  then we may not be able to successfully manage our business 
our success continues to be dependent on our being able to attract and retain highly skilled engineers  managers and other key employees 
despite the economic slowdown  we must continue to compete for the most qualified personnel for new positions and to replace departing employees 
any restrictions on our ability to use stock options as a key component of employee compensation  such as changes in accounting treatment  stockholder actions  or changes in corporate regulations  could severely impair our ability to recruit and retain personnel 
if we are not able to continue to attract  recruit and retain key personnel  particularly in engineering  sales and marketing positions  we may be unable to meet important company objectives such as product delivery deadlines and sales targets 
our ability to ship our products in a timely manner is dependent on the availability of component parts and other factors 
several key components of our products are available only from a single source  including certain integrated circuits  and power supplies 
depending upon the component  there may or may not be alternative sources or substitutes 
some components are purchased through purchase orders without an underlying long term supply contract  and some components are in short supply generally throughout the industry 
if a required component were no longer available  we might have to significantly reengineer the affected product 
further  variability in demand and cyclical shortages of capacity in the semiconductor industry have caused lead times for ordering parts to increase from time to time 
if we encounter shortages or delays in receiving ordered components or if we are not able to accurately forecast our ordering requirements  we may be unable to ship ordered products in a timely manner  resulting in decreased revenue 
generally  our customer contracts allow the customers to reschedule delivery dates or cancel orders within certain time frames before shipment without penalty and outside those time frames with a penalty 
because of these and other factors  there are risks of excess or inadequate inventory that could negatively affect our expenses  revenue and earnings 
additionally  dx rated orders from the federal government can interrupt scheduled shipments to our other customers 
we single source our manufacturing processes  a failure or delay by a contract manufacturing vendor could affect our ability to ship our products timely 
we currently subcontract some product testing and all product manufacturing to third parties  with generally only a single source for manufacturing of each product line 
final test and assembly is generally performed at our fremont  california facility  although we intend to have third parties also perform more of those functions 
while subcontracting creates substantial cost efficiencies in the manufacturing process  it also exposes us to delays in product shipments should the contract manufacturer be unable to perform 
we have agreed to compensate our contract manufacturers in the event of termination or cancellation of orders  discontinuance of product  or excess material created by an engineering change 
also  should a contract manufacturer in some future period decide not to renew our contract with them  it would be difficult for us to quickly transfer our manufacturing requirements to another vendor  likely causing substantial de lays in customer product shipments and affecting our revenue and results of operations 
we have recently transitioned some of our product manufacturing to a new vendor  but the transition is limited to specific products and has not materially diversified the outsourcing risk 
also  the transition itself and the lack of experience with the new vendor could cause delays in customer product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 
our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business 
our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology 
although we attempt to establish and maintain rights in proprietary technology and products through patents  copyrights  and trade secrets laws  we cannot predict whether such protection will be adequate  or whether our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights 
as competition in the communications equipment industry increases and the functionality of the products in this industry further overlap  we believe that companies in the communications equipment industry may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
we have received and may continue to receive notice from third parties  including some of our competitors  claiming that we are infringing their patents or their other proprietary rights 
we cannot predict whether we will prevail in any litigation over third party claims  or t hat we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents on commercially reasonable terms 
any of these claims  whether with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  divert our management s time  attention and resources  delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  a third party may not be willing to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a claim of product infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non infringing technology  we may be unable to market the affected product 
although we have a number of patent applications pending  we cannot guarantee that any will result in the issuance of a patent 
even if issued  the patent may later be found to be invalid or may be infringed without our knowledge 
our issued patents might not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction and it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of our proprietary technology by others 
regardless of our efforts to protect our intellectual property  the rapidly changing technologies in the networking industry make our future success primarily a function of the skill  expertise and management abilities of our employees 
nonetheless  others may assert property rights to technologies that are relevant to us 
if our protected proprietary rights are challenged  invalidated or circumvented  it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and sales of our products 
we rely on technologies licensed from third parties 
for each of our product lines  we license some of our technology from third parties 
these licenses are generally limited in duration or by the volume of shipments of the licensed technology 
in addition  some of these licenses contain limitations on distribution of the licensed technology or provide for expiration upon certain events  such as a change in control of the company 
if the relevant licensing agreement expires or is terminated without our being able to renew that license on commercially reasonable terms  or if we cannot obtain a license for our products or enhancements on our existing products we may be unable to market the affected products 
for many of these technologies  we rely on the third party provider to update and maintain the technology  fixing errors and adding new features 
if the third party provider does not adequately update and maintain these technologies  whether due to changes in their product direction  their own financial difficulties  or other reasons  we would need to seek alternative means to fulfill the ongoing requirements for our products that incorporate the third party technology 
if we are unable to find alternative means of fulfilling the ongoing requirements  we may be unable to market the affected products 
we face risks associated with changes in telecommunications regulations and tariffs  including regulation of the internet 
the demand for our broadband products could be affected by rulings of the federal communication commission fcc and federal courts regarding services offered in the united states by telecommunications carriers to their customers 
in  the fcc released an order that appeared to provide some relief for carriers from unbundling requirements for broadband and new fiber facilities and equipment used to provide services such as dsl 
the fcc had also tentatively concluded that wireline broadband internet access services are not telecommunication services but rather information services  which would result in less regulation 
each of these matters  however  have been taken to various united states courts of appeals and are currently subject to various forms of rehearing  reconsideration or clarification 
as a result  the incumbent carriers  who represent the primary target market for our scream product line  face r egulatory uncertainties that could further delay their deployment of the equipment that will enable differentiated broadband services  until the end of calendar year or later 
also  if other rulings or regulations of the fcc diminish the attractiveness of offering such services  then service providers would likely have less need for our products 
changes in domestic and international telecommunications equipment requirements could affect the sales of our products 
in the united states  our products must comply with various fcc requirements and regulations 
in countries outside of the united states  our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities 
changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could impact our ability to market the affected product 
in addition  there are currently few laws or regulations that govern access or commerce on the internet 
if individual countries  or groups of countries  acting in concert  began to impose regulations or standards on internet access or commerce including ip telephony  our ability to sell our new scream and shoutip products or other new products would be adversely impacted if the regulations or standards resulted in decreased demand or increased costs for our products 
new restrictions on trade  such as in response to transfers of jobs from the united states to lower cost foreign locations  could limit our ability to purchase components from  or outsource functions to  foreign entities  which would likely make it more difficult to maintain competitiveness in the global market 
as a result of our current concentration of business to the federal government  we are more sensitive to these trade restrictions  whether tariffs  incentives  or government purchasing requirements such as the buy american act  than it would be with a more diversified customer base 
in north america  the former regional bell operating companies rbocs recommend that telcordia technologies  inc certify telecommunications equipment under its operations systems modifications for the integration of network elements osmine program in order to ensure interoperability with other network elements and operational support systems 
the osmine certification process is expensive and lengthy  and we have not completed it for our product lines 
failure to attain certification could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in fiscal  we commenced using foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant accounts receivable and intercompany account balances denominated in foreign currencies 
although we have established foreign exchange contracts for non dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in the united kingdom  france  germany and japan  exposures remain for non dollar denominated operating expenses in latin america  canada  and asia 
we will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary 
market value gains and losses on hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged 
the location of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquake and floods 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
these facilities are located near the san francisco bay where the water table is quite close to the surface and where tenants have experienced water intrusion problems in the facilities nearby 
in particular  unknown defects in the construction of our new facilities combined with the proximity to water may result in future water infiltration problems for net 
com 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosure involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we began using foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant accounts receivable and intercompany account balances denominated in foreign currencies 
market value gains and losses on these hedged contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged 
the net financial impact of foreign exchange gains and losses has not been material 
as a result  a increase or decrease in the foreign currency rates would not have a significant effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our policy is to not use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
a portion of our investment portfolio is composed of income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease of from levels at march  and march  indicated the fair value of the portfolio would change by an immaterial amount 
at march   the fair value of the short term investments was million compared to million at march  the fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures is sensitive to changes in interest rates and to the prices of our common stock into which it can be converted as well as our financial stability 
the yield to maturity on the debentures is fixed  therefore the interest expense on the debt does not fluctuate with interest rates 
at march   the fair value of the trading debt securities was approximately million
