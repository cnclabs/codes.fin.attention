introduction pctel  inc provides wireless connectivity products and test tools to cellular carriers  wireless internet providers wisp s  pc oem s  and wireless equipment manufacturers 
the company brings together expertise in rf platform design  mobility software  and hardware to ensure wireless excellence 
we simplify mobility  provide wireless intelligence  and enhance wireless performance 
additionally  the company licenses both patented and proprietary access technology  principally related to analog modems  to modem solution providers 
the company completed a two year transition from an analog modem company to a wireless company during there were five significant events in that transition  presented here in chronological order 
the first was the acquisition of cyberpixie  inc in may  which was the genesis of the company s segue product line of wi fi and cellular mobility software 
the second was the exiting of the dsp based embedded modem product line in june  and conversion of that technology to a licensing program 
the third was the acquisition of dynamic telecommunications  inc dti in march the dti product line of software defined radios measure and monitor cellular networks 
the fourth event was the sale of a component of the company s hsp modem product line to conexant in may of the company sold the product line but retained operating agreements and its modem patent portfolio for licensing purposes 
the fifth event was the acquisition of maxrad  inc in january the maxrad product line consists of wireless communications antennas for broadband wireless  in building wireless and land mobile radio applications 
during our management discussion and analysis  the segue  dti and maxrad products are collectively referred to as wireless products  and the hsp modem and embedded modem products as modem products 
pctel has an intellectual property portfolio consisting of over us patents and applications  primarily in analog modem technology 
it also has proprietary dsp based embedded modem technology 
the company has an active licensing program designed to monetize its intellectual property 
companies under license at the end of include intel  conexant  broadcom  silicon laboratories  texas instruments  smartlink and ess technologies 
the company has also asserted its patents and is currently litigating against com  agere  lucent and us robotics  who are unlicensed and the company believes are using pctel s intellectual property 
the company collectively refers to revenue from its licensing program as royalty and licensing revenue  with the exception of conexant 
the sale of the hsp modem product line to conexant and the signing of their licensing agreement occurred simultaneously 
royalty payments received from conexant are recorded as an offset to operating expenses as gain on sale of hsp modem products and related royalties 
the company is focused on growing wireless revenue and maximizing the monetary value of its intellectual property 
these will be the two key priorities for the company in growth in wireless product revenue is dependent both on gaining further revenue traction in our existing products as well as further acquisitions to support our wireless initiatives 
all of the company s product revenue has been wireless  starting in the third quarter there has not been enough history to evaluate whether there is significant seasonality in revenue between quarters for the product portfolio taken as a whole 
licensing revenue is dependent on the signing new license agreements and the success of our licensees in the marketplace 
new licenses often contain up front payments pertaining to past royalty liability  or one time payments if the license is perpetual 
that can make license revenue uneven between years as well as quarters within years 
an example is the intel license that was signed in december it is a perpetual license and yielded million of one time revenue both for the fourth quarter of and the year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflects the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
revenue recognition the company sells wi fi and cellular mobility software  software designed radio products  antenna products  and licenses its modem technology through its licensing program 
the company records the sale of these products  including related maintenance  and the licensing of its intellectual property as revenue 
the company accounts for revenue from its wi fi and cellular mobility software  including related maintenance rights  under sop software revenue recognition 
where the software license is perpetual and vendor specific objective evidence can be established between the software license and any related maintenance rights  the software license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software and the maintenance is recorded pro rata over the life of the maintenance rights 
where the vendor specific objective evidence cannot be established  and the only undelivered item is maintenance  the software license revenue and related maintenance rights are combined and recognized pro rata over the expected term of the maintenance rights 
where the software is sold on a fixed term license  the software license and maintenance revenue is recorded pro rata over the fixed term 
the company records revenue for sales of its software defined radio products when title transfers  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company sells these products into both commercial and secure application government markets 
title for sales into the commercial market generally transfers upon shipment from the company s factory 
products that are sold into the secure application government market are generally designed to a unique specification 
title generally does not transfer until acceptance for the first units and then upon shipment thereafter 
the company records revenue for sales of its antenna products when title transfers  which is generally upon shipment from the company s factory 
the company records intellectual property licensing revenue when it has a licensing agreement  the amount of related royalties is known for the accounting period reported and collectibility is reasonably certain 
knowledge of the royalty amount specific to an accounting period is either in the form of a royalty report specific to a quarter  a contractual fixed payment in the license agreement specific to a quarter  or the pro rata amortization of a fixed payment related to multiple quarters over those quarters using the operating lease method 
where a license agreement provides for a fixed payment related to periods prior to the license effective date the past and volume based royalties going forward  the fixed payment is recognized at the license effective date and the volume based royalties are recognized as royalty reports are received 
where the license provides for a fixed payment for the past and for a finite future period  to be followed by volume based royalties thereafter  the fixed payment is recorded under the operating lease method and recognized pro rata from the effective date through the end of the period covered by the fixed payment 
when a one time license payment is made for a perpetual license  with no future obligations on behalf of the company  revenue is recognized under the capitalized lease method upon the effective date 
in instances where the company provides non recurring engineering services to customers  the company recognizes revenue as the services are completed  using the percentage of completion basis of accounting in accordance with sab revenue recognition 
inventory write downs and recoveries inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and overhead costs 
inventories as of december  and were composed of raw materials  sub assemblies  finished goods and work in process 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and  based on our current estimated requirements  it was determined that there was no excess inventory  not reserved  as of december  and due to competitive pressures and technological innovation  we may have excess inventory in the future 
write downs of inventories would have a negative impact on gross margin 
accrued royalties we record an accrual for estimated future royalty payments for relevant technology of others used in our product offerings in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the estimated royalties accrual reflects management s broader litigation and cost containment strategies  which may include alternatives such as entering into cross licensing agreements  cash settlements  or both  based upon our judgment that such negotiated settlements would allow management to focus more time and financial resources on the ongoing business 
accordingly  the royalties accrual reflects estimated costs of settling claims rather than continuing to defend our legal positions and is not intended to be  nor should it be interpreted as  an admission of infringement of intellectual property  valuation of damages suffered by any third parties or any specific terms that management has predetermined to agree to in the event of a settlement offer 
we have accrued the amount of royalties payable for royalty agreements already signed  agreements that are in negotiation and unasserted but probable claims of others using advice from third party technology advisors and historical settlement rates 
as of december  and  we had accrued royalties of approximately million and million  respectively 
however  the amounts accrued may be inadequate and we may be required to record additional expense if royalty payments are settled at a higher rate than expected 
in addition  settlement arrangements may require royalties for past sales of the associated products 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock option plans using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  whereby compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of a share of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount that must be paid to acquire the stock 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  issued subsequent to apb no 
and amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options  but allows companies to continue to measure compensation cost for employees using the intrinsic value method of apb no 
the company does not expense stock options  but expenses restricted stock grants 
we record the issuance of restricted stock grants based on the fair value on the date of the grant and amortize the value over the life of the restriction using the straight line method 
as required by sfas no 
 we disclose the summary pro forma effects to reported income as if we had elected to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock based awards to our employees 
the calculation of the fair value of these awards is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
goodwill and impairment of long lived assets effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  under which goodwill is no longer being amortized 
through a third party valuation firm we assess the need to record impairment losses on goodwill and long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present such as a significant industry downturn  significant decline in the market value of the company or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
at least annually  we review the value and period of amortization or depreciation of long lived assets 
during this review  the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets are reevaluated 
we then determine whether there has been a permanent impairment of the value of long lived assets by comparing future estimated undiscounted cash flows to the asset s carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset s carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we provide for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are provided against tax assets which are not likely to be realized 
we currently have subsidiaries in japan and israel as well as branch offices in hong kong  taiwan and france 
our branch office in france is presently in the liquidation process 
in we liquidated our subsidiaries in the cayman islands 
in we liquidated our branches in korea and yugoslavia 
the complexities brought on by operating in several different tax jurisdictions inevitably lead to an increased exposure to worldwide taxes 
should review of our tax filings result in unfavorable adjustments to our tax returns  our operating results and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes  which involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations years ended december   and all amounts in tables  other than percentages  are in thousands revenues revenues product    revenues royalty and licensing    total revenues    change from prior period product change from prior period royalty and licensing total change from prior period wireless products revenue grew to million for  up from million in the increase was due to the acquisition of dti in march as well as revenue in the segue product line in that was introduced in modem product revenue declined to million in  compared to million in the decline is due the sale of the hsp modem product line to conexant in may the increase in royalty and licensing revenue in was primarily attributable to million of revenue associated with the intel perpetual licenses signed in december product revenues increased million in from the revenue increase was primarily due to stronger modem sales  in particular  one of our major customers significantly increased purchases in the second half of the year 
royalty and licensing revenues increased million in from licensing revenue in includes million from the settlement of the ess litigation as well as million from another large customer 
gross profit gross profit product   gross profit royalty and licensing    total gross profit    percentage of revenues change from prior period  cost of revenues consists primarily of cost of operations and components we purchase from third party manufacturers 
provision for inventory losses and recoveries are also included in the determination of gross profit 
product gross profit decreased million for compared to the prior year primarily due to our disposition of our hsp analog modem products to conexant and inventory recovery of million in compared to million in the remaining million decline is attributed to the growth in wireless products not being sufficient in the year to offset the sale of the hsp modem product line 
gross profit from royalty and licensing revenue increased million for the year ended december  from primarily due to the million of gross profit associated with the intel perpetual license 
gross profit increased million for compared to the same period in primarily as a result of the provision for inventory losses of million recorded in  an inventory recovery of million recognized in and the elimination of goodwill amortization of million resulting from write off of goodwill arising from the acquisition of the communications systems division 
gross profit as a percentage of product revenue increased from for to for for the same reasons 
research and development research and development    percentage of revenues change from prior period research and development expenses include costs for software and hardware development  prototyping  certification and pre production costs 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses decreased million for compared to the primarily reason is that the reduction in modem costs associated with our hsp modem product line that was sold to conexant was greater than the costs required to invest in our wireless products 
for  total research and development costs incurred were million  compared to million for research and development expenses decreased by million for compared to primarily because of decreased personnel expenses resulting from the reductions in force that occurred throughout fiscal year and the savings from the closure of the connecticut engineering center in june this decrease in research in development expenses was offset by our expansion of research and development efforts in wireless products and utilities 
in  we closed down our connecticut engineering center which focused on dsp based embedded modem products and shifted our research and development efforts to wireless products 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development costs decreased for for the same reasons as above as well as due to our higher revenues in fiscal employees in research and development increased from to from december  and to december  sales and marketing sales and marketing    percentage of revenues change from prior period sales and marketing expenses have declined by million from to  and by another million from to the declines are attributable to reductions in force related to modem products taken in  the second quarter of and the second quarter of employees in sales and marketing at december    and were   and respectively

legal expenses increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses decreased million for compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreased legal costs associated with the patent infringement litigation against smart link  ess technology and dr 
brent townshend  which were settled in may  february and march  respectively  offset by an increase in headcount from in to in legal expenses decreased from million in to million in employees in general and administrative increased from to from december  to december  and decreased to at december  acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development  percentage of revenues upon completion of the dti acquisition  we immediately expensed million representing purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
during  we expensed in process technology of million in connection with our acquisition of cyberpixie 
amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets   percentage of revenues amortization of intangible assets increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to the dti acquisition 
in march  we acquired the assets of dti for a total of million in cash 
the results of operations of dti were included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
since the purchase price exceeds the net tangible assets acquired  the difference is recorded as excess purchase price and allocated to in process research and development  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition as determined by an independent valuation firm 
we attributed million to net assets acquired  million to acquired in process research and development  million to the covenant not to compete and million to other intangible assets  net  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the difference of million by which the purchase price exceeded tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill 
in february  we acquired voyager for a total of million in cash and stock 
the acquisition was structured as a tax free reorganization and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
we attributed million of the purchase price to in process research and development  which we expensed immediately  million to intellectual property and million to workforce  both of which are being amortized 
the difference by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was million and was allocated goodwill 
goodwill was being amortized in and  prior to our adoption of sfas effective january   we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  under which goodwill is no longer being amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually 
an independent valuation firm conducted the annual impairment test  the result of which was that there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangibles 
as a result of the acquisitions discussed above  amortization of intangible assets increased to million for the year ended december  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  percentage of revenues in the second half of  we evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets  including intangibles acquired from csd  voyager and bluecom  and recorded impairment charges totaling million 
due to the economic downturn  we determined that csd s estimated future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of csd s long lived assets 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  we adjusted the carrying value of csd s long lived assets  primarily goodwill  to their estimated fair value of approximately million  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the estimated fair value was based on anticipated future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
we determined the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from voyager  as a result of the corporate restructuring and reorganization in  that there were no future cash flows expected from this business 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  we wrote off the carrying value of voyager s long lived assets  primarily goodwill  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
in regards to the goodwill and intangible assets acquired from bluecom  as a result of the corporate restructuring and reorganization  we determined that there are no future cash flows expected from this business 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off the carrying value of bluecom s long lived assets  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
in the years and there were no impairments to goodwill and intangible assets

these increases are primarily from the restructuring due to our disposition of our hsp analog modem products to conexant 
employees  both foreign and domestic  were terminated subsequent to the sale of the soft modem product line to conexant in may along with the related facilities closures 
this restructuring aggregated million consisting of severance and employment related costs of million and costs related to closure of excess facilities as a result of the reduction in force of million 
during  we reduced worldwide headcount by employees and announced our intention to move our headquarters to chicago  illinois 
the restructuring resulted in million of charges for the year ended december   consisting of severance and employment related costs of million and costs related to closure of excess facilities as a result of the reduction in force of million 
during  we announced a series of actions to streamline support for our voiceband business and sharpen our focus on emerging growth sectors

gain on sale of assets and related royalties gain on sale of assets and related royalties  percentage of revenues in may  the company completed the sale of certain of its assets to conexant systems  inc  conexant 
in exchange for the assets acquired from the company  conexant delivered approximately million in cash to the company  which represents million plus the book value of the acquired inventory and fixed assets being transferred to conexant 
conexant has assumed certain liabilities of the company 
the total proceeds of million netted a gain on sale of assets of million 
concurrently with the completion of the asset transaction with conexant  pctel and conexant also completed an intellectual property assignment agreement ipa and cross license agreement 
pctel provided conexant with a non exclusive  worldwide license to certain of pctel s soft modem patents 
in consideration for the rights obtained by conexant from pctel under this agreement  and taking into account the value of patent rights obtained by pctel from conexant under this agreement  during the period beginning on july  and ending on june   conexant agreed to pay to pctel  on a quarterly basis  royalties in the amount of ten percent of the revenue received during the royalty period  up to a maximum amount of million per quarter with respect to each calendar quarter during the royalty period  contingent upon sales by conexant during the period 
any such future payments by conexant to pctel in connection with the ipa will be recorded as part of the gain on sale of assets and related royalties in the statement of operations

such amounts are presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and are amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable shares 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering in  we recorded deferred stock compensation of million representing the difference between the exercise price and deemed fair value of our common stock on the date these stock options were granted 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation increased million for compared to primarily due to the grant of restricted stock to employees in we expect the amortization of deferred stock compensation to be approximately million per quarter through and decreasing thereafter  based on restricted stock grants and stock option grants through december  the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
if we grant additional restricted stock  the amortization of deferred compensation will increase 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended primarily due to the termination of employees in and the corresponding reversal of the remaining deferred stock compensation balance 
this decrease was offset by the additional expense related to the restricted stock grants in in and in future years  amortization of deferred stock compensation that will be recorded assuming no terminations and without allowance for future grants would be as follows december  amortization of deferred stock compensation other income  net other income  net    percentage of revenues other income  net  consists of interest income  net of interest expense 
interest income is expected to fluctuate over time 
other income  net  decreased million for compared to the same period in primarily due to the decrease in interest rates and change in short term investment balances due to net cash outflow for the asset acquisition of dti offset by the proceeds received from the disposition of a component of the hsp product line to conexant 
the short term investment balances have declined from to to million for the years  and  respectively 
other income  net  decreased million for compared to primarily due to lower average cash balances and decrease in interest rates in provision for income taxes provision for income taxes   effective tax rate the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future profitability 
during the third quarter of  we recorded million of provision for income taxes to establish valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of fasb no 
 accounting for income taxes as a result of uncertainties regarding realizability 
our effective tax rate was below the statutory tax rate of during primarily due to the recognition of benefits relating to tax credits for research and development activities in the amounts of million 
our effective tax rate was below the statutory tax rate of during primarily due to the recognition of benefits relating to net operating losses previously unrecognized as well as tax credit for research and development activities in the amounts of million

for the year ended december   dti earned an approximately million cash payout to be paid on may  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that were previously accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract

we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
we expect competition to increase in the future as current competitors enhance their product offerings  new suppliers enter the wireless connectivity products markets  new communication technologies are introduced and additional networks are deployed 
our client software competes with software developed internally by network interface card nic vendors  service providers for networks  and with software developed by large systems integrators 
increased competition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressures  the loss of market share and other factors 
many of our present and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and distribution of their products 
these competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the connectivity products markets  obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products  or otherwise gain a competitive advantage 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than those developed by our competitors 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing and new competitors as the connectivity wireless markets evolve and the level of competition increases 
our ability to grow our business may be threatened if the demand for wireless data services in general and wi fi products in particular does not continue to grow 
our ability to compete successfully in the wireless market is dependent on the continued trend toward wireless telecommunications and data communications services 
if the rate of growth slows and service providers reduce their capital investments in wireless infrastructure or fail to expand into new geographic markets  our revenue may decline 
wireless data solutions are relatively unproven in the marketplace and some of the wireless technologies have only been commercially introduced in the last few years 
we began offering wireless products in the second quarter of fiscal if wireless data access technology turns out to be unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment  we may not be able to generate enough sales to achieve and grow our business 
we have listed below some of the factors that we believe are key to the success or failure of wireless access technology reliability and security of wireless access technology and the perception by end users of its reliability and security  capacity to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of data  voice and video  the availability of sufficient frequencies for network service providers to deploy products at commercially reasonable rates  cost effectiveness and performance compared to wire line or other high speed access solutions  whose prices and performance continue to improve  suitability for a sufficient number of geographic regions  and availability of sufficient site locations for wireless access 
the factors listed above influence our customers purchase decisions when selecting wireless versus other high speed data access technology 
future legislation  legal decisions and regulation relating to the wireless telecommunications industry may slow or delay the deployment of wireless networks 
wireless access solutions  including wi fi  compete with other high speed access solutions such as digital subscriber lines  cable modem technology  fiber optic cable and other high speed wire line and satellite technologies 
if the market for our wireless solutions fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect due to this competition  our sales opportunities will be harmed 
many of these alternative technologies can take advantage of existing installed infrastructure and are generally perceived to be reliable and secure 
as a result  they have already achieved significantly greater market acceptance and penetration than wireless data access technologies 
moreover  current wireless data access technologies have inherent technical limitations that may inhibit their widespread adoption in many areas 
we expect wireless data access technologies to face increasing competitive pressures from both current and future alternative technologies 
in light of these factors  many service providers may be reluctant to invest heavily in wireless data access solutions  including wi fi 
if service providers do not continue to establish wi fi hot spots  we may not be able to generate sales for our wi fi products and our revenue may decline 
our wireless business is dependent upon the continued growth of evolving telecommunications and internet industries 
our future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the data communications and wireless industries  particularly with regard to internet usage 
the global data communications and internet industries are relatively new and evolving rapidly and it is difficult to predict potential growth rates or future trends in technology development for this industry 
the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that have resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services may not continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  the growth in demand for wireless and internet services  and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced data communications products and wireless systems  may not continue at its current rate or at all 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products for the wireless market  which meet the needs customers 
our revenue depends on our ability to anticipate our existing and prospective customers needs and develop products that address those needs 
our future success will depend on our ability to introduce new products for the wireless market  anticipate improvements and enhancements in wireless technology and wireless standards  and to develop products that are competitive in the rapidly changing wireless industry 
introduction of new products and product enhancements will require coordination of our efforts with those of our customers  suppliers  and manufacturers to rapidly achieve volume production 
if we fail to coordinate these efforts  develop product enhancements or introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers as scheduled  our operating results will be materially and adversely affected and our business and prospects will be harmed 
we cannot assure you that product introductions will meet the anticipated release schedules or that our wireless products will be competitive in the market 
furthermore  given the emerging nature of the wireless market  there can be no assurance our products and technology will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies 
we may experience integration or other problems with potential acquisitions  which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
new acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders  and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we may in the future make acquisitions of  or large investments in  businesses that offer products  services  and technologies that we believe would complement our products or services  including wireless products and technology 
we may also make acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels 
even if we were to announce an acquisition  we may not be able to complete it 
additionally  any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks  including difficulty in integrating the technology  operations or work force of the acquired business with our existing business  disruption of our on going business  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel  and impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill  and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets 
we expect that future acquisitions could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock  this would further dilute our existing stockholders 
we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our recent acquisitions of dynamic telecommunications  inc 
and maxrad  inc 
we acquired dynamic telecommunications  inc in march and maxrad  inc 
in january of as part of our continuing efforts to expand our wireless line and product offerings 
we may experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
dynamic telecommunication s product line utilizes software defined radio technology to optimize and plan wireless networks and maxrad s business is the design and manufacture of antenna products and accessories used in wireless systems 
these acquisitions represent a significant expansion of and new direction for our wireless business 
potential risks with these acquisitions include successfully developing and marketing security related applications for the software defined radio technology of dynamic telecommunications  the loss or decrease in orders of one or more of the major customers of maxrad or dynamic telecommunications 
reduction or delay of capital expenditures by wireless operators for network deployments extensions of existing wireless networks and network technologies as well as g and g technologies  decrease in demand for wireless devices that use maxrad or dynamic telecommunications products  failure to develop effective distribution capability for products purchased by the government  problems related to the operation of maxrad s assembly facilities in china  difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel  operations  technologies or products  and migration of network test and measurement functions into wireless infrastructure as a standard part of product offerings 
furthermore  under the asset purchase agreement  pctel has an earn out obligation to pay additional consideration to dynamic telecommunications if the dti product line meets specified earnings targets 
any such earn out payments may be paid  at our option  in cash or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if the earn out payments are paid in common stock  this would dilute our existing stockholders 
our gross margins may vary based on the mix of sales of our products and licenses of our intellectual property  and these variations may cause our net income to decline 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from our software based connectivity products 
we expect gross margins on newly introduced products generally to be higher than our existing products 
however  due in part to the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs  we expect gross margins from both existing and future products to decrease over time 
in addition  licensing revenues from our intellectual property historically have provided higher margins than our product sales 
changes in the mix of products sold and the percentage of our sales in any quarter attributable to products as compared to licensing revenues could cause our quarterly results to vary and could result in a decrease in gross margins and net income 
any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products 
sales cycles for our products with major customers are lengthy  often lasting nine months or longer 
in addition  it can take an additional nine months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons  including our original equipment manufacturer customers and carriers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products  over which we have no control  before placing a purchase order  the commercial introduction of our products by an original equipment manufacturer and carriers is typically limited during the initial release to evaluate product performance  the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders 
the lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult 
in addition  the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases 
if customer cancellations or product changes were to occur  this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses 
our revenues may fluctuate each quarter due to both domestic and international seasonal trends 
the connectivity products market is too new for us to be able to predict seasonal revenue patterns 
we do anticipate seasonal demand for the segue tm softap product as volumes tend to ramp up to support year end customer sales 
such patterns are also true for wireless test and measurements products  such as dti s  where capital spending is involved 
we are currently expanding our sales in international markets  particularly in europe and asia 
to the extent that our revenues in europe and asia or other parts of the world increase in future periods  we expect our period to period revenues to reflect seasonal buying patterns in these markets 
we require technical cooperation with chipset manufacturers in order to realize our soft access point product 
failure to successfully secure this cooperation would impair our revenue from this product 
we rely on our ability to forge relationships with chipset manufacturers  in order to ensure that our segue tm softap software is compatible with their chipsets 
this relationship requires that source code be given to pctel or that chipset manufacturers undertake development activities to enable our softap capability 
there are many risks associated with this chipset manufacturers general unwillingness to partner with pctel  chipset manufacturers internally developing their own softap capabilities  chipset manufacturers not seeing the value provided by softap  and chipset manufacturers viewing softap as a threat to the hardware ap side of the business 
we generally rely on independent companies to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
if these companies do not meet their commitments to us  our ability to sell products to our customers would be impaired 
we have limited manufacturing capability 
for some product lines we outsource the manufacturing  assembly  and testing of printed circuit board subsystems 
for other product lines  we purchase completed hardware platforms and add our proprietary software 
while there is no unique capability with these suppliers  any failure by these suppliers to meet delivery commitments would cause us to delay shipments and potentially be unable to accept new orders for product 
in addition  in the event that these suppliers discontinued the manufacture of materials used in our products  we would be forced to incur the time and expense of finding a new supplier or to modify our products in such a way that such materials were not necessary 
either of these alternatives could result in increased manufacturing costs and increased prices of our products 
we assemble our maxrad products in our maxrad facilities located in illinois and china 
we may experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems at our assembly facilities  which could result in lower yields or delays of product shipments to our customers 
in addition  we are having an increasing number of our maxrad products manufactured in china via contract manufacturers 
any disruption of our own or contract manufacturers operations could cause us to delay product shipments  which would negatively impact our sales  competitive reputation and position 
in addition  if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products  we will have excess or insufficient parts to build our product  either of which could seriously affect our operating results 
in order for us to operate at a profitable level and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets  we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical  sales  support and other administrative personnel 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering  sales  marketing  financial  technical and customer support personnel 
if we lose the services of our executives or key employees  replacements could be difficult to recruit and  as a result  we may not be able to grow our business 
competition for personnel  especially qualified engineering personnel  is intense 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  background and industry experience 
as of december   we employed a total of people in our engineering department 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key engineering personnel  our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets may be impaired 
failure to manage our technological and product growth could strain our management  financial and administrative resources 
our ability to successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in rapidly evolving markets requires an effective management planning process 
future product expansion efforts could be expensive and put a strain on our management by significantly increasing the scope of their responsibilities and by increasing the demands on their management abilities 
to effectively manage our growth in these new technologies  we must enhance our marketing  sales  research and development areas 
we may be subject to litigation regarding intellectual property associated with our wireless business and this could be costly to defend and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights 
we have from time to time in the past received correspondence from third parties alleging that we infringe the third party s intellectual property rights 
we expect potential claims to increase in the future  including with respect to our wireless business 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may result in our incurring significant expenses and could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate what we currently believe are our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their merits or success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
this could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operation  financial condition and prospects 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us related to our wireless business could also force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using technology  products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property  obtain from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or redesign those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property  which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses 
if we are subject to a successful claim of infringement related to our wireless intellectual property and we fail to develop non infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  operating results could decline and our ability to grow and sustain our wireless business could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operation and prospects could be impaired 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors 
these claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management personnel s attention 
undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in a loss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
to date  we have not been made aware of any significant software errors or failures in our products 
however  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of customers or delay in market acceptance 
our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge us and the tax challenges result in unfavorable outcomes 
we currently have subsidiaries in japan china and israel as well as branch offices in taiwan and france 
our branch office in france is presently in the liquidation process 
in we liquidated our subsidiaries in the cayman islands 
in we liquidated our branches in korea and yugoslavia 
the complexities resulting from operating in several different tax jurisdictions increases our exposure to worldwide tax challenges 
risks related to our industry if the wireless market does not grow as we anticipate  or if our wireless products are not accepted in these markets  our revenues may be adversely affected 
our future success depends on market demand and growth patterns for products using wireless technology 
our wireless products may not be successful as a result of the intense competition in the wireless market  our relative inexperience in developing  marketing  selling and supporting these products 
if these new wireless products are not accepted in the markets as they are introduced  our revenues and profitability will be negatively affected 
our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies 
if we are not successful in response to rapidly changing technologies  our products may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the wireless data access business is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  short product life cycles and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  we have successfully introduced several new products 
both the cellular g and g and wi fi spaces are rapidly changing and prone to standardization 
we will continue to evaluate  develop and introduce technologically advanced products that will position us for possible growth in the wireless data access market 
if we are not successful in response to rapidly changing technologies  our products may became obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively 
changes in laws or regulations  in particular  future fcc regulations affecting the broadband market  internet service providers  or the communications industry  could negatively affect our ability to develop new technologies or sell new products and therefore  reduce our profitability 
the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission  or fcc  extends to the entire communications industry  including our customers and their products and services that incorporate our products 
future fcc regulations affecting the broadband access services industry  our customers or our products may harm our business 
for example  future fcc regulatory policies that affect the availability of data and internet services may impede our customers penetration into their markets or affect the prices that they are able to charge 
in addition  fcc regulatory policies that affect the specifications of wireless data devices may impede certain of our customers ability to manufacture their products profitably  which could  in turn  reduce demand for our products 
furthermore  international regulatory bodies are beginning to adopt standards for the communications industry 
although our business has not been hurt by any regulations to date  in the future  delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements may result in order cancellations or postponements of product purchases by our customers  which would reduce our profitability 
risks related to our licensing program our ability to sustain or grow our revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property is subject to many risks  and any inability to successfully license our intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may not be able to sustain or grow our revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property 
in addition to our wireless product lines  we offer our intellectual property through licensing and product royalty arrangements 
we have over us patents granted or pending addressing both essential international telecommunications union and non essential technologies 
in connection with our intellectual property licensing efforts  we have filed several patent infringement lawsuits and are aggressively pursuing unlicensed companies to license their unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
we have pending patent infringement litigation claims with com  us robotics  agere and lucent 
we expect litigation to continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
because of the high degree of complexity of the intellectual property at issue  the inherent uncertainties of litigation in general and the preliminary nature of these litigation matters  we cannot assure you that we will ultimately prevail or receive the judgments that we seek 
we may not be able to obtain licensing agreements from these companies on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages as a result of claims these companies have brought against us which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
litigation efforts related to our licensing program are expected to be costly and may not achieve our objectives 
litigation such as our suits with com  us robotics  agere and lucent can take years to resolve and can be expensive to pursue or defend 
we currently expect our intellectual property litigation costs to be approximately to million on an annual basis 
in addition  the allegations and claims involved in these lawsuits  even if ultimately resolved in our favor  could be time consuming to litigate and divert management attention 
we may not ultimately prevail in these matters or receive the judgments that we seek 
we could also face substantial monetary damages as a result of claims others bring against us 
in addition  courts decisions on current pending and future motions could have the effect of determining the ultimate outcome of the litigation prior to a trial on the merits  or strengthen or weaken our ability to assert claims and defenses in the future 
accordingly  an adverse judgment could seriously harm our business  financial position and operating results and cause our stock price to decline substantially 
we expect to continue to be subject to litigation regarding intellectual property claims related to our licensing program which could impair our ability to grow or sustain revenues from our licensing efforts 
as we continue to aggressively pursue licensing arrangements with companies that are using our intellectual property without our authorization  we expect to continue to be subject to lawsuits that challenge the validity of our intellectual property or that allege that we have infringed third party intellectual property rights 
any of these claims could results in substantial damages against us and could impair our ability to grow and sustain our licensing business 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
as a result  at least in part  of our licensing efforts to date  we are currently subject to claims from com  agere and lucent regarding patent infringement matters of the nature described above 
we have also been subject to claims from others in the past regarding similar matters 
in addition  in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights 
we expect these claims to increase as our intellectual property portfolio becomes larger 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may result in our incurring significant expenses and could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate what we currently believe are our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their merits or success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited  and any limitation could adversely affect our ability to sustain or increase revenue from our licensing program 
our ability to sustain and grow revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property is dependent on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our ability to enforce these rights is subject to many challenges and may be limited 
for example  one or more of our pending patents may never be issued 
in addition  our patents  both issued and pending  may not prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
com  us robotics  agere and lucent have currently pending claims seeking to invalidate one or more of our patents 
if a court were to invalidate one or more of our patents  this could materially and adversely affect our licensing program 
furthermore  some foreign laws  including those of various countries in asia  do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
we have accrued for negotiated license fees and estimated royalty settlements related to existing and probable claims of patent infringement 
if the actual settlements exceed the amounts accrued  additional losses could be significant  which would adversely affect future operating results 
we recorded an accrual for estimated future royalty payments for relevant technology of others used in our product offerings in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the estimated royalties accrual reflects management s broader litigation and cost containment strategies  which may include alternatives such as entering into cross licensing agreements  cash settlements and or ongoing royalties based upon our judgment that such negotiated settlements would allow management to focus more time and financial resources on the ongoing business 
accordingly  the royalties accrual reflects estimated costs of settling claims rather than continuing to defend our legal positions  and is not intended to be  nor should it be interpreted as  an admission of infringement of intellectual property  valuation of damages suffered by any third parties or any specific terms that management has predetermined to agree to in the event of a settlement offer 
we have accrued our best estimate of the amount of royalties payable for royalty agreements already signed as well as unasserted  but probable  claims of others using advice from third party technology advisors and historical settlements 
should the final license agreements result in royalty rates significantly higher than our current estimates  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
risks related to our common stock the trading price of our stock price may be volatile based on a number of factors  some of which are not in our control 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile 
the common stock price has fluctuated from a low of to a high of during our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  many of which are out of our control  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  outcome of ongoing intellectual property related litigations  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in our industry  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  mergers and acquisitions  and sales of common stock by our stockholders or us 
in addition  the nasdaq national market  where many publicly held telecommunications companies  including pctel  are traded  often experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of an individual company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against that company 
this type of litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
provisions in our charter documents may inhibit a change of control or a change of management which may cause the market price for our common stock to fall and may inhibit a takeover or change in our control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor 
these provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares  and as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts and may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
our charter documents do not permit stockholders to act by written consent  do not permit stockholders to call a stockholders meeting  and provide for a classified board of directors  which means stockholders can only elect  or remove  a limited number of our directors in any given year 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be affected by  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
further  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may drop 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to credit risks and interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio  which is comprised solely of  highly rated  short term investments 
we have investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted based on the duration of such investments if interest rates rise  while floating rate securities and the reinvestment of funds from matured fixed rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better  and money market funds 
we have accumulated a  and  unrealized holding gain as of december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned through maturity on investments held at december  we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to currency fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating all transactions in us dollars 
if the united states dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which are sales were denominated  our net loss would not have changed by a material amount for the year ended december  for purposes of this calculation  we have assumed that the exchange rates would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  however  arises in part from translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation gains for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively
