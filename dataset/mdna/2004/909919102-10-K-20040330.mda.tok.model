million increase in occupancy costs and a 
million increase in data processing fees 
the 
million increase in income from discontinued operations in was the result of the sale of valley in july united s results of operations for the year ended december were impacted favorably by record high mortgage lending volumes  an improved net interest margin and the sale of its majority owned commercial bank subsidiary  valley 
interest rates were relatively stable in  with a single 
decline of the federal funds rate by the federal reserve board in june united s subsidiary  heritage bank  experienced a significant increase in loan volumes in of million  a increase in net loans over in the current low rate environment  heritage bank has focused on its strengths as a community service bank to remain competitive and retain favorable client relationships

this resulted in a change in interest rate spread of 
from in to in critical accounting policies 
united has identified its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the allowance for loan losses 
united s allowance for loan losses methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations in establishing an allowance for loan losses that management believes is appropriate 
risk factors include historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  an analysis of the current loan portfolio  and the level of non performing and impaired loans 
an internal loan risk grading system is also used to evaluate potential losses of individual loans 
other factors include the future economic trends in united s markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries 
changes in any of the above factors could have a significant affect on the calculation of the allowance for loan losses in any given period 
therefore  a full analysis is performed by management on a quarterly basis to ensure that changes in estimated loan loss levels are adjusted on a timely basis 
another critical accounting policy of united is that related to the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

united adopted a market valuation approach in assessing goodwill impairment and will measure the carrying value similarly at least annually under the new accounting rules 
ongoing impairment analysis of the fair value of the remaining goodwill will involve a substantial amount of judgment  as will establishing and monitoring estimated amounts and lives of other intangible assets 
also as required upon adoption of sfas no 
 united ceased amortization of goodwill on january  at december  and  united had million and million of recorded goodwill see part iv  item notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires disclosure about stock based compensation arrangements regardless of the method used to account for them 
as permitted by sfas no 
 united has decided to apply the accounting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 and therefore discloses the difference between compensation cost included in net income and the related cost measured by the fair value based method defined by sfas no 
 including tax effects  that would have been recognized in the statement of operations if the fair value method had been used 
under apb opinion no 
 no compensation cost has been recognized for united s stock option plans 
had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent with sfas no 
and recognized over the vesting period  united s net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts dollars in thousands  except for share amounts as reported pro forma as reported pro forma as reported pro forma net income       basic earnings per share continuing operations 

discontinued operations

discontinued operations 





united has also identified its accounting method for securities available for sale to be a critical accounting policy 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses net of related tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
while fair values are determined per market quotes from independent brokers and not subject to management estimation  the carrying value of the securities is subject to market variations 
at december  and  the unrealized gain on securities available for sale to mark them to market was 
million and million  respectively 
see part iv  item notes to consolidated financial statements securities available for sale 
discontinued operations 
on july   united sold its majority owned subsidiary  valley  to marquette financial companies 
an after tax gain of  was recorded on the sale  and along with the results of operations of valley  is recorded within the consolidated income statement as net income from discontinued operations 
all previously issued consolidated financial statements have been restated to also disclose the assets  liabilities  and operations of valley as discontinued operations 
valley s discontinued operations resulted in income net of tax of  or 
per diluted share  during   or

per diluted share during unless noted otherwise  the results of operation of the discontinued segment are excluded from the following presentation and discussions 
the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements include additional presentation and discussions regarding the discontinued operations of valley 
net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the most significant component of united s earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets loans  investment securities  mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
this amount  when divided by average interest earning assets  is referred to as the net interest margin and expressed as a percentage 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in interest rates  the volume and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities expressed as a percentage is referred to as the net interest rate spread 
the following table illustrates the changes in united s net interest income due to changes in volume and changes in net interest income due to changes in rates dollars in thousands year ended december  vs

interest earning assets 
the yield earned on loans outstanding including residential mortgage loans held for sale during was compared to in and in decreased rates on loans more than offset increased volumes of loans from to  causing the total interest income on loans to decrease million in compared to million for and million in the yield earned on taxable securities decreased to in from in as longer term securities earning a higher rate have matured and been replaced at current  lower rates 
the average other interest earning assets balances remained virtually unchanged during when compared to  but the yield earned on these assets declined considerably 
the total yield earned on all interest earning assets declined to in from and for the years and  respectively 
as discussed above  the decline is due to decreases in interest rates  refinancing of higher rate loans  and the maturity of higher rate securities 
interest bearing liabilities 
the rate paid for each category of interest bearing liabilities was significantly lower during than during and the yield on interest bearing demand deposit accounts decreased to 
in compared to and in and  respectively 
the yield on savings deposits decreased to in compared to and in and  respectively 
average rates on certificates of deposit also declined to during from in and in as certificates of deposit matured during  they were either not renewed or replaced at lower rates 
borrowings had a decline in rate  volume and interest expense in when compared to for all interest bearing liabilities  the average rate paid decreased to in from in and in net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from million in  which as 
million higher than the net interest margins for the periods ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the following factors affected united s interest yields  margins  and spread when comparing the year ending december   to the same period for during both and  the national federal funds interest rate  and united s prime rate  experienced one decline of 
in june and 
in november this compares to when those rates fell times for a total decrease of 
in addition  both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have seen a change in the mix of their respective components 
interest spread and interest margins have both increased when comparing to  while yields and costs have declined under the same comparison 
loan volumes have increased in with a decrease in volumes of investment securities and other assets  whereas the opposite were the case in in both and  volumes of time deposits and borrowings are down with respective increases in volumes of interest bearing demand and savings deposits 
provision for loan loss 
united provided 
million for loan losses in compared to million in both and the slight decrease in the loan loss provisions in reflects management s estimate of the improvement in loan quality 
the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which is considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as of the reporting date 
future additions to united s allowance for loan losses and any change in the related ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing assets are dependent upon the performance and composition of united s loan portfolio  the economy  inflation  changes in real estate values and interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward adequate reserve levels 
non interest income 
in addition to net interest income  united generates significant non interest income from a range of retail banking services  including mortgage banking activities and service charges for deposit services 
non interest income increased by million  or  in to million compared to million in and million in  principally due to the continued increase in fees from the real estate production activity at heritage bank in and fees from record volume secondary market sales in were million  compared to million in and million in non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million in  and increased 
million  or  to million in salary and employee benefit expense increased million in and

nonperforming assets 
when a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  united s policy is to contact the borrower between the th and th day of delinquency to establish a repayment schedule 
if a loan is not current  or a realistic repayment schedule is not being followed by the th day of delinquency  united will generally proceed with legal action to foreclose the property after the loan has become contractually delinquent days 
loans contractually past due days are classified as nonperforming 
however  not all loans past due days automatically result in the non accrual of interest income 
if a days past due loan has adequate collateral  or is fha insured or va guaranteed  and management concludes that loss of principal and interest would likely not be realized  then interest income will continue to be accrued

adequate valuation allowances are required to be established for assets classified as substandard or doubtful in accordance with gaap 
if an asset is classified as a loss  the institution must either establish a specific valuation allowance equal to the amount classified as loss or charge off such amount

and 
at december   and  respectively 
deposits and borrowings 
united experienced a net increase in deposits of million or in as deposits grew to million at heritage bank in from million in the increase in deposits resulted from a combination of competitive rates on all deposit offerings  and heritage bank s commitment to community banking  both of which have attracted depositors 
lower interest rates offered on deposits in in part impacted the lower growth rate in deposits in compared to fhlb advances decreased million in to million from million in heritage bank was able to repay million in fhlb advances in and received proceeds of million on new fhlb advances  for a net decrease of million 
at december   the current established available fhlb advance credit line for heritage bank was of its assets 
the weighted average interest rate on fhlb advances was and at december  and  respectively 
advances from the fhlb are secured by pledges of fhlb stock and a blanket assignment of heritage bank s unpledged  qualifying mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and us government and federal agency securities 
during  heritage bank had a cash management advance cma credit facility with a maximum allowable advance of million  subject to available collateral limits 
the cma credit facility expired february  during the year ended december   there were advances and repayments made on the cma credit facility and there was no outstanding balance due as of december  the cma credit facility is renewable upon request by heritage bank 
united  at the parent company level  had a line of credit of million with a correspondent bank at an interest rate of over the federal funds rate  which totaled and at december  and  respectively 
this line is secured by united s heritage bank stock and expires october  interest is payable quarterly 
principal is payable at maturity

million  respectively 
heritage bank had established a federal funds line with a correspondent bank at december  the total line was million with a daily interest rate equal to the federal funds rate  which was at december  advances up to million were unsecured  and advances over million were secured by investment securities 
there were no amounts outstanding at december  the line was not renewed by heritage bank in asset liability management 
united s earnings depend to a large extent on the level of its net interest income 
net interest income depends upon the difference referred to as interest rate spread between the yield on united s loan and investment portfolios and interest earning cash balances interest earning assets  and the rates paid on its deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is further affected by the relative amounts of united s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in recent years  united s interest earning assets have exceeded interest bearing liabilities 
however  when interest earning assets decrease as a result of non accrual loans and investments in non interest earning assets  net interest income and interest rate spread also decrease and any continued decrease in the level of interest earning assets would generally result in a negative impact on earnings 
one of the primary objectives of united s management has been to restructure united s balance sheet to reduce its vulnerability to changes in interest rates interest rate risk 
depository institutions historically have suffered from a mismatch in the term to maturity of their assets and liabilities  with mortgage loan assets tending to be of a much longer term than deposits  the primary liabilities of depository institutions 
in periods of rising interest rates  this mismatch can render depository institutions vulnerable to increases in costs of funds deposits and borrowings that can outstrip increases in returns on longer term fixed rate loans and investments  resulting in a decrease in positive interest rate spread and lower earnings 
several strategies have been employed by united to minimize the mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
for the past several years  heritage bank has maintained a policy of selling the majority of newly originated long term to year maturity fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
these loans are sold at their outstanding principal balance  which is the prearranged contract purchase price  and therefore  no gain or loss is realized at sale 
united promotes the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions 
united also emphasizes investment in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
when maturities of loans increase  united offsets the increased interest rate risk with matching funds and maturities with fhlb borrowings 
the following table shows the contractual maturities of united s loans as of december  the amounts reflected in the following table give no effect to assumptions regarding loan prepayments or payoffs 
loans with variable rates of interest are classified as due when the loan principal balances are contractually due  not when the interest rate reprices

stockholders equity at december  was million  or of total assets  an increase of million from million  or of total assets  at december  at december   book value was per share 
the increase in stockholders equity is primarily due to net income of million for and the issuance of employee stock options and stock awards of 
million 
these increases were offset by the payment of million in dividends on united s common stock  treasury stock purchases of 
million  and a decrease in unrealized gain on securities available for sale of 
million 
liquidity and capital resources 
united s primary sources of funds are deposits  repurchase agreements  fhlb borrowings  proceeds from loan sales  and loan and mortgage backed securities repayments 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in a period of declining interest rates  it is anticipated that mortgage prepayments would increase 
as a result  these proceeds from mortgage prepayments generally would be invested in lower yielding loans or other investments which have the effect of reducing interest income 
in a period of rising interest rates  it is anticipated that mortgage prepayments would decrease and the proceeds from such prepayments generally would be invested in higher yielding loans or investment which would have the effect of increasing interest income

off balance sheet arrangements 
united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk 
united s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
united uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments outstanding at december whose contract amounts represent credit risk include unused lines of credit   commitments outstanding variable rate   unfunded commitments under bankcard arrangements  letters of credit   the majority of heritage bank s loans  commitments  and standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in heritage bank s market area  primarily central and western montana 
substantially all such customers are also depositors of heritage bank 
the concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth above 
the distribution of commitments to extend credit approximates the distribution of loans outstanding 
outstanding commitments and standby letters of credit were granted primarily to commercial borrowers as of december  and at december   heritage bank had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million  on family mortgages at fixed interest rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
since united s earnings depend on its level of interest rate spread  its primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk irr 
interest rate risk 
united has established a formal irr policy  and heritage bank has an asset liability management committee alco and an investment committee  which meet at least quarterly to review and report on management s efforts to minimize irr 
several asset liability management strategies have been employed by united to minimize its exposure to irr 
these include selling most newly originated long term fixed rate mortgages  promoting the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions  and investing in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
the alco committee utilizes an institutional funds management service detailed simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
the model predicts the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on assets and liabilities
