molded aspheres we have rights under a royalty free perpetual license to the precision molded optics process originally developed by corning  inc  whose business in this field we acquired in products manufactured using this technology include glass aspheric lenses  including wafer scale lenses  sub millimeter lenses  lens arrays  anamorphic lenses and hybrid optical components 
our molded glass aspheres are used in a wide variety of laser and imaging applications in optical data storage  high precision printing  barcode scanning  environmental monitoring  machine vision  sensors  laser to fiber coupling  and medical equipment 
we are aggressively pursuing new sales opportunities in  for example  the application areas of medical devices and anamorphic corrections 

table of contents we continue to sell aspheric lenses for various communications applications 
glass aspheric lenses and lens arrays are used to perform two major tasks 
one is the collimation of light as it emerges from the fiber 
the second major task is coupling and focusing light at the output of a laser diode to a fiber or waveguide 
glass provides high performance and wavelength stability over fluctuating temperatures 
isolators we have developed a family of products that utilize a proprietary micro fixture design and robotic platform processes 
this automated process allows for micro optics to be mounted in small transferable fixtures that are processed in arrays and converted into a variety of optical components and component subsystems 
this flexible platform is capable of producing a variety of finished products including isolators 
we are manufacturing a qualified family of free space  laminate and custom isolators 
we sell isolator assemblies for applications in all communications markets 
this line is based on a manufacturing platform that can address a wide range of customer specifications  while supporting lower cost applications 
sales of isolators improved in fiscal  and we continue to serve the communications market while working towards sales into other market applications 
collimators during  we began the development of products for the then emerging optoelectronics markets  specifically in the areas of fiber telecommunications 
our standard collimator products provide higher performance in back reflection and insertion loss and can withstand in excess of watts of optical power 
the process to manufacture these collimators uses patented laser fusion technologies and robotics 
these products may incorporate aspheric molded optics and gradium lenses 
during and  we expanded this product line  demonstrating to the telecommunication optical components industry that we can provide low cost products and solutions to meet their telecom related collimator needs 
beginning in  the telecom equipment market slowed dramatically  reducing the demand for the optical components segment of the market 
due to the decline of this initial market segment  we began investigating other opportunities incorporating our unique patented laser fusion technology 
we are currently developing high power collimator products for fiber laser applications and have introduced certain new collimator product features during fiscal in order to address those markets 
gradium lenses gradium glass was developed by us beginning in and is an optical quality glass material with axially varying refractive index  capable of reducing optical aberrations inherent in conventional lenses and performing with a single lens tasks traditionally performed by multi element  conventional lens systems 
typical applications include surgical lasers  high power yag lasers for welding  cutting and marking  defense market uses  and test and measurement 
because gradium glass can concentrate light transmission into a much smaller focal spot than conventional spherical lenses  we believe that gradium glass has the ability to improve the current standards of laser performance in some applications 
our growth strategy continues to be to increase our emphasis on key laser market niches in the us  europe and asia to establish the necessary products and partnership alliances to sell into these markets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we sold some of our gradium production equipment to an asian company as part of a licensing agreement whereby they will manufacture gradium glass for lightpath and distribute lenses to their own customers in asia 
this agreement was renegotiated in fiscal  whereby we obtain a royalty for their gradium sales and we will maintain us gradium production 
recently we announced a distribution agreement with a specialty distributor to further assist in obtaining penetration into the high power yag laser end market 

table of contents optical assemblies we are currently producing optical assemblies based on our proprietary technologies 
we are working to design  build and sell optical assemblies into the markets for test and measurement  medical devices  military  industrial and communications 
sales and marketing extensive product diversity and varying levels of product maturity characterize the optics industry 
product markets range from consumer eg  cameras  copiers to industrial eg  lasers  data storage  from products where the lenses are the central feature eg  telescopes  microscopes to products incorporating lens components eg  robotics  semiconductor production equipment 
as communications technology continues to move toward an all optical network  various optics are required for bandwidth expansion and improved data transfer 
as a result  the markets for our products is highly segmented and no single marketing approach will allow us to access all available market segments 
from fiscal to fiscal  the company s sales and marketing strategy was designed to capitalize on the growing demand for optical components for telecom 
since that time  there have been substantial changes in our organization  structure and sales strategies 
because we are relying on multiple markets and market segments to diversify our sales base  we have made necessary changes in our sales force and sales strategies  particularly in fiscal  to strengthen our sales presence in markets we deliver value to 
sales organization our sales staff is trained to promote and sell all of our product lines to our customers 
in order to be more accessible to potential customers we have divided our sales staff into the following territories us east coast eastern canada asia us west coast western canada europe us central in addition  we have formalized relationships with nine industrial  laser  optoelectronics and medical component distributors located in foreign countries and in the us to assist in distribution of our products geographically outside the united states and in highly specific target markets 
because the optics industry is highly fragmented  we utilize these distributors  certain catalog distributors  our own catalog and our internet site www 
lightpath 
com as vehicles for broader promotion of our products 
we make limited use of print media advertisements in various trade magazines and will participate in appropriate domestic and foreign trade shows 
trade shows we have displayed our product line additions and enhancements at one or more trade shows each year 
for example  we participated in photonics west in california in january we introduced two new products at that show as examples of how we believe lightpath can provide added value to our customers see new products below 
such a strategy also underscores lightpath s strategic directive of broadening our base of innovative optical components and assemblies 
these shows provide an opportunity to meet with potential customers  to distribute information and samples of our products and to discuss test results from samples previously sent 
new products during we increased our sales efforts in targeting gradium lenses to laser applications  particularly industrial laser markets where gradium lenses increase the quality of yag laser cuts and welds 
this effort included delivering gradium lenses in customized mounts and holders to make change out simple and quick at the laser head 
while so far modest  we have seen some increased market acceptance 

table of contents during  at photonics west  we introduced new large beam collimator designs that are ruggedized to meet the demands of non communications market applications such as defense  industrial  medical  and test and measurement applications 
as recently as fiscal  the target market for our collimator products was concentrated within the telecommunications field 
at the same photonics west show  we introduced our new circulight tm lens technology 
circulight is a small form factor optic that circularizes elliptical laser diode output 
applications are growing in various wavelengths including blue for use in many existing and upcoming products designed for the next generation of entertainment systems and industrial applications 
our efforts in new product development are to broaden our capabilities toward areas in addition to communications markets  where our customers ask for more demanding optical performance 
in addition to the products mentioned above  we are skilled at design and production of optical assemblies that combine two or more of our current components  such as molded aspheres and an isolator  into a subassembly 
we believe these optical assemblies  which solve multiple optical problems in one package  have produced higher gross profit margins for us than the individual components 
competition the market for optical components generally is highly competitive and highly fragmented 
we compete with manufacturers of conventional spherical lens products and optical components  providers of aspheric lenses and optical components and producers of optical quality glass 
to a lesser extent  we compete with developers of radial gradient lenses and optical components 
most of these competitors have greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than we do 
manufacturers of conventional lenses and optical components include corporations such as eastman kodak corporation  nikon  olympus optical company  carl zeiss and leica ag 
in addition to being substantial producers of optical components  these entities are also some of the primary customers for such components  incorporating them into finished products for sale to end users 
consequently  these competitors have significant control over certain markets for our products 
in addition  although these companies do not manufacture axial gradient lenses  and although we believe that we have substantial technological expertise in this field  these companies could rapidly pursue development of axial gradient products  in light of their substantial resources 
in addition  our products compete with other products currently produced by these manufacturers 
aspheric lenses manufacturers of aspheric lenses provide significant competition for our molded glass aspheric lenses in providing products that improve the shortcomings of conventional lenses 
aspheric lens system manufacturers include eastman kodak corporation and hoya corporation 
the use of aspheric surfaces provides the optical designer with a powerful tool in correcting spherical aberrations and enhancing performance in state of the art optical products 
plastic molded aspheres  on the other hand  allow for high volume production  but primarily are limited to consumer products that do not place a high demand on performance such as plastic lenses in disposable or mobile phone cameras 
molded plastic aspheres appear in products that stress cost as their measure of success over performance and durability 
to a limited extent  our gradium material competes with manufacturers of other gradient index lens materials 
currently  processes to produce gradient index materials include ion exchange and chemical vapor deposition  both of which produce small radial gradient index rods with limited applications 
manufacturers using these processes include nippon sheet glass  olympus optical company  and gradient lens corporation 
isolators we compete with a few specific players in the isolator segment of the components market 
these include namiki  tdk  tokin  kyocera  sumitomo and kaifa jds uniphase 
our strategy does not involve direct 
table of contents competition with the catalog offerings of these companies  rather  we focus our efforts on designing and manufacturing specialty and hybrid components according to particular oem specifications 
collimators there are currently only a handful of direct competitors for our collimating lenses and collimators 
nippon sheet glass currently supplies the majority of collimator lenses 
the collimator lens is a separate business from nippon sheet glass s primary product  automotive glass 
our collimator competes against existing collimator assemblies  which are produced by casix acquired by jds uniphase  dicon fiberoptics  samsung electronics  wave optics and oz optics 
there are also a number of companies that assemble their own collimators  such as jds uniphase 
some of these competitors have greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than lightpath 
manufacturing molded aspheres and gradium all of our manufacturing is done in a  square foot production facility in orlando  florida 
with unused space remaining in this facility  we believe our space is adequate to accommodate foreseeable needs of the company 
the facility features areas for each step of the manufacturing process including tooling and coating work areas  pre form manufacturing  and a clean room for pressing and integrated assembly 
the production facility retains an emphasis on automation  particularly in the isolator and collimator lines moved from california and new mexico  respectively  in fiscal the facility includes new product development labs and space that include development and metrology equipment 
the molded glass asphere manufacturing area includes lens pressing equipment  high precision mold production equipment  advanced metrology and inspection equipment and coating facilities 
the plant also features a tooling and machine shop  which can support new product development  commercial production requirements for our lens holders  and the fabrication of proprietary press workstations and mold equipment 
in orlando  we have furnaces to produce boules and glass coring equipment for our current needs of gradium for our sales in the us and europe 
we also obtain gradium boules from hikari glass in japan  from whom we have an agreement to obtain a royalty for their sales of gradium in asia 
we are iso certified 
much of our product qualification is performed in house 
our test and evaluation capabilities include damp heat  high low temp storage  and a thermal shock oven  which are representative of the equipment required to meet telcordia requirements and other customer required product specifications 
our new product development department has cad tools and technical support 
the continuing implementation of various statistical process controls spc s is being pursued to improve product yields and allow us to reduce costly manual testing operations 
quality control in manufacturing to ensure a quality end product is critical to our ability to bring our products to market as our customers demand rigorous testing prior to their purchase of our products 
isolators in our orlando clean room  our isolator manufacturing equipment includes dual beam laser welding stations  sub micron alignment engines  robotic assembly stations  automated dispensing systems and precision dicing equipment 
the primary benefits of our approach to manufacturing are i reduced costs as a result of higher yields and throughput  and ii product consistency as a result of eliminating manual labor 
we believe we are the only manufacturer of free space isolators currently using automated manufacturing 

table of contents collimators our collimator assembly workstations in our orlando clean room include our proprietary laser fusion and housing equipment  automated testing processes  and laser polishing stations 
subcontractors and strategic alliances we believe that low cost manufacturing will be crucial to our long term success 
in that regard  we have generally used subcontractors in our production process to accomplish certain processing steps requiring capabilities that are specialized and that we have never acquired 
for example  we presently use a number of qualified subcontractors for fabricating some lenses  polishing certain lenses where required  and coating them 
our proprietary gradium boules are produced by an asian partner under agreement with us  which remits a royalty to us for its sales to customers in asia 
this arrangement allows our product to gain sales exposure in asia and provides us with a second source for boule production 
we have taken steps to protect our proprietary methods of repeatable high quality manufacturing by patent disclosures and internal trade secret controls 
suppliers we utilize a number of glass compositions for the manufacture of our molded glass aspheres and lens array products 
however  one such glass is a glass composition licensed from and manufactured by corning  inc and represents a substantial majority of our molded aspheric lens production 
corning is currently our sole source for this glass composition 
we believe that a satisfactory supply of this corning composition will continue to be available at competitive prices  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
additional sources of other glass compositions are available  and we have been testing such compositions in the event that their use becomes economically desirable to serve certain markets  or necessary due to the loss of corning as a supplier 
base optical materials  used in both gradium and collimator products  are manufactured and supplied by a number of major optical and glass manufacturers 
optical fiber and collimator housings are manufactured and supplied by a number of major manufacturers 
we believe that a satisfactory supply of such production materials will continue to be available at reasonable prices  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
we also rely on local and regional vendors for component materials and services such as chemicals and inert gases  specialty ceramics  uv and ar coatings  and other specialty coatings 
to date  we have found a suitable number of qualified vendors for these materials and services 
we currently purchase a few key materials from single or limited sources 
the polarizing glass used in our isolator products is supplied primarily by corning 
to date  we have been able to acquire an ample supply of polarizing glass 
garnet and other crystals used in our isolator products are provided by a number of vendors  including sumitomo  tdk and triquint 
available quantities and adequate pricing of garnet is available in the open market 
we believe that a satisfactory supply of production materials will continue to be available at competitive prices  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
we rely on local and regional vendors for component materials such as housings  fixtures and magnets 
in addition  certain products require external processing such as brazing and metalization 
to date  we have found a suitable number of qualified vendors 
patents and other proprietary intellectual property our policy is to protect our technology by  among other things  patents  trade secret protection  trademarks and copyrights 
the products and technologies that we employ use patents that are both owned and maintained 
table of contents by us and licensed to us by others 
patents have been issued  and or patent applications have been filed  in the areas of glass composition  glass molding  gradient geometries  and certain production processes such as fiber attachment  robotic assembly and micro fabrication 
the first of our issued patents expires in  the remainder expire at various times through patent applications corresponding to some our us applications have been filed in the patent offices in europe and japan pursuant to the patent cooperation treaty 
under the patent cooperation treaty  a patent applicant may file one patent application and have it acknowledged as an accepted filing in as many member nations to the patent cooperation treaty as the applicant elects 
in addition to patent protection  certain process inventions  lens designs and innovations are retained as trade secrets 
a key feature of gradium glass is that  once fabricated  it does not reveal our formula upon inspection and  to our knowledge  cannot be reverse engineered 
lightpath is registered as a service mark in the united states and gradium and polycoat are also registered trademarks 
other trademarks are held out and used by us under common law  such as circulight 
issued patents owned or available to us may not afford adequate protection to us or may be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented 
patent applications relating to our products may not result in patents being issued 
patent rights granted to us for technologies that we may license in the future may not provide competitive advantages to us 
patents that are owned or licensed by us that are issued in one jurisdiction may not be issued in any other jurisdiction 
the validity of any of our patents may not be upheld if challenged by others in litigation or if such litigation alleges that our activities infringe upon patents owned by others 
others may have independently developed or will independently develop and patent similar or superior products and technologies  duplicate any of our products or technologies or design around our patents 
there may be patents issued to others that will adversely affect the development or commercialization of our products or technologies 
we do not have an insurance policy for patent infringement liability coverage for costs or damages relating to claims of infringement 
we could incur substantial costs in defending suits brought against us  or any of our licensees  or in suits in which we may assert that our patent or patents provide us with rights against others or in suits contesting the validity of a patent 
any such proceedings could be protracted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in defending our patent rights in any future infringement action 
if the outcome of any such litigation is adverse to our interests  our business may be materially adversely affected 
we do not believe that any of our products or processes infringe any us or foreign patent rights of any other party  however  our products or processes may infringe or be found to infringe on another party s us or foreign patent  or patent application 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until the patent is issued 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in infringement litigation brought by others  or in prosecuting infringement claims against third parties 
an adverse party claiming patent or copyright infringement might assert claims for substantial damages or seek to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which could effectively block the ability for us to make  use  distribute and sell products 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and customers 
however  our confidentiality agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
some of the confidentiality agreements that we rely upon will expire in the next few years 
others may independently develop technology or processes substantially equivalent to or better than our technology or processes and our trade secrets may otherwise become disclosed to or independently discovered by our competitors 
environmental and governmental regulation currently  emissions and waste from our present manufacturing processes are at such low levels that no special environmental permits or licenses are required 
in the future  we may need to obtain special permits for 
table of contents disposal of increased waste by products 
the glass materials we utilize contain lead and other toxic elements in a stabilized molecular form 
however  the high temperature diffusion process results in low level emissions of such elements in gaseous form 
if production reaches a certain level  we believe that we will be able to efficiently recycle certain of our raw material waste  thereby reducing disposal levels 
we believe that we are presently in compliance with all material federal  state and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits necessary for the operation of our business 
we utilize certain chemicals  solvents and adhesives in our manufacturing process 
we believe we maintain all necessary permits and believe we are in full compliance with all applicable regulations 
to our knowledge there are currently no federal  state or local regulations that restrict the manufacturing and distribution of our products 
certain end user applications require that the complete optical systems receive government approval  such as us food and drug administration approval for use in endoscopy 
in these cases  we will generally be involved on a secondary level and the oem customer will be responsible for the license and approval process 
new product development for many years  we were engaged in basic research and development that resulted in the invention of gradium glass and certain proprietary processes for fabricating gradium glass lenses 
thereafter  new product development efforts were broadened or acquired that led to the development of our capabilities in molded aspheric lenses  isolators and collimators 
today  however  as part of our cash conservation strategy  we conduct no basic research and development 
our efforts in this area are concentrated on product development to support existing and new customers in the design and manufacture of items in our three basic product lines lenses  isolators and collimators 
as a result  our present new product development efforts are focused on markets that include yag lasers  defense  medical devices  barcode scanners  optical data storage  machine vision  sensors and environmental monitoring 
we incurred expenditures for new product development during the fiscal years   and of   and  respectively 
we currently plan to expend approximately million for new product development during fiscal  which could vary depending upon revenue levels  customer requirements and market opportunities perceived 
employees at july   we have full time equivalent employees  primarily in florida 
any employee additions or terminations over the next twelve months will be dependent upon the actual sales levels realized during fiscal eight of our present employees are engaged in management  administrative and clerical functions  in new product development  in sales and marketing and are in production and quality functions 
additionally we have persons on temporary or contractor status 
we have used and will continue utilizing part time help  temporary employment agencies and outside consultants  where appropriate  to qualify prospective employees and to ramp up production as required from time to time

our business and the results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
there are forward looking statements in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we use words such as believe  expect  anticipate  plan or similar words to identify forward looking statements and any statement relating to plans  intentions  expectations or other forward looking expression is a forward looking statement 
forward looking statements are made based upon our belief as of the date that such statements are made and are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak as of the date of this report 
while we may make other forward looking statements either orally or in writing in the future  we do not assume the obligation to update any forward looking statement 
the following risk factors are intended to be cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
our fiscal year ends on june and references to years in this form k refer to our fiscal year ended as of june of the referenced calendar year 
a 
risks related to our business and financial results we have a history of losses and if we continue to incur losses our business may fail 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  and we had an accumulated deficit approaching million as of june  while our revenues increased modestly during fiscal for the first time since and our losses narrowed  we still will require higher levels of business in order to achieve profitability 
in fiscal years and  we experienced sharply reduced revenues due to the widespread softening of the us economy and the telecommunications industry in particular 
we experienced substantial order cancellations and abandonment primarily in fiscal and extensions of product shipment dates by our customers who adjusted their inventory levels in response to industry contraction 
while these cancellations and extensions adversely impacted our revenues and resulted in higher inventory levels than required to support our sales levels at that time  we believe we have largely worked through those matters 
our success in achieving higher sales levels and reaching profitability is now conditioned on our current business strategy and its interplay with the multiple markets that we now serve 
even if we achieve profitability  given the competition in our optical markets  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses if we are to achieve profitability 
in fiscal  as in fiscal  we made progress toward reducing our operating cash outflow 
however  the company is not yet self sustaining from a positive cash flow standpoint 
the company s cash used in operations was approximately million of the million used in the year for the fourth quarter of fiscal our fiscal operating plan and financial projections project sales growth  and improving margins  offset in part by increased operating expenses in all departments 
the projections show the potential for achieving cash flow breakeven during the course of the fiscal year 
however  the operating plans and financial projections may not be fully achieved 
if the projections are not met  we may have to either raise debt or equity capital or further reduce operating costs to maintain a sufficient cash balance to operate throughout fiscal factors which could increase cash used in future quarters include  but are not limited to  failure to extend recent sales increases into future quarters  actual declines in revenue  renewed collectibility issues with regard to 
table of contents accounts receivable  increased material costs  increased labor costs  increases in our annual insurance premiums for property and casualty  medical or director officer liability coverages  and increases in discretionary spending 
should we find it necessary to raise additional funds  we may find that such funds are either not available or are available only on terms that are unattractive in terms of cost or dilution of existing shareholders interests  or both 
in the event that we find it necessary to raise additional funds to sustain operations and we are unable to do so  we may need to take such actions as additional restructuring of operations to reduce costs  or to discontinue operations altogether 
should that occur  the realizability of our assets  especially inventory  property and equipment  intellectual property and our remaining intangible assets may be such that significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements would be required 
we may need external financing in order to fund our operations and plans for sales growth 
while we continue to take actions to reduce cash used in operations  there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash to fund our future operations and growth strategies 
as we did in fiscal  we may need to obtain external financing in the future 
we do not have any material commitments from others to provide additional financing in the future and there can be no assurance that any such additional financing will be available if needed  or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
in the event such needed financing is not obtained  our operations will be materially adversely affected and we could be forced to cease or substantially reduce operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financings  if available  may involve substantial restrictive covenants or require the pledging of substantial of our assets 
because of our dependence on a few key customers  the loss of any key customer could cause a significant decline in our revenues 
in fiscal and  intel corporation accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
in fiscal  finisar corp 
accounted for of our net revenue 
in fiscal we had two other customers that accounted for more than of our net revenue but less than 
part of our strategy in fiscal has been to gain key customer relationships of more significance and impact to generate higher revenues at lower costs 
this strategy has met with some success and therefore we believe that that our operating results will continue to be notably dependant on sales to a relatively small number of significant customers 
the loss of any of these customers  or a significant reduction in sales to any such customers  would adversely affect our revenues 
order cancellations and extensions of product shipment dates by customers can hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders that are subject to cancellation  modification or rescheduling without significant penalties to our customers 
in recent years  we have experienced material order cancellations and significant extensions of product shipment dates by some of our customers 
if current customers stop placing orders  or unexpectedly reduce orders  we may not be able to replace these orders with orders from new customers and our ability to achieve profitability will be adversely affected 
the majority of our current customers do not have any minimum purchase obligations  and they may stop placing orders with us at any time  regardless of any forecast they may have previously provided 
our new market penetration efforts are at an early stage of development and may not prove successful 
our efforts to diversify our sales to additional optical applications in multiple industries are still in an early phase and our current line of products have not generated sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
while we have fiscal s evidence of sales gains to cause us to believe our existing products are commercially viable  we anticipate the need to continue to engage in vigorous sales and marketing activities  including education  in order to generate market demand 
further  market feedback may require us to further refine these products 
development of additional product lines will require significant further development  testing and marketing prior to commercialization 
there can be no assurance that any proposed products will be successfully developed  demonstrate desirable optical performance  be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or be successfully marketed 
some of our products have not been demonstrated to be commercially successful 
although our optical lens products have been accepted commercially  the benefits of the gradium glass line are not widely known 
table of contents and must be introduced as we can afford in markets that we believe would benefit from the performance characteristics of gradium 
many prospective customers will need to make substantial expenditures in order to redesign products to incorporate our gradium lenses 
there can be no assurances that potential customers will view the benefits of our products as sufficient to warrant such design expenditures 
our collimator products have not yet achieved broad commercial acceptance  our isolator production capability and sales  while encouraging at this point  are only four years old  and some of our molded aspheres applications are new 
there can be no assurance that any of these will be commercially viable products or produce significant revenues 
further  there is no assurance that any products currently existing or to be developed in the future will attain sufficient market acceptance to generate significant additional revenues that are necessary for our success 
we must also satisfy industry standard telcordia testing on telecommunication products to meet customer requirements  as well as satisfy prospective customers that we will be able to meet their demand for quantities of products  since we may be the sole supplier and licensor 
we do not have lengthy experience as a manufacturer for all our product lines and have limited financial resources 
we may be unable to accomplish any one or more of the foregoing to the extent necessary to develop commercially successful market acceptance of our products 
our relatively short operating history may hinder our ability to accurately forecast revenues and expenses 
although almost years old  lightpath has only generated significant revenues higher than million per year since fiscal through fiscal  our primary activities were basic research and development of glass material properties 
because of this short and highly variable operating experience and the turnover in management in the last two years  we have in the past and may in the future be unable to accurately forecast our revenues from sales of our products  and we have limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to plan future operating expenses 
many of our expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if our revenue is lower than we project 
new product introductions will also result in increased operating expenses in advance of generating revenues  if any 
therefore  net losses in a given quarter could be greater than expected 
failure to accurately forecast our revenues and future operating expenses could cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  including cash flows  and may result in further volatility of or a decline in our stock price 
if we are unable to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers  our business may fail 
our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers needs and develop products that address those needs 
introduction of new products and product enhancements will require that we effectively transfer production processes from new product development to manufacturing and coordinate our efforts with the efforts of our suppliers to rapidly achieve efficient volume production 
if we fail to effectively transfer production processes  develop product enhancements or introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers as scheduled  our net revenues may decline 
our sales  gross margins  and market share may be reduced because of increased competition 
competition in optical markets in which we compete is intense 
many of our competitors are large public companies that have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  the market capitalization and cash reserves of several of our competitors are much larger than ours  and  as a result  these competitors are much better positioned than we are to acquire other companies in order to gain new technologies or products that may displace our product lines 
such acquisitions could give our competitors further advantages 
for example  if our competitors acquire any of our significant customers  these customers may reduce the amount of products they purchase from us 
alternatively  some of our competitors may spin out new companies in the optical component and module market 
these companies may compete more aggressively than their former parent companies due to their greater dependence on our markets 
in addition  many of our potential competitors have significantly more established sales and customer support organizations  much greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases  more developed distribution channels and broader product offerings than we have 
these companies can 
table of contents leverage their customer bases and broader product offerings and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
additional competitors may enter the market  and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future 
we expect to encounter potential customers that  due to existing relationships with our competitors  are committed to the products offered by these competitors 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
we compete with manufacturers of conventional spherical lens products and aspherical lens products  producers of optical quality glass and other developers of gradient lens technology as well as telecom product manufacturers 
in both the optical lens and communications markets  we are competing against  among others  established international companies  especially in asia 
many of these companies also are primary customers for optical and communication components  and therefore have significant control over certain markets for our products 
we are also aware of other companies that are attempting to develop radial gradient lens technology 
there may also be others of which we are not aware that are attempting to develop axial gradient lens technology similar to our technology 
there can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not develop technologies that are superior to or more commercially acceptable than our existing and planned technologies and products 
we anticipate further reductions in the average selling prices of our products and therefore must increase our sales volumes  reduce our costs and or introduce higher margin products to reach and maintain financial stability 
we have experienced decreases in the average selling prices of some of our products over the last three years  including most of our passive component products 
we anticipate that as products in the optical component and module market become more commodity like  the average selling prices of our products will decrease in response to competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us  our competitors or other factors 
if we are unable to offset this anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or product mix  our net revenues and gross margins will decline 
in addition  to maintain or improve our gross margins  we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products  and we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements with higher margins 
if we cannot maintain or improve our gross margins  our financial position may be harmed and our stock price may decline 
because of our limited product offerings  our ability to generate additional revenues may be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products 
we expect that net revenues from a limited number of products will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenues 
demand for these and other optical market products had declined materially in recent years  however  demand has improved during fiscal continued and expanding market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success 
we cannot provide assure that  once the communication industry and general economic conditions improve  our current or new products will achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect  or at all  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we don t expand our sales and new product development organization our revenues may not increase 
the sale of our products requires long and involved efforts targeted at several key departments within our prospective customers organizations 
sales of our products require the prolonged efforts of executive personnel and specialized systems and applications engineers working together with a small number of dedicated salespersons 
currently  our sales and new product development organizations are limited 
while we had some success increasing sales in fiscal with little growth in our sales staff  we believe we will need to increase our sales and new product development forces in order to further increase market awareness and sales of our products 
there is competition in our industry for qualified individuals and we might not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel and applications engineers we need 
if we are unable to expand our sales and new product development organizations  we may not be able to increase market awareness or sales of our products  which would prevent us from increasing our revenues 
if we are unable to make sales in a fragmented market our revenues may not increase 
the markets for optical lenses and laser components are highly fragmented 
consequently  we will need to identify and 
table of contents successfully target particular market segments in which we believe we will have the most success 
these efforts will require a substantial  but unknown  amount of effort and resources 
the fragmented nature of the optical products market may impede our ability to achieve commercial acceptance for our products 
in addition  our success will depend in great part on our ability to develop and implement a successful marketing and sales program 
there can be no assurance that any marketing and sales efforts undertaken by us will be successful or will result in any significant product sales 
our products have long and variable sales cycles which reduce our ability to accurately forecast revenues 
the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict because of the length and variability of the sales and implementation cycles for our products 
we do not recognize revenue until a product has been shipped to a customer  all significant vendor obligations have been performed and collection is considered probable 
customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating  testing and qualifying our products and our manufacturing process 
this customer evaluation and qualification process frequently results in a lengthy initial sales cycle often one year or longer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales and marketing and new product development expenses to customize our products to the customer s needs 
we may also expend significant management efforts  increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead time components or materials prior to receiving an order 
even after this evaluation process  a potential customer may not purchase our products 
we cannot predict the length of these sales and development cycles 
these long sales cycles  coupled with the uncertain effects of the slowdown and expected recovery in the us economy  may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter  which could continue to cause volatility in our stock price 
current and pending litigation may adversely impact operating results 
on may   the company commenced a class action lawsuit in the chancery court of delaware  new castle county the delaware action 
in that action  the company sought a declaratory judgment with respect to i the company s right to redeem its class e common stock on march  for 
per share  ii the right of the holders of class e common stock to vote at the annual meeting to be held on october   and iii for certification of the holders of class e common stock as a class and the named defendants as its representatives 
the delaware action was settled in fiscal with the final settlement agreement requiring the company to pay per share to each class e holder 
the settlement agreement permitted class e shareholders to elect not to participate in the settlement and thus was not binding on any class e shareholders who so elected 
approximately of the former class e shareholders elected not to participate in the settlement see texas action described below 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company distributed approximately million of the million estimated total cost arising under the settlement agreement 
on or about june   a small group of holders of class e common stock commenced an action in a state court in texas the texas action  asserting causes of action of securities fraud  common law fraud  breach of fiduciary duty  civil conspiracy  negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent inducement 
plaintiffs in the texas action made various allegations regarding the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the class e common stock and alleged misrepresentations by the company in connection therewith  and sought damages and equitable relief based upon those allegations 
management believes the allegations underlying the texas action are without merit 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the texas court granted the company s motion for summary judgment 
the plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the ruling  however  on october   the texas court denied their motion 
on february   the plaintiffs requested that the texas supreme court review the appellate court s decision 
on june   the texas supreme court dismissed the plaintiffs petition for review for want of jurisdiction 
we are unable to determine at present whether the plaintiffs intend to further challenge or appeal the texas supreme court s denial of their petition for review 
on july   the company and a director filed a motion for summary judgment as to all of the plaintiff s claims which was granted on october   and has been made final by the trial court on march  on march   the plaintiffs filed an amended notice of appeal of final judgment as to the company and a co defendant 
the company is also involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
after taking into consideration legal counsel s evaluation of such actions  management is of the opinion that their outcome will not have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents the company may from time to time become involved in other lawsuits and legal proceedings 
litigation is expensive and is subject to inherent uncertainties  and an adverse result in any such matters could adversely impact our operating results or financial condition 
additionally  any litigation to which we are subject could also require significant involvement of our senior management and may divert management s attention from our business and operations 
sales  political  currency and other risks associated with our international sales could negatively impact our business 
for fiscal  approximately of our net revenues were from sales to international customers 
our international sales will be limited if we cannot establish and or maintain relationships with international distributors  establish foreign operations  expand international sales  and develop relationships with international service providers 
additionally  our international sales may be adversely affected if international economies weaken 
we are subject to risks including the following greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  the impact of recessions or slow growth in economies outside the united states  particularly europe  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  unexpected changes in foreign demand in response to exchange rate fluctuations  certification requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
while we expect our international revenues to be denominated predominantly in us dollars  in the future a portion of our international revenues and expenses may be denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we could experience the risks of fluctuating currencies and corresponding exchange rates 
we also source certain raw materials from outside the united states 
some of those materials  priced in non dollar currencies  have risen in price due to a decline of the us dollar against non dollar pegged currencies  especially the euro  since this lowers our margins and reduces our ability to reach positive cash flow and profitability 
our business has been subject to fluctuations in quarterly results and continued fluctuations could negatively impact our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results 
revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
for example  as a result of revenues associated with any of our key customers  any cancellation of orders from a key customer could result in significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results 
quarterly results have also been and may continue to be affected by asset write downs associated with communications market weakness  our recent headquarters and plant consolidations and other matters  including negative cash flow 
we may issue additional securities with rights superior to those of the common stock  which could materially limit the ownership rights of investors 
we may offer additional debt or equity securities in private and or public offerings in order to raise working capital as we did in fiscal the board of directors has the right to determine the terms and rights of any debt securities and preferred stock without obtaining the approval of the stockholders 
it is possible that any debt securities or preferred stock that we sell would have terms and rights superior to those of the common stock and may be convertible into common stock 
any sale of securities could adversely affect the interests or voting rights of the holders of common stock  result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders  or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have no present plans to issue any common stock  convertible preferred stock or any other preferred stock but are seeking shareholder approval to do so up to million shares of our common stock class a without further specific shareholder 
table of contents approval thereafter  subject to possible nasdaq requirements and limitations which may be more restrictive than our stockholders approval  if obtained 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  subject to large price swings which we are not able to control 
broad market fluctuations or fluctuations in our operations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market for our common stock is volatile  the bid ask spread is usually large and the trading volume and activity is low and sporadic 
the trading price of our common stock has been and will continue to be subject to volatility in the trading markets generally and in our particular market segment  limited trading of our common stock  significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements regarding our business or the business of our customers or competitors  changes in prices of our or our competitors products and services  changes in product mix  changes in revenue and revenue growth rates  and other events or factors 
statements of or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate or expect to operate could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market as a whole  as well as our particular market segment  have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for the securities of many companies and which often have appeared unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
although our shares are publicly traded on nasdaq smallcap market  the trading market for our shares can be limited 
during the three months ended july   nasdaq reported trading volume for our shares averaged  shares per trading day 
we cannot forecast or control any material increase in the trading volume for our shares 
a lack of an active trading market for our shares could negatively impact stockholders ability to sell their shares when they desire and the price that they might obtain 
the fact that we do not expect to pay dividends may lead to a decreased price for our stock 
our board has never declared a dividend on our common stock 
we do not anticipate paying dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
due to us tax law changes in  dividends may be more valuable on an after tax basis as a component of investment return  potentially diminishing the appeal of holding our common stock 
it is anticipated that our earnings  if any  will be reinvested in sales growth activities for our business 
our management and principal shareholders control a substantial amount of our stock and may  therefore  influence our affairs 
if our management and a few principal shareholders act in concert  disposition of matters submitted to shareholders or the election of the entire board of directors may be hindered 
we estimate that management  including directors  and our principal shareholders shareholders owning more than of our common stock beneficially owned approximately of the aggregate common stock outstanding as of august  our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover 
in certain circumstances  the fact that corporate devices are in place that will inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and certain other agreements contain certain provisions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us 
these provisions include  but are not limited to staggered terms of service for our board of directors  the authorization of the board of directors to issue shares of undesignated preferred stock in one or more series without the specific approval of the stockholders  
table of contents the fact that in we adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of a right to purchase one share of series d participating preferred stock for each outstanding share of class a common stock 
the description and terms of such rights are set forth in a rights agreement dated as of may  between lightpath and continental stock transfer trust company  as rights agent 
a copy of the rights agreement and related documents were previously filed as an exhibit to the company s filings with the sec 
the establishment of advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings  and the fact that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our chairman  president or upon the request of a majority of the board of directors 
all of these provisions  as well as the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law to which we are subject  could impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
outstanding warrants  stock options and restricted stock agreements may inhibit our ability to accomplish future financings and adversely affect our stock price 
the existence of our outstanding warrants  options and restricted stock and the potential for sales of significant amounts of previously unregistered shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional financing or the prevailing market price of our common stock 
as of august  there were issued and outstanding  shares of our common stock  including unvested restricted stock grants for  shares of common stock  warrants issued in private placement and other transactions pursuant to which  shares of common stock are issuable  at an weighted average exercise price of approximately per share  and outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  with an average exercise price of approximately per share 
in addition   shares of common stock were reserved as of august  for issuance pursuant to future grants to be made under our amended and restated omnibus incentive plan 
for the life of such options and warrants  the holders will have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the price of the underlying common stock  with a resulting dilution in the interest of other holders of common stock upon exercise or conversion 
further  the option and warrant holders can be expected to exercise their options and warrants at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain additional capital by an offering of our unissued common stock on terms more favorable than those originally provided by such options or warrants 
of the total number of shares of common stock currently issued and outstanding  we estimate that there are likely a small number  if any  of unregistered shares of common stock outstanding  and only those which remain unvested under restricted stock grants may not be freely traded or may be otherwise restricted from trading under certain volume and other restrictions set forth in rule promulgated under the securities act 
we have agreed to certain limitations upon potential liability of our directors  which could prevent recovery of monetary damages 
our certificate of incorporation provides that directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to the company or its shareholders for a breach of fiduciary duty as a director  subject to limited exceptions 
although such limitation of liability does not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission  the presence of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation could prevent the recovery of monetary damages by the company or its shareholders 

table of contents we may have difficulty obtaining director and officer liability insurance in acceptable amounts for acceptable rates 
we carry insurance protecting our officers and directors and us against claims relating to the conduct of our business 
this insurance covers the costs incurred by companies and their management to defend against and resolve claims relating to management conduct and results of operations  such as securities class action claims 
these claims are extremely expensive to defend against and resolve  therefore  we purchase and maintain insurance to cover some of these costs 
we pay significant premiums to acquire and maintain this insurance  which is provided by third party insurers  and we agree to underwrite a portion of such exposures under the terms of these insurance coverages 
in recent years the premiums we have paid for this insurance have increased substantially 
during fiscal we have been able to renew our d o insurance for a reduction in premium over the prior year 
we cannot assure that  in the future  we will be able to obtain what we believe to be sufficient director and officer liability insurance coverage at acceptable rates and with acceptable deductibles and other limitations 
further  due to our available financial resources at the time the current coverage expires february  we may be unable to pay for or we may choose not to seek as much coverage as we believe to be sufficient 
failure or inability to obtain such insurance  or the election to accept less than we believe sufficient or none at all  could materially harm our financial condition in the event that we are required to defend against and resolve any future securities class actions or other claims made against us or our management arising from the conduct of our operations 
further  obtaining such insurance in an inadequate amount or obtaining none at all may impair our future ability to retain and recruit qualified officers and directors 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
we manufacture all of our products at a single manufacturing facility in orlando  florida  and our revenues are dependent upon the continued operation of this facility 
this facility is subject to a lease that expires in unless renewed pursuant to terms mutually agreeable to our landlord and us 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  hurricane winds and rain  electric power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan  and we do not have a backup facility or contractual arrangements with any other manufacturers in the event of a casualty to or destruction of the facility or if the facility ceases to be available to us for any other reason 
if we are required to rebuild or relocate our manufacturing facility  a substantial investment in improvements and equipment would be necessary 
we carry only a limited amount of business interruption insurance  which may not sufficiently compensate us for losses that may occur 
our facilities may be subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facility 
any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of blackouts  rebuilding  relocation or other business interruptions  including the aforementioned  could result in a significant delay or reduction in manufacturing and production capabilities  impair our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in reduced sales  lost revenue  and or loss of market share  any of which could substantially harm our business and the results of operations 
as an example of this type of risk  the company experienced an electric power outage at its facility caused by a storm named hurricane charley from the evening of august  to the morning of august  during this period  the company was without the use of its production capacity and lost approximately six shifts of production 
the company believes it will be able to make up this loss of production time during the course of the remaining six weeks of the fiscal quarter 
our business depends  in part  upon the efforts of third parties  which we cannot control 
part of our strategy for the development and commercialization of certain products entails entering into various arrangements with corporate partners  oems  licensees and others in order to generate product sales  license fees  royalties and other funds adequate for product development or to enhance commercial prospects 
we may also rely on our collaborative partners to conduct research efforts  product testing and to manufacture and market certain of our products 
although we believe that parties to any such arrangements would have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities may not be within our control 
there can also be no assurance that we will be 
table of contents successful in establishing any such collaborative arrangements or that  if established  the parties to such arrangements will assist us in commercializing products 
we have a non exclusive agreement with a catalog company to distribute certain of our products 
we have agreements with nine foreign and one domestic distributor to create markets for gradium and our other products in their respective countries or market segments 
there can be no assurance  however  that these parties  or any future partners  will perform their obligations as expected or that any revenue will be derived from such arrangements 
future acquisitions to add to our product  process or management capabilities may fail to produce the desired benefits and will likely be dilutive to existing shareholders 
we anticipate that in the future  as part of our business strategy  we may make strategic acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
in the event of any such future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  or incur expenses related to in process research and development and intangible assets 
any future acquisitions also could involve numerous risks  including problems associated with combining the acquired operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs or liabilities  diversion of management s attention from our existing business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired entities 
we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  which may harm our business 
the loss of  or our inability to hire  key personnel would reduce our ability to manage our business effectively 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive and non executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing and support personnel 
our inability to retain or attract key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our operations depend  to a great extent  upon the efforts of our management 
we also depend upon our ability to attract additional members to our operations teams to support our strategy 
the loss of any of these key employees would adversely affect our business 
we had full time equivalent employees on july  we expect to continue to hire selectively in the manufacturing  engineering  sales and marketing and administrative functions to the extent consistent with our business levels 
our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful 
competition for highly skilled personnel is intense 
we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs  which could adversely impact our ability to develop and sell our products 
we rely on the efforts of our chief executive officer  and the loss of his services could materially adversely affect our business 
our success will be largely dependent upon the personal efforts and abilities of kenneth brizel  our president and chief executive officer 
mr 
brizel is not bound by an employment agreement 
if mr 
brizel ends his relationship with the company before a qualified replacement is found  then our business  prospects and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents b 
risks related to manufacturing our products if we do not accurately project demand for our products  we will have excess manufacturing capacity or insufficient manufacturing capacity which can adversely affect our financial results 
we currently manufacture all of our products in our facilities located in orlando  florida 
while demand for our products seems to have improved in fiscal  we intend to operate at a right sized production level during fiscal while retaining flexibility to meet demand if it should increase in the near future 
we will accomplish this  in part  by maintaining some of our production workforce as temporary employees or contractors 
our failure to accurately forecast material requirements could cause us to incur additional costs  have excess inventories or have insufficient materials to build our products 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our materials requirements 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary materials 
lead times for materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for the materials at a given time 
if we overestimate our material requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our material requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our results of operations 
additionally  in order to avoid excess material inventories we may incur cancellation charges associated with modifying existing purchase orders with our vendors 
if we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability  our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed 
the manufacture of our products involves complex and precise processes 
our manufacturing costs for several products are relatively fixed  and  thus  manufacturing yields are critical to our results of operations 
changes in our manufacturing processes or those of our suppliers  or the use of defective materials  could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability 
in addition  we may experience manufacturing delays and reduced manufacturing yields upon introducing new products to our manufacturing lines 
we may experience lower than targeted product yields in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 
if our customers do not qualify our manufacturing lines for volume shipments  our operating results could suffer 
generally  customers do not purchase our products  other than limited numbers of evaluation units  prior to qualification of the manufacturing line for volume production 
our existing manufacturing lines  as well as each new manufacturing line  must pass through varying levels of qualification with our customers 
customers may require that we be registered under international quality standards  such as the iso series 
this customer qualification process determines whether our manufacturing lines meet the customers quality  performance and reliability standards 
if there are delays in qualification of our products  our customers may drop the product from a long term supply program  which would result in significant lost revenue opportunity over the term of that program 
we depend on single or limited source suppliers for some of the key materials in our products  which makes us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations 
we currently purchase several key materials used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited source suppliers 
we may fail to obtain required materials in a timely manner in the future  or could experience further delays from evaluating and testing the products of these potential alternative suppliers 
the decline in demand in the telecommunications equipment industry may have adversely impacted the financial condition of certain of our suppliers  some of whom have limited financial resources 
we have in the past  and may in the future  be required to provide advance payments in order to secure key materials from financially limited suppliers 
financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers could limit the availability of key components or materials 
additionally  financial difficulties could impair our ability to recover advances made to these suppliers 
in some cases  suppliers may limit  restrict or cease their sales to us due to our financial status as evidenced by our filings as a public company 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these materials  or the inability to obtain these materials from 
table of contents alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time  would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders  negatively affecting our business 
our products may contain unknown defects which would adversely affect our business 
some of our products are designed to be deployed in large and complex optical networks 
because of the nature of these products  they can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in networks for long periods of time 
our fiber optic products may contain undetected defects when first introduced or as new versions are released  and our customers may discover defects in our products only after they have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  our products often are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
if we are unable to fix defects or other problems  we could experience  among other things loss of customers  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal actions by our customers or third parties 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could cause our net revenues to decline or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business 
we face product liability risks which could adversely affect our business 
the sale of our optical products involve the inherent risk of product liability claims by others 
we do not currently maintain product liability insurance coverage 
product liability insurance is expensive  subject to various coverage exclusions and may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us if we decide to procure such insurance in the future 
moreover  the amount and scope of any coverage may be inadequate to protect us in the event that a product liability claim is successfully asserted 
should any such claim be asserted and successfully litigated by an adverse party  there could be a material adverse effect to our financial position and results of operations 
c 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  we may be unable to compete effectively 
we believe that our patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position  and we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
although we have devoted substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our intellectual property rights  the actions taken by us may be inadequate to prevent imitation or improper use of our products by others or to prevent others from claiming violations of their intellectual property rights by us 
in addition  we cannot assure that our patent applications will be approved  that any patents that we may be issued will protect our intellectual property or that third parties will not challenge any issued patents 
other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
we also rely on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions with our employees  consultants and corporate partners to protect our proprietary rights  but we cannot assure the compliance by such parties with their confidentiality obligations  which could be very time consuming and expensive to enforce 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce our patents  copyrights  and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation can be time consuming  distracting to management  expensive and difficult to predict 
our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operation 

table of contents we do not have patent protection for our formulas and processes  and a loss of ownership of any of our formulas and processes would negatively impact our business 
we believe that we own our formulas and processes 
however  we have not sought  and do not intend to seek  patent protection for all of our formulas and processes 
instead  we rely on the complexity of our formulas and processes  trade secrecy laws  and employee confidentiality agreements 
however  we cannot assure you that other companies will not acquire our confidential information or trade secrets or will not independently develop equivalent or superior products or technology and obtain patent or similar rights 
although we believe that our formulas and processes have been independently developed and do not infringe the patents or rights of others  a variety of components of our processes could infringe existing or future patents  in which event we may be required to modify our processes or obtain a license 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in a timely manner or upon acceptable terms and conditions and the failure to do either of the foregoing would negatively affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation which could adversely affect our business 
we anticipate  based on the size and sophistication of our competitors and the history of rapid technological advances in our industry  that several competitors may have patent applications in progress in the united states or in foreign countries that  if issued  could relate to products similar to ours 
if such patents were to be issued  the patent holders or licensees may assert infringement claims against us or claim that we have violated other intellectual property rights 
these claims and any resulting lawsuits  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights 
the lawsuits  regardless of their merits  could be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following  any of which could harm our business stop selling  incorporating or using our products that use the disputed intellectual property  obtain from third parties a license to sell or use the disputed technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign our products that use the disputed intellectual property 
necessary licenses of third party technology may not be available to us or may be very expensive 
from time to time we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
we can provide no assurance that third party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the inability to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  either of which could seriously harm our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
on february   the university of florida research foundation  inc uf notified us that we were in default under the terms of the amended and restated license agreement uf agreement for failure to pay certain back royalties and in april notified us that they had terminated the uf agreement 
uf claims that we owe  in unpaid royalties 
while we dispute the amount owed and have been in discussion with uf about the matter  we do not believe that the termination of the uf agreement has materially adversely affected our business since the licensed technology had never generated annual sales in excess of of our total revenues from a single customer who had previously notified us that they were ceasing purchase of the product 
the company and uf are in continued discussions about this matter 

table of contents item properties the company occupies a  square foot facility in orlando  florida 
the orlando facility includes a  square foot clean room and  square feet used for storage 
lease terms on the florida facility call for monthly rental payments of approximately  until november  which includes all charges  including common area maintenance  escalation  and certain pass throughs of taxes and other operating costs 
at june   all of the company s physical assets  employees and operations were conducted from this facility  except for territorial sales personnel who office from their homes for the company to serve their geographical territories 
the company believes that this facility is suitable and adequate for its immediate business needs and for up to two additional years 
we previously leased an  square foot facility for office space and research and development in warren  new jersey  which we closed in fiscal we are obligated to make monthly rental payments of approximately  until may as of september  the company assigned this lease to a new tenant with the landlord s approval but we remain currently obligated to make monthly payments to the new tenant of approximately  until may item legal proceedings on may   the company commenced a class action lawsuit in the chancery court of delaware  new castle county the delaware action 
in that action  the company sought a declaratory judgment with respect to i the company s right to redeem its class e common stock on march  for 
per share  ii the right of the holders of class e common stock to vote at the annual meeting to be held on october   and iii for certification of the holders of class e common stock as a class and the named defendants as its representatives 
the delaware action was settled in fiscal with the final settlement agreement requiring the company to pay per share to each class e holder 
the settlement agreement permitted class e shareholders to elect not to participate in the settlement and thus was not binding on any class e shareholders who so elected 
approximately of the former class e shareholders elected not to participate in the settlement see texas action described below 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company distributed approximately million of the million estimated total cost arising under the settlement agreement 
on or about june   a small group of holders of class e common stock commenced an action in a state court in texas the texas action  asserting causes of action of securities fraud  common law fraud  breach of fiduciary duty  civil conspiracy  negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent inducement 
plaintiffs in the texas action made various allegations regarding the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the class e common stock and alleged misrepresentations by the company in connection therewith  and sought damages and equitable relief based upon those allegations 
management believes the allegations underlying the texas action are without merit 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the texas court granted the company s motion for summary judgment 
the plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the ruling  however  on october   the texas court denied their motion 
on february   the plaintiffs requested that the texas supreme court review the appellate court s decision 
on june   the texas supreme court dismissed the plaintiffs petition for review for want of jurisdiction 
we are unable to determine at present whether the plaintiffs intend to further challenge or appeal the texas supreme court s denial of their petition for review 
on july   the company and a director filed a motion for summary judgment as to all of the plaintiff s claims which was granted on october   and has been made final by the trial court on march  on march   the plaintiffs filed an amended notice of appeal of final judgment as to the company and a co defendant 
the company is also involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
after taking into consideration legal counsel s evaluation of such actions  management is of the opinion that their outcome will not have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

liquidity and capital resources history from february when our ipo occurred to fiscal  inclusive  we raised a net total of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stocks  the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants on our capital stock 
we did not have any equity or debt financing transactions in fiscal or fiscal  however in fiscal we raised approximately million from the issuance of common stock 
our optical product markets experienced a severe downturn beginning in  which continued into and resulted in a significant decline in the demand for our products over that period 
in  we believe that some improvement occurred in demand for our products in several of our markets 
nevertheless  we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during this fiscal year 
we have developed our operating plan for fiscal and believe the company has adequate financial resources for achievement of that plan 
nevertheless  we will be managing against that plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met during the year  remedial actions will be initiated 
such necessary actions  in addition to cost controls and vigorous sales activities  may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the company or of some of the 
table of contents company s product capabilities 
it is also possible that the company may be required to seek additional external financing in fiscal  which may not be available on reasonable terms and could be highly dilutive to current shareholders 
the company has no firm commitments for any material future financing at this time and we have a cash balance of approximately million at july  we may still seek external debt or equity financing if it can be obtained in an amount and on terms that are acceptable to us 
cash flows cash used by operations during fiscal was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from fiscal throughout fiscal  on a comparative basis to  we reduced our cash expenditures through the favorable effect of the consolidations of equipment and facilities and significant overall reduction in employment 
cash use was also favorably affected in by operating improvements that generated a positive gross margin and other expense control measures 
while progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow in fiscal and  significant risk and uncertainty remains 
the company s cash used by operations was approximately million for the fourth quarter of fiscal and million for the month ended july the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections we have developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
factors which could adversely affect cash balances in future quarters include  but are not limited to  a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated sales growth  increased material costs  increased labor costs  planned production efficiency improvements not being realized  increases in property  casualty  benefit and liability insurance premiums and increases in other discretionary spending  particularly sales and marketing related 
in the event that we find it necessary to raise additional funds to sustain operations and we are unable to do so  we may need to take such actions as additional restructuring of operations to reduce costs 
should that occur  the realizability of certain assets  especially inventory  property and equipment  intellectual property and other intangible assets may be such that significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements would be required 
during fiscal  we expended approximately  for capital equipment in comparison to  during fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity 
the company s operating plan for fiscal estimates expenditures at similar levels to enhance or expand our capacity  however  we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances 
key performance indicators how we operate the company has continuing sales of two basic types occasional sales via ad hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations our turns business and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business with characteristics of the semiconductor industry 
in this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them  including complex multi component designs that we call engineered assemblies 
that is followed by sampling them small numbers of the product for their test and evaluation 
thereafter  should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need  we negotiate and win a contract sometimes called a design win whether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement 
the strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business  which is unpredictable and uneven 
a key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible 
we have several challenges in doing so maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability  including a high quality and responsive optical design engineering staff 

table of contents the fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume  commercial production for example  in the case of molded optics  this may be volumes over one million pieces per year they begin to work seriously to reduce costs which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers  even if sacrificing quality 
our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures in other words  because of our limited cash resources and cash flow  we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures 
despite these challenges to winning more annuity business  we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market  a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering 
additionally  we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the united states should they be unwilling to commit all of their source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources 
we also continue to have the proprietary gradium lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets 
our key indicators usually on a weekly basis  management reviews a number of performance indicators 
some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative 
these indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change 
they are mostly non financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line  production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product 
these indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per shift  which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time 
higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications 
the data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes 
the company believes that its non financial production indicators  such as those noted  are proprietary information 
financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro level busincss cycle sales backlog inventory levels accounts receivable levels and quality these indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below 
sales backlog going forward  sales growth will be our best indicator of success 
our best view into the effectiveness of our sales efforts is in our order book 
our order book equates to sales backlog 
it has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect quantitatively  our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively  what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date certain delivery 
we define our disclosure backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues 
this includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria 
generally  higher backlog is better for the company 

table of contents disclosure backlog  as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended approximate disclosure backlog q q q q q q note due to the consolidation of multiple accounting systems after  comparative data is not available for quarters prior to q we believe this general trend toward increase in the disclosure backlog is attributable to several factors better organized and more concentrated sales efforts a stronger general economy  including in products requiring optics such as we produce our efforts to increase the proportion of our business that is under larger or longer term orders and supply agreements  and new products inventory levels inventory levels are managed by the company to minimize investment in working capital and still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree 
while the mix of inventory is an important factor  including adequate safety stocks of long lead time materials  an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales  also known as days cost of sales in inventory  or dcsi 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dcsi measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows the company s dcsi for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dcsi days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average accounts receivable levels and quality accounts receivable levels are similarly managed by the company to minimize investment in working capital 
we measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms  which are generally days 
the most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days 
table of contents worth of the quarter s net revenues  also known as days sales outstanding  or dso 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dso measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows the company s dso for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dso days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average the table below presents certain of our significant contractual obligations as of june  the operating leases relate to real estate and are commitments that are expensed as paid per the terms of the related contracts 
contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in s less than year years years after years comments operating leases   real estate leases with monthly payments other restructuring and exit costs balance of payments due on new jersey lease assigned outstanding purchase obligations current purchase orders outstanding year ended june  compared to the year ended june  consolidated operations our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or compared to revenues for fiscal of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in our aspheric lens and isolator products 
while both represented increased total demand  the aspheric lens increases were from across several of the industries that we serve with that product line while the isolator increases were from just a few customers  mostly in communications markets  specifically data communications 
our operating plan for fiscal projects continued revenue gains from all product areas and all markets 
fiscal consolidated cost of sales of million was approximately of net revenues of million  compared to fiscal when our cost of sales was approximately of net revenues 
this improvement was caused by several factors 
primary among them was having the benefit of the consolidation in our manufacturing sites to enable us to operate without the overhead of severely underutilized facilities 
additionally  substantial work was accomplished to reduce materials costs and to rationalize the production lines when they were re assembled in orlando 
going forward into fiscal  the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and higher yields from statistical process control applications 
our operating plan projects higher gross margin levels in fiscal than we achieved in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by over million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower headcount for parts of the year  some driven by the site consolidations and some by job consolidations in orlando 
other improvements were realized from cost savings such as the reduction in our director and officers insurance premium in over our operating plan for fiscal projects business levels that will require selling  general and administrative expenses to increase  primarily caused by selected headcount additions and expected cost increases in certain items 
new product development costs were reduced by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal similar to sg a costs  this decrease was primarily due to lower headcount in this department for part of the year driven by the site consolidations that occurred in late in fiscal we increased headcount in new product development to support certain new product projects and to support customer requests for new or modified product designs as part of our sales and marketing process 
our operating plan for fiscal projects some increases in new product development spending in order to support increased quote and customer design activity as well as continue modest investment in new product projects 
in fiscal our amortization of intangibles decreased by approximately million to approximately million from approximately million in fiscal the most significant component of our identified intangibles subject to amortization relates to the developed technology molded aspheric lenses from the company s acquisition of geltech in fiscal that asset was determined to have a four year life at the time of the acquisition  which was accounted for by the purchase method 
that amortization will end after the first quarter of fiscal and amortization thereafter  in accordance with our operating plan  will be at a rate of approximately  per year 
we offered excess production equipment for sale throughout fiscal that was salvaged from our site consolidations in fiscal and we realized a gain of approximately  during the year on proceeds of  we do not anticipate further sales or such gains in fiscal other income and expense for fiscal contained several items that are generally not expected to be recurring we settled litigation in the third quarter of fiscal for gross proceeds of  to us  which was offset by legal costs of  for a net gain of approximately  we have no further litigation in which we are the plaintiff and therefore anticipate no such gain in fiscal our investment income in fiscal reached only  compared with over  in fiscal when available interest rates and our investable balances were higher 
our operating plan for continues to assume low available interest rates and modest investable balances and therefore investment income will be negligible 
the primary remaining balance in other income and expense is the amortization of the fair value of a warrant issued to a related party in early fiscal that amortization expense will be concluded after the first quarter of fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared with million in fiscal  an improvement of approximately million 
this million improvement in the current year was comprised approximately of gross margin improvement of million improved departmental operating costs of million reduced amortization of intangibles of million a lack of asset impairments compared with the prior year of million a reduction in reorganization and relocation expenses of million a prior year change in accounting principle of million 

table of contents year ended june  compared to the year ended june  consolidated operations our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or compared to revenues for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in laser component product sales of million or and a decrease in optical lens sales of million or 
this decrease was largely a result of an overall decrease in market demand for optical lenses and laser component products  primarily in the telecom sector 
in fiscal  consolidated cost of sales was approximately of net revenues  which is comparable to fiscal in which we reported cost of sales of of net revenues 
both years included inventory write downs million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs decreased by million from fiscal to million 
the decrease is due primarily to a million legal settlement accrual included in fiscal and a million decrease in stock based compensation 
in addition  the company has taken additional actions to reduce costs  including consolidation of the company s new mexico and california operating plants to its orlando  florida facility  and other targeted headcount reductions 
new product development costs decreased by approximately million to million in fiscal versus fiscal  due primarily  to reduced personnel and discontinuation of the research and development efforts directed at developing an optical cross connect switch 
we incurred several non cash charges during fiscal  including million related to the write down of the company s investment in lightchip  million related to the write down of the company s goodwill and remaining intangible assets from the horizon acquisition  million of asset impairment charges primarily from manufacturing equipment related to the isolator business  and million in amortization of intangibles from acquisitions  offset by the forfeitures of restricted stock awards resulting in a  credit to income in stock based compensation 
during fiscal  the company also recorded approximately million of reorganization and relocation expenses incurred in connection with its previously announced plans to consolidate its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities from new mexico to florida 
these expenses consist primarily of costs to dispose and move equipment to florida  employee relocation and travel expenses 
investment and other income decreased approximately million  to million from million  as interest earned on investments in fiscal declined due to lower available interest rates and a decrease in cash balances 
in addition  fiscal included a gain on the sale of assets other income of approximately million not present in fiscal interest and other expense in fiscal and fiscal were not significant 
net loss was million in fiscal included in the net loss was approximately million from the non cash charges described above  million in inventory write downs  and million in reorganization and relocation expenses 
this compares with fiscal in which we reported a net loss of million including million in non cash charges  a million inventory write down  million of charges related to a litigation settlement and related legal costs and million related to consolidation of facilities 
the million decrease in net loss from fiscal to was due primarily to the decrease of million non cash and other charges and reductions in operating costs  primarily in selling  general and administrative expense and research and development 
effective july   the company no longer amortizes goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  amortization expense decreased by approximately million for fiscal net loss of 
table of contents million for fiscal resulted in a net loss per share of  a decrease of per share compared to fiscal net loss per applicable common share of 
net loss applicable to common shareholders for fiscal of million included  attributable to a premium on the company s preferred stock previously outstanding 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to select appropriate company accounting policies  and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has identified the most critical accounting principles upon which the company s financial statements depend 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting principles identified relate to i revenue recognition  ii inventory valuation  iii long lived assets  and iv intangible assets 
these critical accounting policies and the company s other significant accounting policies are further disclosed in note to the company s condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of the product provided that persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists  title has transferred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
inventory valuation 
we regularly assess the valuation of inventories and write down those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to estimated net realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon the company s analyses and assumptions  including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecast or actual demand from customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs 
if demand is higher than expected  we may be able to use or sell inventories that have previously been written down 
long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in the company s market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
if facts and circumstances warrant such a review  a long lived asset would be impaired if future undiscounted cash flows  without consideration of interest  are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
once deemed impaired  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is  by its nature  a highly subjective judgment 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon the company s weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and the company s percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
intangible assets 
we generally obtain intangible assets in connection with a business unit purchase for example  in a business combination 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires 
table of contents the use of a specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus subject to significant judgment 
because individual intangible assets may be i expensed immediately upon acquisition for example  purchased in process research and development assets  or ii amortized over their estimated useful life for example  acquired technology  their assigned values could have a material affect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangible assets are subject to the same judgments when evaluating for impairment as other long lived assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued an exposure draft ed of a proposed statement  share based payments  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the ed would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method  preferably one called the binomial or lattice method 
the ed as currently drafted would be effective for awards granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal  for public entities that used the fair value based methods of accounting under the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes 
since the company is using and expects to continue using stock options in its compensation mix  the ed is likely to have the impact of increasing our reported costs for compensation which are classified as cost of sales  selling  general and administrative costs  and new product development costs 
it is not expected to affect cash flow unless we choose to partially or wholly replace stock options with cash compensation 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
and subsequently amended it with the issuance of interpretation no 
r in december this interpretation and its amendment addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on the company s consolidation financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires certain financial instruments that were previously classified as equity to be classified as assets or liabilities 
the provisions are effective for transactions entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that  in the future  we may find it desirable or necessary to seek external financing and we may enter into an agreement that would be governed by sfas no 
whereby the financing we receive cannot be classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lightpath s liquid investments were invested in money market accounts or overnight repurchase agreements until late august lightpath does not believe that the market risk related to these investments was significant 
in late august  we began investing much of our cash resources in short term taxable auction rate certificates arc s in order to improve our effective received yield on our invested cash by approximately basis points 
the arc s we have chosen have aaa ratings and  due to their short term nature day rate resets  we do not believe that changes in market interest rates of up to percent either up or down will have a material effect on the our results of operations
