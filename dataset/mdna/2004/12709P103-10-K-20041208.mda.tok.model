overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our is the leading supplier of high performance polishing slurries used in the manufacture of the most advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp is a polishing process used by ic device manufacturers to planarize or flatten many of the multiple layers of material that are built upon silicon wafers in the production of advanced ics 
planarization is a polishing process that uses cmp slurries and pads to level  smooth and remove excess material from the surfaces of these layers  while leaving minimal residue or defects on the surface 
cmp slurries are liquid solutions generally composed of high purity deionized water  proprietary chemical additives and engineered abrasives that chemically and mechanically interact with the surface material of the ic device at an atomic level 
cmp enables ic device manufacturers to produce smaller  faster and more complex ic devices with fewer defects 
we believe cmp will become increasingly important in the future as manufacturers continue to shrink the size of these devices and to improve their performance 
our cmp products are used for a number of applications  such as polishing insulating oxide layers  the tungsten plugs that connect the multiple wiring layers of ic devices through these insulating layers  and copper wiring 
we also develop slurries for direct shallow trench isolation  used to electrically isolate adjoining transistors 
in addition  we have developed and sell cmp slurries for polishing certain components in hard disk drives  specifically rigid disk substrates and magnetic heads  and we believe we are one of the leading suppliers in this area 
we are continuing to develop new and improved products for these applications as well as improving existing products on an ongoing basis 
in addition  we are developing polishing pads for use in the cmp process 
prior to our initial public offering in april  we operated as a division of cabot corporation cabot corporation 
in september we became a wholly independent entity upon cabot corporation s spin off of its ownership in us that remained after the initial public offering 
we have continued to focus on three key strategies  remaining the technology leader in cmp slurries  achieving operations excellence through improved product quality and consistency  and building and maintaining close customer relationships 
we believe that this  coupled with an expansionary period for the semiconductor industry  resulted in profitable growth for our company in fiscal revenue for fiscal was million  up from the million reported for fiscal  and net income increased by from the prior year 
in addition  diluted earnings per share in fiscal were  which represents an increase of from the reported in fiscal the following represents what we believe were important events for our business in fiscal we realigned and refreshed our executive leadership team in order to drive broad organizational development and increase overall leadership capability 
in addition  we transitioned to a global business team structure to provide a single point of accountability for each major application area 
we entered into a strategic alliance with nanoproducts corporation under which we acquired a minority equity ownership interest in the company in exchange for a million investment 
under this alliance we are collaborating to develop nanoscale particles for use in next generation cmp slurries  as well as other fine finish polishing applications 
we executed a silica supply agreement with cabot corporation  which provides better supply assurance  reduced cost risk and additional benefits related to quality that support our operations excellence initiative 
we established a multi year supply arrangement with a top semiconductor manufacturer to supply the majority of its cmp needs for polishing copper interconnects at nanometer technology 
we renewed our revolving credit facility in the amount of million  with an option to increase the facility by up to million 
we initiated a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock  primarily intended to diminish earnings dilution from the issuance of stock from the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we commenced design work on a new asia pacific technology center that will be constructed adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in geino  japan  which will provide polishing  metrology and product development capabilities 
we terminated our distribution agreement with a polishing pad manufacturer due to what we believe was a less than acceptable level of profitability 
we experienced increased competition and pricing pressure  and one large customer notified us of its decision to transition to another supplier of cmp slurry for polishing nanometer copper interconnects 
we launched a company wide six sigma initiative to reduce product variation  increase efficiency and productivity and reduce costs 
we believe that the asia pacific region continues to be the fastest growing region in the world for the semiconductor industry  and we believe that demand for our products will continue to shift to this region 
we have increased our focus in asia over the last few years by increasing the number of sales and marketing  technical and customer support personnel present in this region 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of we commenced design work on a new asia pacific technology center that will be constructed adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in geino  japan 
this facility represents our first research and development facility to be located outside of the united states 
this investment reflects the importance of the asia pacific market to our business and underscores our commitment both to continuing to invest in our technology infrastructure to maintain our technology leadership  and to becoming even more responsive to the needs of our customers 
we believe there are three cmp industry trends that are currently impacting our business 
first  we believe that rapid incorporation of cmp technology and growth of the cmp industry  combined with our customers desires to gain purchasing leverage and lower their cost of ownership  have led to much greater competitive activity 
second  as cmp technology has become more advanced  we believe that cmp technical solutions have become more complex  and leading edge technologies often require customization by customer  tool set and process integration approach 
third  as cmp technology has matured  we believe that semiconductor manufacturers processes have become highly sensitive to cmp slurries  and customers now demand a very high level of consistency and quality in cmp slurry products  which increases our costs 
as a result of these trends  we expect our gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be  plus or minus  for fiscal there are indications that will be a year of moderating revenue growth for the broad semiconductor industry  and possibly even a contraction 
the continued uncertainty makes it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for the industry or our business 
over the next several years  we believe that growth in emerging consumer connectivity and wireless technologies such as digital mobile phones  digital still and video cameras  digital television and portable media will represent the next wave in the semiconductor industry 
we believe that the increased emphasis on memory technology and the incorporation of advanced memory products into digital consumer devices will drive additional growth in the industry over the long term  in parallel with the industry s traditional emphasis on microprocessors for personal computers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to product returns  bad debt expense  inventory valuation  warranty obligations  other accruals  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts includes both a general reserve based on historical experience and an additional reserve for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial condition 
while historical experience may provide a reasonable estimate of uncollectible accounts  actual results may differ from what was recorded 
as of september  our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable 
if we had increased our estimate of bad debts by  to of gross accounts receivable  our general and administrative expense would have increased by million 
we maintain a warranty reserve that reflects management s best estimate of the cost to replace product that does not meet customers specifications and performance requirements  and related costs 
the warranty reserve is based upon a historical product return rate applied against sales made in the current quarterly period  plus an additional amount related to any specific known conditions or circumstances 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
as of september  our warranty reserve represented of the current quarter revenue 
if we had increased our estimate of general warranty reserve by  to of the current quarter revenue  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or if inventory is deemed unmarketable 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventory written off applied against inventory at the end of the period  plus an additional amount for known conditions and circumstances 
we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of inventory that is obsolete 
should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
also  the purchase cost of one of our key raw materials from one supplier changes significantly based upon the total quantity of in specification product that we purchase in a given fiscal year 
during interim periods we determine inventory valuation and the amount charged to cost of goods sold for this raw material from this supplier based on the expected average cost over the entire fiscal year using our current full year forecast of purchases of this raw material from this supplier 
we have entered into unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas and no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we have elected to account for stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
we disclose the summary of pro forma effects to reported net income as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of stock based awards to employees of cabot microelectronics as prescribed by sfas we have entered into a strategic alliance with nanoproducts corporation and acquired a minority interest in the company of in exchange for an investment of million 
although we do not own or more of nanoproducts  we have concluded that we have the ability to significantly influence nanoproducts operating and financial policies 
therefore  in accordance with accounting principles board option no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  we account for our investment using the equity method of accounting  which requires us to record earnings and losses of nanoproducts in proportion to our share of ownership 
we maintain an intercompany loan agreement with our wholly owned subsidiary  nihon cabot microelectronics kk the kk  under which we provided funds to the kk to finance the purchase of certain assets from our former japanese branch at the time of the establishment of this subsidiary  as well as for the purchase of land adjacent to our geino  japan facility  which is part of the kk since settlement of the note is expected in the foreseeable future  and our subsidiary has been consistently making timely payments on the loan  the loan is considered a foreign currency transaction under fasb statement no 
 foreign currency translation 
therefore the associated foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in earnings rather than being deferred in the cumulative translation account in other comprehensive income 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research and development selling and marketing general and administrative litigation settlement amortization of intangibles operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september  versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to an increase in sales volume and million was due to an increase in weighted average selling price resulting from both a higher valued product mix and favorable foreign exchange rate changes  which more than offset selective price reductions that were granted to certain customers 
revenue for fiscal year would have been million lower had the average exchange rates for the japanese yen and euro during the period held constant with the prior year s average rates 
also  in june  we began selling directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia 
these customers previously had been serviced through metron  a third party distributor 
during this transition period we discontinued sales to metron while they drew down their inventory of our products  which we believe resulted in an adverse revenue impact of million during our third quarter of fiscal while has been a growth year for the semiconductor industry  there are indications that will be a year of moderating revenue growth and possibly even a contraction  which we would expect to have an impact on our business 
we expect continued competition as other companies attempt to enter the cmp business 
we also expect pricing pressure to continue due to customer desires to gain purchasing leverage and lower their cost of ownership 
the cyclical nature of and continued uncertainty in the semiconductor industry makes it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume and million was due to higher average costs per gallon resulting from increased fixed manufacturing costs and higher costs from lower yields associated with meeting our customers more stringent product quality requirements  as well as from transition costs associated with the termination of a polishing pad distribution agreement 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of million of expense incurred in fiscal related to a raw material supply agreement for a polishing pad technology that was previously under development but is no longer being pursued 
fumed metal oxides  both fumed silica and fumed alumina  are significant raw materials we use in many of our cmp slurries 
from the time of our initial public offering in april to january  we purchased fumed silica and fumed alumina under a fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation that was due to expire in june in january we entered into a fumed silica supply agreement with cabot corporation  which replaces the original fumed metal oxide agreement with respect to fumed silica  and accordingly amended our fumed metal oxide agreement with respect to its fumed silica terms such that the agreement now only applies to fumed alumina and runs through its original term of june this fumed silica supply agreement provides for improved supply assurance  reduces our risk to rising raw material costs and incorporates increased quality performance measures and requirements that support our initiative to increase product quality and consistency 
this agreement has an initial six year term  which expires in december and will automatically renew unless either party gives certain notice of non renewal 
the contract provides for the cost of fumed silica to increase approximately over the initial six year term of the fumed silica supply agreement  and in some circumstances is subject to certain inflation adjustments and certain shared cost savings adjustments resulting from our joint efforts 
in addition  since december  we have operated under a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation under which cabot corporation expanded its capacity for the manufacture of fumed alumina and we have the first right to all of this expanded capacity 
the agreement provides that the price cabot corporation charges us for fumed alumina is based on all of its fixed and variable costs for producing the fumed alumina  its capital costs for expanding its capacity  an agreed upon rate of return on investment and incentive payments if they produce more than a certain amount of fumed alumina per year that meets our specifications 
our need for additional quantities or different kinds of key raw materials in the future has required  and will continue to require  that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
future arrangements may result in costs which are different from those in the existing agreements 
we also expect to continue to invest in our operations excellence initiative to improve our manufacturing capabilities to meet our customers increasing product performance requirements 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from increased costs from lower yields associated with meeting customer requirements for higher product quality 
we continue to experience increasing competition and pricing pressure  along with increasing costs to support the higher product quality and advanced technology requirements of our customers 
for these reasons  we expect our gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal to be in the range of  plus or minus 
research and development total research and development expenses were million in  which represented an increase of or million  from research and development expense increased primarily due to million in higher staffing costs  million due to higher depreciation related to the purchase of equipment for our cmp polishing and metrology clean room in aurora  illinois  and million due to higher technical service fees 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in laboratory supplies of million 
research and development efforts were mainly related to formulation and evaluation of new and enhanced cmp slurry products for copper and other applications  commercialization and transfer of new products to our customers and research related to fundamental technology such as advanced chemistry and particle technology 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs of million  increased office expenses of million  higher travel costs of million  increased consulting fees of million and million in separation costs for certain employees 
the higher selling and marketing expenses resulted from our increased customer support initiatives including our transition to selling direct to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia  rather than through a distributor  although we still use a distributor for a relatively small amount of business in japan  we have greatly reduced our percentage of business through this distributor and sell more of our product direct to customers 
increases in selling and marketing expenses also resulted from the transition to a global business team structure to provide a single point of accountability for each major application 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from the increase resulted primarily from million in higher staffing costs  million of increased professional fees  million due to higher insurance premiums and million in separation costs for an employee 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in and other income  net other income was million in  compared to being negligible in the increase in other income is primarily due to higher interest income and lower interest expense  offset by increased foreign exchange losses 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the decreased effect of tax credits from research and experimentation activities 
we expect our income tax rate for fiscal year to be 
net income net income was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
year ended september  versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to a increase in sales volume and million was due to increased weighted average selling prices driven by improved sales mix 
fiscal revenue would have been million lower had the japanese yen average exchange rate for the year held constant with the prior year average 
also  in june  we began selling directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia 
these customers previously had been serviced through metron  a third party distributor 
during this transition period we discontinued sales to metron while they drew down their inventory of our products  which we believe resulted in an adverse revenue impact of million during our third quarter of fiscal cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of or million from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume  million was due to higher average costs per gallon associated with meeting our customers more stringent product quality requirements and million was due to a charge related to the remaining minimum purchase obligation under a raw material supply agreement for a polishing pad technology that was previously under development but is no longer being pursued 
our total cost of this supply agreement was million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in cost of goods sold was partially offset by the absence of royalty payments that ended in august  following the expiration of a contingent payment arrangement with rippey corporation resulting from our acquisition of selected assets used or created in connection with the development and sale of polishing slurries 
we had made payments under this agreement of of applicable slurry revenue from july through our last payment in august gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from an increase in manufacturing costs to support our customers increasing quality requirements  pricing pressure from certain key customers and our recognition of the minimum purchase obligation referred to above 
research and development total research and development expenses were million in  which represented an increase of or million  from research and development expense increased million due to increased staffing  million due to higher wafer purchases and million due to depreciation and operating costs of our aurora  illinois research and development facility and other new equipment 
since our new research and development facility was opened during fiscal  does not represent a full year of depreciation and operating costs related to the facility 
an additional million increase resulted from allocating certain common facility operating costs to research and development 
these costs had previously been treated as general and administrative expense prior to construction of the facility 
additional costs were incurred in technical service support and other areas to support the overall increase in research and development activities 
research and development efforts were mainly related to new and enhanced cmp products  including slurry products for copper applications  new cmp polishing pad technology and advanced chemistry and particle technology 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs associated with our increased customer support initiatives including our transition to selling direct to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia  rather than through a distributor 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from increases include depreciation of our business information systems  higher directors and officers liability insurance premiums of million and increased staffing costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in legal and professional expenses  primarily due to the absence of legal fees associated with the rodel litigation  discussed further below  a decrease in facilities charges due to the change in allocation of certain common facility operating costs described under research and development and the absence of a million non cash charge related to the modification of a former director s stock option agreement in fiscal litigation settlement during the second fiscal quarter of  we settled all pending patent infringement litigation with rodel  which resulted in a one time payment of million 
under the settlement agreement  we received a fully paid up  worldwide royalty free license to all technology that was the subject of the litigation and their foreign equivalents  and there is no further financial obligation with respect to this matter 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in and other income  net other expense was negligible in compared to million of other income in the decrease in other income in is due to the absence of foreign exchange gains recorded in the prior year resulting from the strengthening of the japanese yen  which were partially offset by a payment made to cabot corporation in as reimbursement for certain capital improvements made to equipment used to supply us with raw materials  that is no longer in service 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to an increase in tax credits from expanded research and experimentation activities 
net income net income was million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our revenues and net income for the last three fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in  million in and million in our cash provided by operating activities in originated from net income from operations of million and non cash items of million  which were partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million 
in cash flows used in investing activities were million  of which million was used for purchases of land in geino  japan  production related equipment and research and development equipment 
in addition  we acquired a minority equity ownership interest in nanoproducts corporation in exchange for a million investment of which we have paid approximately million to nanoproducts corporation and intend to pay an additional million 
in cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily due to million in purchases of additional production related equipment  a mm polishing tool and metrology tools to support increased polishing capacity in our class clean room 
these capital expenditures were partially offset by million in cash received from the sale of assets  of which million related to the january sale of our distribution center and land in ansung  south korea 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily due to completion of the construction of our new research and development facility in aurora  illinois  and equipping the facility with additional research and development equipment 
we also purchased additional production related equipment to be used in aurora  illinois and invested in the development and implementation of our business information system 
in cash flows used in financing activities of million resulted primarily from the repurchase of million of common stock and principal payments of million made under capital lease obligations 
these outflows were partially offset by the issuance of common stock of million from the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we had cash flows from financing activities of million in that resulted from the issuance of common stock of million for the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and to a much lesser extent  purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by a million loan repayment  which is described below  and principal payments of million made under capital lease obligations 
we had cash flows from financing activities of million in which resulted from the issuance of common stock of million for both the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  offset partially by principal payments of million made under capital lease obligations 
in july we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
shares are repurchased from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market transactions  at management s discretion 
we fund share repurchases from our existing cash balance 
the plan is primarily intended to diminish earnings dilution from the issuance of stock from the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
the program  which became effective on the announcement date  may be suspended or terminated at any time  at the company s discretion 
in february  we prepaid the entire million unsecured term loan that had been funded on the basis of the illinois state treasurer s economic program which had been due in april and had incurred interest at an annual rate of 
no gain or loss was recognized with respect to the prepayment 
as a result of this prepayment  we have no outstanding long term debt 
in july we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility with a group of commercial banks  and in february and august  this agreement was amended with no material changes in terms 
on november   the then existing agreement was terminated and replaced with an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit facility of million with an option to increase the facility by up to million 
under this agreement  which terminates in november  but can be renewed for two one year terms  interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
a non use fee also accrues 
loans under this facility are anticipated to be used primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility and we believe we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal year will be approximately million  approximately million of which we have already spent as of october  we expect our major capital expenditures in to include the construction of our asia pacific technology center in geino  japan and equipment for new product introductions and product capacity expansions 
we believe that cash generated by our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  expected capital expenditures and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to expand our business and continue to improve our technology and  to do so  we may be required to raise additional funds in the future through public or private equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations less than after total year years years years in millions capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations capital lease obligations since december we have operated under a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation  under which cabot corporation expanded its capacity in tuscola  illinois for the manufacture of fumed alumina 
payments made by us with respect to capital costs for the facility have been treated as a capital lease for accounting purposes and the present value of the minimum quarterly payments of approximately million resulted in a million lease obligation and million related leased asset 
the agreement has an initial five year term  which expires in  but we can choose to renew the agreement for another five year term  which would expire in we also can choose to not renew the agreement subject to certain terms and conditions and the payment of certain costs  after the initial five year term 
in january we entered into a cmp tool and polishing consumables transfer agreement with a third party under which we agreed to transfer polishing consumables to this entity in return for a cmp polishing tool 
the polishing tool has been treated as a capital lease and the aggregate fair market value of the polishing consumables resulted in a million lease obligation 
the term of the agreement is approximately three years 
operating leases we lease certain vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  machinery and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases  most of which expire within ten years and may be renewed by us 
purchase obligations purchase obligations include our take or pay arrangements with suppliers  and purchase orders and other obligations entered into in the normal course of business regarding the purchase of goods and services 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million liability for a raw material supply agreement for a polishing pad technology that was previously under development  but is no longer being pursued 
our remaining obligation with respect to this agreement is million which is recorded in current liabilities and shown in the preceding table under purchase obligations 
in january we entered into a fumed silica supply agreement with cabot corporation  which replaces our original fumed metal oxide agreement with respect to fumed silica  and accordingly amended our fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation with respect to its fumed silica terms such that the agreement now only applies to fumed alumina through its original term of june under the fumed silica supply agreement  we continue to be obligated to purchase at least of our six month volume forecast and to pay for the shortfall if we purchase less than that amount 
this agreement has an initial six year term  which expires in december and will automatically renew unless either party gives certain notice of non renewal 
we currently anticipate meeting minimum forecasted purchase volume requirements 
also  under our fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation we are obligated to pay certain fixed  capital and variable costs through december this agreement has an initial five year term  but we can choose to renew the agreement for another five year term  which would expire in december if we do not renew the agreement  we will become subject to certain terms and conditions and the payment of certain costs 
purchase obligations include million of contractual commitments for fumed silica and fumed alumina under these contracts based upon our anticipated renewal of the fumed alumina agreement through december we have an agreement with a toll manufacturer pursuant to which the manufacturer performs certain agreed upon dispersion services 
we have agreed to purchase minimum amounts of services per year and to invest approximately million per year in capital improvements or other expenditures to maintain capacity at the manufacturer s dispersion facility 
the initial term of the agreement expired in october in november the agreement was renewed for another year under similar terms and conditions 
the contract continues to have automatic one year renewals and contains a day cancellation clause executable by either party 
purchase obligations related to this agreement are million  which include a termination payment if the agreement is not renewed 
in june we entered into a technology licensing and co marketing agreement with a semiconductor equipment manufacturer under which we may develop  manufacture and sell polishing pads utilizing endpoint detection window technology licensed from the manufacturer for use on the manufacturer s equipment 
under this agreement  we are obligated to supply this manufacturer with certain free commercially available polishing pads  up to an agreed upon dollar amount  for particular uses over a seven year period 
the table above includes estimated total costs associated with these products of million over the remaining period 
we are also obligated to supply the equipment manufacturer with certain commercially available polishing pads  up to an agreed upon dollar amount over the seven year period  which the manufacturer will purchase from us at our cost 
we will also pay a royalty to the equipment manufacturer and  in certain circumstances  to another party to whom we are a sub licensee under our agreement  based upon net revenue earned with respect to commercial sales of polishing pads covered under the agreement 
the term of the agreement lasts as long as the patents on the technology subject to the license agreement remain valid and enforceable 
we had been operating under a distribution agreement with an existing supplier of polishing pads to the semiconductor industry pursuant to which the supplier sold pads to us for our resale to end users 
however  due to what we believe was a less than acceptable level of profitability under this value added reseller model  the distribution agreement was terminated by mutual agreement in june pursuant to our june termination agreement  we were obligated to pay a non material transition fee which is included in the table above and was paid in december in july we formed a strategic alliance with nanoproducts corporation under which we acquired a minority equity ownership interest in the company in exchange for a million investment 
under this arrangement  we are collaborating with nanoproducts to develop nanoscale particles for use in future generation cmp slurries  and other fine finish polishing applications 
as of september  we have paid million to nanoproducts and intend to pay an additional million 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities include million for pension liabilities and for deferred compensation obligations 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earning per share eitf issue no 
 which provides guidance on the calculation and disclosure of earnings per share eps  including the use of the two class method for determining eps when a company has participating securities 
we have adopted eitf issue no 
effective september  which had no impact on our fiscal eps 
factors affecting future operating results risks relating to our business we have a narrow product range and our products may become obsolete  or technological changes may reduce or limit increases in cmp consumption our business is substantially dependent on a single class of products  cmp slurries  which historically has accounted for almost all of our revenue 
our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased 
our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the semiconductor industry and to adapt  improve and customize our products for the most advanced ic applications in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends 
since its inception  the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid technological changes and advances in the design  manufacture  performance and application of ic devices  and our customers continually pursue lower cost of ownership of materials consumed in their manufacturing processes  including cmp slurries 
we expect these technological changes and advances  and this drive toward lower costs  to continue in the future 
emerging technologies in the semiconductor industry  such as polishing pads containing abrasives and electrochemical mechanical planarization ecmp  as well as our customers efforts to reduce consumption of cmp slurries  could render our products less important to the ic device manufacturing process 
a significant amount of our business comes from a limited number of large customers and our revenue and profits could decrease significantly if we lost one or more of them as customers our customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers 
one or more of these principal customers may stop buying cmp slurries from us or may substantially reduce the quantity of cmp slurries they purchase from us  as we saw in the third fiscal quarter of with respect to one large customer that notified us of its decision to transition to another supplier of cmp slurries for polishing nanometer copper interconnects 
our principal customers also hold considerable purchasing power  which can impact the pricing  and terms of sale of our products 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in cmp slurries sold to these principal customers  or a significant number of smaller customers  could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal  our five largest customers  of which one is a distributor  accounted for approximately of our revenue  with marketech our distributor in taiwan and china  and intel accounting for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
in fiscal year  our five largest customers  of which two were distributors  accounted for approximately of our revenue  with marketech and intel accounting for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
in june  we completed our transition to selling directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia who previously had been serviced through metron  one of these distributors 
any problem or interruption in supply of our most important raw materials  including fumed metal oxides  could delay our slurry production and adversely affect our sales fumed metal oxides  such as fumed silica and fumed alumina  are significant raw materials we use in many of our cmp slurries 
our business would suffer from any problem or interruption in our supply of fumed metal oxides or other key raw materials 
we operate under three raw material supply agreements with cabot corporation  one of which is for the supply of fumed silica and two of which are for the supply of fumed alumina 
under these agreements  cabot corporation continues to be our primary supplier of particular amounts and types of fumed alumina and fumed silica 
we believe it would be difficult to secure alternative sources of fumed metal oxides in the event cabot corporation or another supplier becomes unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of fumed metal oxides that meet the quality and technical specifications required by our customers 
in addition  contractual amendments to the existing agreements with  or non performance by  cabot corporation or another supplier  could adversely affect us as well 
also  if we change the supplier or type of key raw materials such as fumed metal oxides we use to make our existing cmp slurries or are required to purchase them from a different manufacturer or manufacturing facility  whether cabot corporation or another party  or otherwise modify our products  in certain circumstances our customers might have to requalify our cmp slurries for their manufacturing processes and products 
the requalification process could take a significant amount of time to complete  possibly interrupting or reducing our sales of cmp slurries to these customers 
our business could be seriously harmed if our existing or future competitors develop superior slurry products  offer better pricing terms or service  obtain certain intellectual property rights or if any of our major customers develop or increase in house slurry manufacturing capability competition from current cmp slurry manufacturers  new entrants to the cmp slurry market or a decision by any of our major customers to produce  or increase the production of slurry products in house could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
competition has increased from other existing providers of cmp slurries and opportunities exist for other companies with sufficient financial or technological resources to emerge as potential competitors by developing their own cmp slurry products 
increased competition and additional in house production has and may continue to impact the prices we are able to charge for our slurry products as well as our overall business 
in addition  our competitors could have or obtain intellectual property rights which could restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products 
because we have limited experience in business areas outside of cmp slurries  expansion of our business into new products and applications may not be successful an element of our strategy has been to leverage our current customer relationships and technological expertise to expand our business into new product areas and applications  including cmp polishing pads 
expanding our business into new product areas involves technologies and production processes  in which we have limited experience  and we may not be able to develop and produce products that satisfy our customers needs or we may be unable to keep pace with technological or other developments 
also  our competitors may have or obtain intellectual property rights which could restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products 
we are subject to some risks associated with our foreign operations we currently have operations and a large customer base outside of the united states 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside of the united states 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside of the united states 
we encounter risks in doing business in certain foreign countries  including but not limited to  adverse changes in economic and political conditions  as well as difficulty in enforcing business and customer contracts and agreements  including protection of intellectual property rights 
in june we completed our transition to selling directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia who previously had been serviced through a third party distributor 
selling directly may increase our risk of conducting business in foreign countries 
because we rely heavily on our intellectual property  our failure to adequately obtain or protect it could seriously harm our business protection of intellectual property is particularly important in our industry because cmp slurry and pad manufacturers develop complex technical formulas for cmp products which are proprietary in nature and differentiate their products from those of competitors 
our intellectual property is important to our success and ability to compete 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as employee and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could seriously harm our business 
demand for our products and our business may be adversely affected by worldwide economic and industry conditions our business is affected by current economic and industry conditions and it is extremely difficult to predict sales of our products given uncertainties in these factors 
for example  our quarterly revenue in fiscal years through were affected by the global economic slowdown and weakening in demand for electronic systems  coupled with higher than normal chip inventories 
while the semiconductor industry recovered from this prolonged downturn in fiscal  we believe the outlook for is for moderating revenue growth for the broad semiconductor industry and possibly even a contraction 
further  the semiconductor industry has been cyclical  and the advent of the next downturn could adversely affect our business 
our inability to attract and retain key personnel could cause our business to suffer if we fail to attract and retain the necessary managerial  technical and customer support personnel  our business and our ability to maintain existing and obtain new customers  develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with significant experience in the cmp and ic device industries  is intense 
the loss of services of key employees could harm our business and results of operations 
risks relating to the market for our common stock the market price may fluctuate significantly and rapidly the market price of our common stock has and could continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of factors such as economic and stock market conditions generally and specifically as they may impact participants in the semiconductor industries  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts who follow our stock  earnings and other announcements by  and changes in market evaluations of  us or participants in the semiconductor and related industries  changes in business or regulatory conditions affecting us or participants in the semiconductor and related industries  announcements or implementation by us  our competitors  or our customers of technological innovations  new products or different business strategies  and trading volume of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our rights plan may discourage third parties from making an unsolicited bid for our company our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  our rights plan and various provisions of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company 
for example  our amended certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of blank check preferred stock and to attach special rights and preferences to this preferred stock 
also our amended certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three year terms 
in addition  the rights issued to our stockholders under our rights plan may make it more difficult or expensive for another person or entity to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  the british pound and the euro 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis foreign exchange rate risk we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures
