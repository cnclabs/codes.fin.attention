item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item  description of business cautionary factors that may affect future operating results 
overview general in  we initiated a strategy of focusing on leasing rather than selling our portable storage units 
as a result of this change  leasing revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased steadily from in to in the number of portable storage and combination storage office and mobile office units in our lease fleet increased from  at the end of to  at the end of  representing a compounded annual growth rate  or cagr  of 
because of this shift in strategy  we derive most of our revenues from the leasing of portable storage containers and portable offices 
the average contracted lease term at lease inception is approximately months for portable storage units and approximately months for portable offices 
after the expiration of the contracted lease term  units continue on lease on a month to month basis 
in  the over all lease term averaged months for portable storage units and months for portable offices 
as a result of these long averaged lease terms  our leasing business tends to provide us with a recurring revenue stream and minimizes fluctuations in revenues 
however  there is no assurance that the company will maintain such lengthy overall lease terms 
in addition to our leasing business  we also sell portable storage containers and occasionally we sell portable office units 
since  when we changed our focus to leasing  our sales revenues as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from in to in 
table of contents over the last six years  mobile mini has grown both through internally generated growth and acquisitions which we use to gain a presence in new markets 
typically  we enter a new market through the acquisition of the business of a smaller local competitor and then apply our business model  which is usually much more customer and marketing focused than the business we are buying 
as a result  a new branch location will typically have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as our marketing efforts help us penetrate the new market and we increase the number of units on rent at the new branch  we take advantage of operating efficiencies to improve operating margins at the branch and reach company average levels after several years 
we believe that we incur lower start up costs and a quicker growth curve using this acquisition model than if we were to establish the new location from the ground up  without the acquisition of assets immediately producing lease revenue in the new market 
among the external factors we examine to determine the direction of our business is the level of non residential construction activity  especially in areas of the country where we have a significant presence 
construction activity represents approximately of our units on rent at december   and because of the degree of operating leverage we have  declines in non residential construction activity in and had a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing an infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum staffing levels and certain minimum levels of delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we generate high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit put on lease in excess of the break even level  contributes significantly to profitability 
conversely  additional fixed expenses that we incur require us to achieve additional revenue as compared to the prior period to cover the additional expense 
in  in addition to increased costs associated with branches established in  we experienced material increases in insurance  property taxes and fuel costs 
in that year  we continued to see weakness in the level of leasing revenues from the non residential construction sector of our customer base  resulting in an approximately increase in leasing revenues during compared to this lower than historical growth rate combined with increases in fixed costs depressed our growth in adjusted ebitda as defined below in in managing our business  we focus on our internal growth rate in leasing revenue  which we define as growth in lease revenues on a year over year basis at our branch locations in operation for at least one year  without inclusion of same market acquisitions 
this internal growth rate has remained positive every quarter in and  but has fallen to single digits from over in prior quarters due to the slowdown in the economy  especially as the slowdown has affected the non residential construction sector in areas where we have large branch operations  including texas and colorado 
mobile mini s goal is to increase its internal growth rate so that revenue growth will exceed inflationary growth in expenses and we can again take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on earnings per share  we focus on adjusted ebitda 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which is a measure of our earnings before interest expense  debt restructuring costs  income tax  depreciation and amortization 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into on an irregular basis based on capital needs and market opportunities and provides us with a means to measure internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically ignore the effect of what we consider non recurring events not related to our core business operations to arrive at adjusted ebitda 
the only non recurring events reflected in the adjusted ebitda over the last several years has been the effect in and in of our florida litigation expenses 
the florida litigation is discussed under the caption legal proceedings in part i  item of this report 
in addition  several of the covenants contained under our revolving credit facility are expressed by reference to this financial measure  similarly computed 
because ebitda is a non gaap financial measure as defined by the securities and exchange commission  we include in this report a reconciliation of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this reconciliation is included in item  selected financial data 
in managing our business  we routinely compare our adjusted ebitda margins from year to year and based upon age of branch 
we define this margin as adjusted ebitda divided by our total revenues  expressed as a percentage 
we use this comparison  for example  to study internally the effect that increased costs have on our margins 
as capital is invested in our established locations  we achieve higher adjusted ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch because our fixed costs are already in place 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the startup costs for setting up the facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low adjusted ebitda margins in its early years until the number of units on rent increases 
because of our high operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues 
table of contents sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent significant growth in leasing revenues  the adjusted ebitda margin at a branch will remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis 
accounting and operating overview 
our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage  combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  refurbish and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include among other expenses  advertising and other marketing expenses  commissions and corporate overhead for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our principal asset is our lease fleet  which has historically maintained value close to its original cost 
our lease fleet units other than van trailers were historically depreciated on the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  in most cases years after the date that we put the unit in service  with estimated residual values of on steel units 
effective in  we will depreciate the steel units in our lease fleet using an estimated useful life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of  which effectively results in continual depreciation on these containers at the same annual rate 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data which shows that we have been able to retain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
our wood mobile office units are depreciated over twenty years to of original cost 
van trailers  which constitute a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
see item business product lives and durability 
our branch expansion program and other factors can affect our overall utilization rate 
from through  our annual utilization levels averaged  and ranged from a high of in to a low of in the lower utilization rate in the last few years was primarily a result of i the fact that many of our acquisitions have had utilization levels lower than our historic average rates  especially after we add our proprietary product  ii the fact that it is easier to maintain a higher utilization rate at a large branch and we increased the number of small branches in more recent years  and iii the economic slowdown in the general economy and in particular the slowdown in the construction sector 
we entered six markets in  markets in  and one market in  resulting in reduced overall utilization rates as our system absorbs the added assets 
from the end of through the end of  we grew our lease fleet from  units to  units  representing a cagr of 
our utilization is somewhat seasonal with the low realized in the first quarter and the high realized in the fourth quarter 

table of contents results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of income  certain amounts may not add due to rounding year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses florida litigation expense depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense debt restructuring expense income before provision for income taxes and preferred stock dividend provision for income taxes preferred stock dividend net income available to common stockholders twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing portable storage units and portable offices accounts for the majority of our revenues  and accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average number of units on lease 
in  our internal growth rate was approximately as compared to approximately in we define internal growth as the growth in lease revenues in markets opened for at least one year  excluding any growth arising as a result of additional acquisitions in those markets 
we completed only one small acquisition in portland  oregon in late the slowdown in our internal growth rate in and is principally due to general economic weakness  particularly associated with the non residential construction sector and particularly in several of our more established markets 
internal growth at many of our newer locations was strong 
this growth was offset by weakness at certain of our older more established branches  especially those in texas and colorado  which were affected by weakness in construction in the markets that those branches serve 
sales of portable storage units have accounted for approximately to of our total revenues over the past three years  and we generate less than of our total revenues from other miscellaneous revenues  primarily related to our sales business  principally transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products 
our revenues from the sale of portable storage units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is partially due to increase sales at the locations we added in and a large government sale in the fourth quarter  partially offset by lower sales volume at our more established locations 
cost of sales is the cost to us of units that we sold during the period 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenues  increased to in from in this slight decrease in sales margins is not significant and is partially attributable to lower margins on the government sale made in the fourth quarter  and the sales of van trailers at much lower margins than our principal products 

table of contents leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  was and in and  respectively 
these expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined at older branches  as we were able to benefit from economies of scale as those branches grew 
this was offset by higher leasing  selling and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues at newer branches 
in general  new branches initially have lower operating margins until their fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes that typically are not achieved until the branch has been operated for several years 
among the other major increases in leasing  selling and general expenses in were increases in insurance expense million  advertising expense million  rent expense million which related in significant part to the addition of new locations during the second half of  property tax expense million and fuel expenses incurred in connection with the delivery and pick up of leased containers million 
florida litigation expense relates to litigation and related costs incurred in connection with our florida litigation see item of part i of this report 
we recorded approximately million and million of costs and legal expenses incurred to date in connection with this suit and related litigation in and  respectively 
ebitda in was million  which included the effect of million of florida litigation expense 
in  ebitda was million  which included the effect of million of florida litigation expense 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation was directly related to a larger fleet in  which enabled mobile mini to achieve higher lease revenues  and includes depreciation expenses associated with the refurbishment of portable storage units added to the lease fleet during following our acquisition of the units in transactions that occurred during and prior years and includes the higher depreciation rate associated with wood mobile offices which were a larger part of our fleet in see critical accounting policies and estimates within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of the issuance in june of our senior notes  the proceeds of which were used to replace lower interest secured debt 
our average debt outstanding during  compared to  increased by  with most of the increase occurring during the first six months of  primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to fund the growth of our lease fleet during that period 
the increase in interest expense includes the higher interest cost associated with our senior notes  which effectively increased the weighted average interest rate on our debt from for to for  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in our weighted average interest rate is expected to be higher in due to the full year effect of the higher interest rate on the senior notes 
our senior notes bear interest at per annum  which is higher than the average borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility 
on an annualized basis  the additional interest cost incurred under the senior notes versus the senior secured credit facility is approximately million based on floating rates and swap rates in effect at the time the transaction was concluded 
the issuance of the senior notes provided the company with a great deal of additional liquidity 
see liquidity and capital resources within this item debt restructuring expense was million and includes the termination expenses approximately million related to unwinding certain interest rate swap agreements relating to debt repaid with the proceeds from our sale during june of million of senior notes and the write off of certain capitalized debt issuance costs approximately million associated with our revolving credit agreement before it was amended and restated in june during  we incurred million of expense related to the write off of certain capitalized debt issuance costs associated with a former credit agreement 
the transaction was recorded as an extraordinary item in pursuant to sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which among other things rescinded sfas no 
 the transaction has been reclassified in our consolidated statements in pre tax earnings as debt restructuring expense

we believe  based on internal projections that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets and implement tax planning strategies to reduce the probability of expiring net operating losses 

table of contents net income in was million  which included after tax charges of million related to florida litigation expense and after tax charges of million related to debt restructuring expense

in  our internal growth rate was approximately as compared to approximately in the slowdown in our internal growth rate in was principally due to general economic weakness  particularly associated with the non residential construction customer segment of our business and particularly in our more established markets 
our revenues from the sale of portable storage units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is principally due to sales at our newer branches that were not opened during the entire year and our new branches added through acquisitions in  large sales to a commercial airline that occurred in  and from sales related to culling our fleet of a portion of non core products  principally van trailers

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity summary over the last several years  mobile mini has financed an increasing proportion of its capital needs  most of which are for discretionary needs through working capital and funds generated from operations 
currently  we spend approximately million per year in maintenance capital expenditures to replace forklifts and delivery trucks and trailers that must be replaced 
the remainder of our capital expenditure during any year are discretionary and are used principally to acquire additional units for the lease fleet 
mobile mini s outside sources of liquidity include a million senior secured revolving line of credit  and public equity offerings completed in and in addition  in june  mobile mini issued million of senior notes and amended its million senior secured revolving line of credit 
the effect of this transaction was to increase the company s interest expense  but to replace floating rate debt with fixed rate debt and  through changes in covenants in our senior secured revolving line of credit made possible by the issuance of the senior notes to substantially increase the company s borrowing availability for expansion 
of the million senior secured revolving line of credit  approximately million after the issuance of the senior notes and million was outstanding at december  and  respectively 
as a result of amending the million senior secured revolving line of credit and issuing million senior notes the company s borrowing availability was increased to approximately million 
since  mobile mini has focused the growth of its business on its leasing operations 
leasing is a capital intensive business that requires that we acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets mobile mini leases have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurrent maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital mobile mini has deployed into its leasing business has been of a discretionary nature in order to expand the company s operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at the company s leasing locations  and to add to the mix of products the company offers 
during recent years  mobile mini s operations have generated cash flow that exceeds the company s pre tax earnings  particularly due to the deferral of income taxes due to accelerated depreciation which is used for tax accounting 
historically  mobile mini has funded much of its growth through equity and debt issuances and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
recently  as our operating cash flow has increased and our internal growth rate and rate of external expansion through acquisitions have slowed  mobile mini has been able to fund more of its capital expenditures from operating cash flow  and during mobile mini funded the bulk of its million of capital expenditures with operating cash flow of million 
as a consequence  mobile mini s borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the principal balance of its senior notes did not increase between june  and december   after having increased in the aggregate by million between january  and june  operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in compared to million in and million in the million decrease in over in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to increases in inventory primarily raw materials and supplies  deposits and prepaid expenses primarily advertising costs and lease expenses and accrued liabilities  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable 
the increase in accrued liabilities relates primarily to the florida litigation reserve and the accrual of interest on our senior notes  which is paid semi annually  in january and july 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which minimizes our tax payments at this time 
at december  we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  million of cash was paid for acquisition of businesses compared to million in period and million in capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million for  million for and million in capital expenditures during primarily related to costs of new lease fleet units  which we added at our branches to meet demand  and refurbishment costs associated with bringing containers acquired in prior years up to mobile mini standards 
during the past several years  our fleet has become more customized  enabling us to differentiate our product from our competitors product 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in and million in the higher expenditures in primarily relate to expenditures at our locations acquired during where we made improvements to the yard 
table of contents facilities and purchased the required delivery equipment 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
mobile mini has no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
our maintenance capital expenditures during were approximately million  to cover the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and million in during  mobile mini completed an offering of million of senior notes due and  at the same time  amended its revolving credit facility to revise certain covenants 
the net proceeds of the senior notes offering were used in part to unwind certain interest rate swap agreements approximately million that had been entered into to hedge with floating rate indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility prior to the transaction  and the remainder of the net proceeds was used to repay borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
upon the closing of the transactions  most of mobile mini s outstanding debt was fixed rate debt  and the amount of unused borrowings available to mobile mini under the revolving credit facility increased to approximately million 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  and approximately million of additional borrowings were then available to us under the facility 
during the third quarter of  borrowings under our revolving credit facility measured at daily close of business averaged million and ranged from million to million 
during the fourth quarter of  borrowings under our revolving credit facility measured at daily close of business averaged million and ranged from million to million 
we used million less cash in financing activities during as compared to  primarily as a result of our strategic decision to forego most business acquisition opportunities during in order to focus on growing our existing branch network 
as of march   our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility were approximately million  compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to the semi annual interest payment on the senior notes in january million and the payment of the florida litigation judgment in february million 
the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is based on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  debt restructuring expenses and any judgment settlement costs related to our florida litigation 
the interest rate  effective december   under our credit facility is the libor london interbank offered rate rate plus or the prime rate plus  whichever we elect  subject to certain conditions 
all of our obligations under the revolving credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility and the related guarantees are secured by substantially all of our assets and all assets of each guarantor  including but not limited to i a first priority pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock or other ownership interest owned by us and each guarantor and ii first priority security interests in all of our tangible and intangible assets and the tangible and intangible assets of each guarantor in each case  other than certain equipment assets subject to capitalized lease obligations 
as of december   we had no capital lease obligations 
loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate based  at our option and subject to certain conditions  on either the prime rate plus a spread ranging from nil to depending on our leverage ratio  or the london inter bank offered rate  which we refer to as libor  plus a spread ranging from to depending on our leverage ratio 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly or  which respect to libor borrowings  either quarterly or on the last day of the applicable interest period whichever is more frequent 
in addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal amount  we pay an unused revolving credit facility fee to the senior lenders equal to a range of to per annum on the unused daily balance of the revolving credit commitment  payable monthly in arrears  based upon the actual number of days elapsed in a day year 
for each letter of credit we issue  we pay i a per annum fee equal to the margin over the libor rate from time to time in effect  ii a fronting fee on the aggregate outstanding stated amounts of such letters of credit  plus iii customary administrative charges 
the credit facility documentation contains covenants restricting our ability to  among others i declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  ii prepay  redeem or purchase other debt  iii incur liens  iv make loans and investments  v incur additional indebtedness  vi amend or otherwise alter debt and other material agreements  vii make capital expenditures  viii engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  ix transact with affiliates  and x alter the business we conduct 
we also must comply with specified financial covenants and affirmative covenants 
these financial covenants set maximum values for mobile mini s leverage  fixed charge coverage  capital expenditures  and minimum values for lease fleet utilization rates 
the leverage or debt ratio covenant requires that our ratio of funded debt to ebitda as defined in our revolving credit agreement not exceed a specified ratio  which is to currently and which decreases to to at december  and thereafter 
ebitda for purposes of this covenant i includes our net income plus the amount of any non cash extraordinary losses and debt restructuring costs arising 
table of contents from payments of termination costs of interest rate swaps and from write offs of fees and expenses in connection with the initial funding under the loan and security agreement and ii gives pro forma effect to any permitted acquisition  in each case measured over our fiscal quarters ending on each quarterly measurement date 
our debt ratio covenant excludes all accruals and payments made by us in connection with our florida litigation 
our fixed charge coverage ratio is to and is defined as the ratio of our cash flow for four quarters to the sum of interest expense for such four quarters plus the current portion of our funded debt  but the calculation excludes accruals or cash payments made in connection with our florida litigation 
our capital expenditure covenant limits our permitted payments made in connection with the acquisition of fixed assets to million per year  as adjusted by annual carry forward amounts plus an amount equal to of the net cash proceeds we receive from any issuance of our equity securities 
portable containers held for sale and inventory and equipment acquired in connection with acquisition permitted under our revolving credit agreement are excluded from the capital expenditures covenant limitation 
our lease fleet utilization covenant requires us to maintain minimum utilization ranging from to  depending upon the fiscal quarter that is the measurement period 
the credit facility also contains limitations on  among other things  incurring debt  granting liens  making investments  making restricted payments  entering into transactions with affiliates and prepaying subordinated debt 
our compliance with financial covenants is measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
we were in compliance with all the covenants under the revolving credit facility agreement at december  events of default under the revolving credit facility include  but are not limited to  i our failure to pay principal or interest when due  ii our material breach of any representations or warranty  iii covenant defaults  iv events of bankruptcy  v cross default to certain other debt  vi certain unsatisfied final judgments over a stated threshold amount  and vii a change of control 
prior to june  we entered into interest rate swap agreements under which we effectively fixed the interest rate payable on million of borrowings under our credit facility so that the rate is based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
in june  in conjunction with our sale of our senior notes and the amendment of our credit facility  we terminated million of these swap agreements 
accounting for these swap agreements is covered by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 and pursuant to sfas no 
 the swap termination resulted in a charge to net income of approximately million  net of an income tax benefit of approximately million at june  at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included million  net of applicable income tax benefit of million  related to our interest rate swap agreements 
at december   all of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates or the rate is effectively fixed due to a swap agreement  other than approximately million of borrowings under our credit facility 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily provided by our credit facility  which we used to expand our lease fleet and finance our branch expansion  including acquisitions of new branches during in  cash provided by financing activities was primarily provided by our sale of approximately million shares of common stock in march  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
those proceeds were used to temporarily pay down our borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
mobile mini believes that it has sufficient borrowings available under the facility to provide for its foreseeable capital needs over the next to months  with the duration dependent in large part upon the balance between the internal growth rates achieved during and subsequent periods and the expenses of entry into additional markets during the period  which will be the main determinant of how quickly the company uses its additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under our secured revolving credit facility and million of unsecured senior notes  together with other notes payable obligations both secured and unsecured 
we also have operating lease commitments for real estate properties for the majority of our branches with remaining lease terms on our major leased properties ranging from to years  delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price  and other equipment  primarily office machines 
we currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventory for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
this causes lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the year 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgements our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
mobile mini s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage units and office units are recognized monthly  which approximates a straight line basis 
revenues and expenses from portable storage unit delivery and hauling are recognized when these services are billed  in accordance with sab  as amended by sab  as these services are considered inconsequential to the overall leasing transaction 
we recognize revenues from sales of containers upon delivery 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts agings 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a 
table of contents regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share at december  as follows years ended december  as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for hypothetical change in reserve estimates net income diluted earnings per share 
table of contents if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
when we determine the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  we tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we performed the annual required impairment tests for goodwill at december  and december  and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired as of those dates 
we will perform this test in the future as required by sfas impairment long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  in most cases years after the date we put the unit in service  with estimated residual values of on steel units and on wood office units 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the larger competitors in our industry  profit margins we are achieving on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
effective in  our depreciation policy on our lease fleet steel units will be changed to an estimated useful life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of which effectively results in continual depreciation on these containers at the same annual rate 
this change is being made to reflect that some of the units in our fleet are now more than years old measured by first date of service in our fleet and we have not experienced any decline in these units fair rental or sales values 
any change to our depreciation policy on our steel units  from the residual value and a year life to a lower residual and a longer useful life  could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with the actual effect being determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life on our steel units would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share at december  as reflected in the table below 
useful residual life in value years as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income 
table of contents useful residual life in value years diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance is purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we expense the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims review by our staff and our insurance companies  and  at year end  the accrual is reviewed and adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can determine that it is probable as that term is defined in sfas that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged
