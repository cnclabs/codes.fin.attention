item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements as a result of factors  including those discussed previously  under risk factors or in other parts of this annual report on form k 
corporate history somera communications  inc was formed in august and is incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware 
in november  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from our initial public offering 
since that time  our common stock has traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol smra 
business combinations 
in october  we acquired msi communications inc msi 
this acquisition has enabled us to strengthen our product offering in data networking equipment and services  increase our national presence  and provide key personnel 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
we paid million in cash  including acquisition costs  and issued  shares of our common stock 
in october  we completed the acquisition of the equipment repair business of asurent technologies  inc asurent for million in cash  including acquisition costs 
the acquisition of asurent provides us with enhanced equipment repair capabilities  key personnel  and additional customer and supplier relationships 
in october  we acquired compass telecom  llc compass telecom to strengthen our services offerings  provide key personnel  and contribute additional customer relationships 
through this acquisition  somera developed or strengthened services offerings in the areas of equipment deployment services for installation  de installation and microwave deployment  as well as site development  network development  and e services 
we paid million in cash  including acquisition costs and another million in as a result of earn out obligations 
in addition  under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we were obligated to pay up to million in cash over the next three years as a result of a contingent earn out that was based on achieving future performance targets 
in november  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with two of the former owners of compass telecom  where we agreed to sell back to these former owners those service products that did not support or complement our equipment business  including site development  network development  and e services 
in consideration of the transfer of assets  we received  on february  for certain expenses incurred by somera on behalf of compass and are due to receive of gross revenues of the newly formed entity through under the terms of the agreement  the former owners of compass have relinquished their rights to receive all remaining earn out payments referred to above under their prior agreement with somera 
the financial results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition 
for further details about these acquisitions  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared to equipment revenue 
substantially all of our equipment revenue consists of sales of new and re used telecommunications equipment  including switching  transmission  wireless  data  microwave and power 
table of contents products  net of estimated provision for returns 
equipment revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in equipment revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in new equipment sales  in conjunction with a decrease in re used equipment sales 
equipment revenue from customers in the united states decreased to million from million  primarily due to reduced new equipment sales 
currently  all revenue from customers outside of the united states consists of equipment sales 
net revenue from customers outside of the united states increased to million in from million in due to the expansion of our international operations  primarily in europe 
our expansion in europe was partially offset by decreases in our asiapacific and latin america regions 
we continue to focus on international growth  particularly in europe 
equipment revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in new equipment net revenue was impacted significantly by oem actions in to aggressively discount their current generation products and or extend their terms to customers  to reduce their inventories and to meet their quarterly financial sales expectations 
the result of these actions was to make it more feasible for operators  our customers  to purchase new equipment directly from the oem  rather than purchasing from us 
additionally  another factor which has caused the decline in new equipment revenues is the impact of our microwave equipment  which is our largest new equipment product category 
the equipment we sell in this category is reaching the end of its lifecycle 
finally  as a result of the financial distress in the telecommunications industry  customer purchasing behavior has changed  which has reduced customers demand for new equipment  thus contributing to the decline in new equipment sales in equipment revenue attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in equipment revenue attributable to re used equipment sales was primarily due to two events 
the primary reason for the decline was oems aggressively discounted current generation products to reduce inventories to meet quarterly expectations  which  in turn  put downward pricing pressure on re used equipment 
further  oems engaged in aggressive programs to counter the secondary market through right to use licenses and enforcement of existing volume purchase agreements with telecommunications operators 
in addition  our sourcing activity throughout was less aggressive than in previous years 
as we re organized purchasing responsibilities and guidelines to reflect market conditions  there was a period where we were conservative and did not source enough product to fulfill demand 
we have undertaken actions to rebuild and re organize supply and believe our purchasing behavior is now consistent with previous years 
service revenue 
service revenue for the year ended december  was primarily derived from deployment ie  installation de installation  microwave support and maintenance ie repair contracts 
service revenue decreased to million in from million in service revenues declined primarily due to customers postponement of network build outs due to their budget constraints 
equipment cost of revenue 
substantially all of our equipment cost of revenue consists of the costs of equipment we purchase from third party sources  related in bound and out bound freight costs  and associated external handling costs 
equipment cost of revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in equipment cost of revenue during this period is primarily attributable to decreases in our equipment volumes with respect to new equipment sales 
equipment cost of revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased to million in from million in equipment cost of revenue attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in re used equipment cost of revenue is proportionate to the decline in re used equipment net revenue 
service cost of revenue 
service cost of revenue primarily consists of time and materials of our project managers and invoices for services outsourced to third party entities 
service cost of revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service cost of revenue is primarily attributable to increased costs of providing services due to our acquisition of compass telecom 
prior to the compass telecom acquisition  virtually all of our services were outsourced to third party vendors and the cost of 
table of contents services was primarily third party vendor costs 
with the acquisition of compass telecom  our service product offering increased and many contracts were completed with internal resources or with a combination of internal resources and outside vendors 
these additional service offerings in conjunction with repair revenues  of which most are outsourced at low margins  was the primary reason for the increase in service cost of revenues 
equipment gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of equipment revenue remained fairly consistent year over year at in compared to in although we experienced a decrease in re used equipment margins  the decrease was offset by a change in the mix of new and re used equipment as our sales of new equipment  which have lower margins  decreased significantly year over year 
gross margin attributable to new equipment sales remained fairly consistent year over year at in compared to in gross margin attributable to re used equipment sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin attributable to re used equipment sales was due primarily to insufficient inventory management controls 
we believe that effective and appropriate inventory management controls have been put in place to ensure ongoing proper inventory management 
service gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of service revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gross profit on service revenue was primarily attributable to the decrease in service revenue and a shift in the mix between higher margin service products  such as various deployment services to lower margin service products  such as repair specific maintenance services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits for sales  marketing and procurement employees as well as costs associated with advertising and promotions 
a majority of our sales and marketing expenses are incurred in connection with establishing and maintaining long term relationships with a variety of operators 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million to million or of net revenue in compared to million or of net revenue in the primary decrease in sales and marketing is due to commissions  which decreased approximately million due to a decrease in gross margin 
in addition  salaries expense decreased million from due to a decline in sales headcount of during this decrease was offset by severance expense of approximately  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees and facility costs including distribution and technical operations 
general and administrative expenses remained constant year over year at million  or of net revenue  in compared to which was million  or of net revenue 
the slight increase in general and administrative expenses from to included a decrease of million in salary expense due to reduced general and administrative headcount of during  and depreciation expense  which decreased million 
these decreases in general and administrative expenses were offset by increases in consulting expense of million due to sarbanes oxley compliance and a tax consulting project  increases in health and workers compensation insurance of  and increases in accounting expenses of  restructuring charges and asset impairment 
during the second quarter of  we completed our annual impairment review of goodwill as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this analysis considered the estimated fair value of our three reporting units new equipment  re used equipment  and services based on market capitalization  as implied by the value of our common stock and estimated discounted future cash flows 
we determined that the carrying values of two reporting units services and re used equipment exceeded their respective fair values 
accordingly  we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with their carrying values and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we also completed an impairment review of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on this review  we determined that certain intangible assets could not be recovered from their undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  in the second quarter we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of approximately  to write down these assets to their estimated fair values 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we announced and began implementation of our operational restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and streamline our operating facilities 
continuing lease obligations primarily relate to closure of the oxnard  california  norcross  georgia  and euless  texas facilities

at december   we remain obligated under lease obligations of  associated with our december operational restructuring 
the lease obligations expire in termination benefits are comprised of severance related payments for all employees to be terminated in connection with the operational restructuring 
termination benefits do not include any amounts for employment related services prior to termination

other income  net  consists of investment earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances  realized gains losses on disposals of assets and realized foreign currency gains losses 
other income  net  decreased to  in from million in the decrease in other income was primarily due to a loss on disposal of assets 
in conjunction with the asset purchase agreement entered into with the former owners of compass telecom  we transferred certain assets at zero cost to the owners and accordingly recorded a loss on disposal of  in addition  we saw a slight decrease in interest income during the year due to a lower cash balance in effect during we had no long term debt outstanding as of december  income tax benefit provision 
in  we had an income tax provision of million  with an effective tax rate of 
our provision for taxes included a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
under generally accepted accounting principals  we must establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recovered 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  both positive and negative evidence must be considered 
it was determined that our cumulative losses reported in and represented significant negative evidence which required a full valuation allowance to be recorded 
compared to equipment revenue 
equipment revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in equipment revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in new equipment sales as well as a decrease in re used equipment sales 
equipment revenues from customers in the united states decreased to million from million  primarily due to reduced new equipment sales

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  warranty reserves  sales return reserves  valuation allowances  and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets to be critical policies 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from the sale of new and re used telecommunications equipment and equipment related services 
with the exception of equipment exchange transactions  whereby equipment from one operator s network is taken in exchange for other equipment  equipment revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that at the time of delivery  there is evidence of a contractual arrangement with the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no significant remaining obligations 
delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  generally at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we also generate service revenue  either in connection with equipment sales or through service only transactions 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as services are rendered at contract labor rates plus material and other direct costs incurred 
revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
estimates of costs to complete include material  direct labor  overhead  and allowable general and administrative expenses 
these estimates are reviewed on a contract by contract basis  and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision 
the full amount of an estimated loss is charged to operations in the period it is determined that a loss will be realized from the contract 
revenue earned but not yet billed is reflected as unbilled receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
unbilled receivables were  and  at december  and  respectively 
there were no unbilled receivables for the year ended december  revenue from services represented approximately   and of total revenue for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
revenue for transactions that include multiple elements such as equipment and services bundled together is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value or in the absence of fair value  the residual method and recognized when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the following criteria are satisfied undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of delivered elements  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  and the fair value for all undelivered elements is known 
revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is uncertain  when significant obligations remain  or when undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
we manage contracts whereby we pay for services rendered by third parties acting as agents for our customers 
we pass these expenses through to customers  who reimburse us for the expenses plus a management fee 
revenues related to these types of contracts are from management fees received from customers 
we supply equipment to companies in exchange for new or re used equipment or to companies from which re used equipment was purchased under separate arrangements executed within a short period of time reciprocal arrangements 
for reciprocal arrangements  the company considers accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 nonmonetary transactions magnitude of boot and exceptions to the use of fair value  and interpretation of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
revenue is recognized when the equipment received in accordance with the reciprocal arrangement is sold through to a third party 
revenues recognized under reciprocal arrangements were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
warranty reserve 
we generally accrue for estimated future warranty expenses for equipment sales upon product delivery  and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the equipment warranties generally carry a one year warranty from the date of shipment 

table of contents accordingly  our estimated warranty expenses are determined based on historical information such as past experience  product failure rates or number of units repaired  estimated cost of material and labor per claim  and in certain instances  estimated property damage 
the warranty reserve is expensed to cost of goods sold and is included in other accrued liabilities 
actual claims incurred in the future may differ from original estimates  which may result in material revisions to the warranty reserves 
at december   the reserve for warranty obligations was  sales returns reserve 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on our historical return rate 
the returns reserve is recorded against revenue and is included in accounts receivable 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could affect our operating results 
at december  the reserve for sales returns was  valuation allowances 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  we make estimates of doubtful accounts in accounts receivable  slow moving and obsolete inventory  and realizability of deferred tax assets 
these estimates are made based on a consideration of various factors  including historical experience  knowledge of customers and the telecommunications equipment market  and current economic trends 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could affect our operating results 
at december   the estimate for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million 
our inventory reserve methodology consists of reserving all inventory greater than days 
in addition  we review all inventory between and for sales history or activity 
items between and days which do not have sales history or activity in the last six months are reviewed to determine if a partial or full impairment is required 
during the year ended december  we recorded an million increase to the inventory reserve  resulting from continued weakness in the telecommunications industry and changes in our business strategy  as well as our past purchase of used equipment for which demand did not materialize 
as of december   net inventory was lower than as of december  reserves were million on million of gross inventory at december  versus million in reserves on million in inventory at december  the decrease in inventory was because in january of  we wrote off and scrapped million of inventory  all of which was reserved as of december  in addition  during the first two quarters of  the company consolidated all domestic inventory held in distribution centers located in the states of new jersey  georgia and california to a single  centrally located facility in texas 
this consolidation of distribution centers resulted in a million provision in inventory reserve due to lost  stolen  and damaged inventory 
at december   the estimate for doubtful accounts was  we review our accounts receivable detail and specifically identify any customers for which indicators of impairment exist and record a specific doubtful accounts reserve for these balances 
additionally  we estimate a general reserve for bad debts based on historical writeoffs as a percentage of sales 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on management estimates and assumptions 
generally accepted accounting principles requires that we establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recovered 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence to support the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
we determined that our cumulative recurring losses reported in and represented significant negative evidence  which indicated the need for a full valuation allowance to be recorded 
as such  we took a charge of million to write off our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of we will record valuation allowances against any future deferred tax assets resulting from tax benefits for future losses 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets  as determined by underlying contract terms or appraisals 
such lives range from one to three years 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we accounted for the acquisition of the assets of compass telecom llc  completed after july   under the new guidance  and on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from the msi communications  inc and asurent technologies  inc 
acquisitions  which were completed prior to july  we were required to perform a transitional impairment review of our goodwill prior to june  and an impairment review at least annually thereafter 
in june  we completed our annual goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment tests outlined under sfas no 
 which required the assessment of goodwill and purchased intangibles for impairment as of june  these tests were conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas no 
 to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets for two of our three reporting units were impaired as of june  and a million write down to goodwill was taken 
based on the impairment of goodwill  we then performed a sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  impairment test on the purchased intangible assets and determined they were impaired as of june  subsequently  we completed a write down to the purchased intangible assets of  the goodwill balances at december  and were million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  addressing how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of the statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows as of and for the year ended december

table of contents risk factors certain factors that may affect future operating results you should carefully consider the risks described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate in future periods  which might lead to reduced prices for our stock 
our annual or quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if our annual or quarterly operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our stock could significantly decline 
factors that could impact our operating results include the rate  timing and volume of orders for the telecommunications infrastructure equipment we sell  the rate at which telecommunications operators de install their equipment  decreases in our selling prices due to competition in the secondary market or price pressure from oems  our ability to obtain products cost effectively from oems  distributors  operators and other secondary sources of telecommunications equipment  our ability to provide equipment and service offerings on a timely basis to satisfy customer demand  variations in customer capital spending patterns due to seasonality  economic conditions for telecommunications operators and other factors  write offs due to inventory defects or obsolescence  the sales cycle for equipment we sell  which can be relatively lengthy  delays in the commencement of our operations in new market segments and geographic regions  and costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of new businesses 
our business depends upon our ability to match third party re used equipment supply with telecommunications operators demand for this equipment and failure to do so could reduce our net revenue 
our success depends on our continued ability to match the equipment needs of telecommunications operators with the supply of re used equipment available in the secondary market 
we depend upon maintaining business relationships with third parties who can provide us with re used equipment and information on available re used equipment 
failure to effectively manage these relationships and match the needs of our customers with available supply of re used equipment could damage our ability to generate net revenue 
in the event operators decrease the rate at which they de install their networks  or choose not to de install their networks at all  it would be more difficult for us to locate this equipment  which could negatively impact our net revenue 
a continued downturn in the telecommunications industry or an industry trend toward reducing or delaying additional equipment purchases due to cost cutting pressures could reduce demand for our products 
we rely significantly upon customers concentrated in the telecommunications industry as a source of net revenue and re used equipment inventory 
in and continuing through  we experienced a general 
table of contents downturn in the level of capital spending by our telecommunications customers 
this slow down in capital spending could result in postponement of network upgrades and reduced sales to our customers 
there can be no assurance that the level of capital spending in the telecommunications industry or by our customers specifically will increase or remain at current levels  or generate future net revenue levels at which our business would be profitable in future periods 
the market for supplying equipment to telecommunications operators is competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our net revenue and gross margins might decline 
competition among companies who supply equipment to telecommunications operators is intense 
we currently face competition primarily from three sources oems  distributors and secondary market dealers who sell new and re used telecommunications infrastructure equipment 
if we are unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors  we may have to lower our selling prices and may experience reduced gross margins and loss of market share  either of which could harm our business 
competition is likely to increase as new companies enter this market  as current competitors expand their products and services or as our competitors consolidate 
increased competition in the secondary market for telecommunications equipment could also heighten demand for the limited supply of re used equipment  which would lead to increased prices for  and reduce the availability of  this equipment 
any increase in these prices could significantly impact our ability to maintain our gross margins 
we do not have many formal relationships with suppliers of telecommunications equipment and may not have access to adequate product supply 
in fiscal year  of our net revenue was generated from the sale of re used telecommunications equipment 
typically  we do not have supply contracts to obtain this equipment and are dependent on the de installation of equipment by operators to provide us with much of the equipment we sell 
our ability to buy re used equipment from operators is dependent on our relationships with them 
if we fail to develop and maintain these business relationships with operators or they are unwilling to sell re used equipment to us  our ability to sell re used equipment will suffer 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
historically  a significant portion of our sales has been to relatively few customers 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in  and of our net revenue in no single customer accounted for at least of our net revenue in verizon communications accounted for and of our net revenue in and  respectively 
in addition  substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and we do not have long term purchasing agreements with customers 
we face a further risk that consolidation among our significant customers  such as the recently announced acquisition proposals made involving at t wireless  could result in more customer concentration and fewer sales opportunities that would adversely impact our net revenue 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to purchase from us 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
we may be forced to reduce the sales prices for the equipment we sell  which may impair our ability to maintain our gross margins 
in the future we expect to reduce prices in response to competition and to generate increased sales volume 
in some manufacturers reduced their prices of new telecommunications equipment 
if manufacturers reduce the prices of new telecommunications equipment  we may be required to further reduce the price of the new and re used equipment we sell 
if we are forced to reduce our prices or are unable to shift the sales mix towards higher margin equipment sales  we will not be able to maintain current gross margins 

table of contents the market for re used telecommunications equipment is relatively new and it is unclear whether our equipment and service offerings and our business will achieve long term market acceptance 
the market for re used telecommunications equipment is relatively new and evolving  and we are not certain that our potential customers will adopt and deploy re used telecommunications equipment in their networks 
for example  with respect to re used equipment that includes a significant software component  potential customers may be unable to obtain a license or sublicense for the software 
even if they do purchase re used equipment  our potential customers may not choose to purchase re used equipment from us for a variety of reasons 
our customers may also re deploy their displaced equipment within their own networks  which would eliminate their need for our equipment and service offerings 
these internal solutions would also limit the supply of re used equipment available for us to purchase  which would limit the development of this market 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and sales personnel  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees 
the loss of key members of our senior management or other key employees could negatively impact our operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy 
for example  we recently announced management changes whereby our former president and chief executive officer  rick darnaby  left our company  and our chief financial officer  steve cordial  had his role at somera expanded so that he now serves also as our acting president and chief executive officer while an executive search is ongoing for a new chief executive officer 
in addition  we depend on our sales professionals to serve customers in each of our markets 
the loss of key sales professionals could significantly disrupt our relationships with our customers 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in the telecommunications equipment industry is intense 
additionally  we depend on our ability to train and develop skilled sales people and an inability to do so would significantly harm our growth prospects and operating performance 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing market 
the market for the equipment and services we sell is characterized by technological changes  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and frequent new equipment and service introductions 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend  in part  on our ability to timely and cost effectively respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  develop our internal technical capabilities and expertise  broaden our equipment and service offerings  and adapt our services to new technologies as they emerge 
our failure in any of these areas could harm our business 
moreover  any increased emphasis on software solutions as opposed to equipment solutions could limit the availability of re used equipment  decrease customer demand for the equipment we sell  or cause the equipment we sell to become obsolete 
the lifecycles of telecommunications infrastructure equipment may become shorter  which would decrease the supply of  and carrier demand for  re used equipment 
our sales of re used equipment depend upon telecommunications operator utilization of existing telecommunications network technology 
if the lifecycle of equipment comprising operator networks is significantly shortened for any reason  including technology advancements  the installed base of any particular model would be limited 
this limited installed base would reduce the supply of  and demand for  re used equipment  which could decrease our net revenue 

table of contents many of our customers are telecommunications operators that may at any time reduce or discontinue their purchases of the equipment we sell to them 
if our customers choose to defer or curtail their capital spending programs  it could have a negative impact on our sales to those telecommunications operators  which would harm our business 
a significant portion of our customers are emerging telecommunications operators who compete against existing telecommunications companies 
these new participants only recently began to enter these markets  and many of these operators are still building their networks and rolling out their services 
they require substantial capital for the development  construction and expansion of their networks and the introduction of their services 
if emerging operators fail to acquire and retain customers or are unsuccessful in raising needed funds or responding to any other trends  such as price reductions for their services or diminished demand for telecommunications services in general  then they could be forced to reduce their capital spending programs 
if we fail to implement our strategy of purchasing equipment from and selling equipment to regional bell operating companies  our growth will suffer 
one of our strategies is to develop and expand our relationships with regional bell operating companies  or rbocs 
we believe the rbocs could provide us with a significant source of additional net revenue 
in addition  we believe the rbocs could provide us with a large supply of re used equipment 
we cannot assure you that the implementation of this strategy will be successful 
rbocs may not choose to sell re used equipment to us or may not elect to purchase this equipment from us 
rbocs may instead develop those capabilities internally or elect to compete with us and resell re used equipment to our customers or prospective customers 
if we fail to successfully develop our relationships with rbocs or if rbocs elect to compete with us  our growth could suffer 
if we do not continue to expand our international operations our growth could suffer 
we intend to continue expanding our business in international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop a successful international business  including sales  procurement and support channels 
following this strategy  we opened our european headquarters in the fourth quarter of  and in established sales offices in brazil  sweden and russia 
however  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the equipment we sell  and therefore we might not be able to expand our international operations 
our experience in providing equipment outside the united states is increasing  but still developing 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for million  or  of our net revenue in  million  or  of our net revenue in  and million  or  of our net revenue in if we do engage in selective acquisitions  we may experience difficulty assimilating the operations or personnel of the acquired companies  which could threaten our future growth 
if we make acquisitions in the future  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel or integrating their operations  equipment or services into our organization 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs  impairment of goodwill  or amortization of acquired other intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
defects in the equipment we sell may seriously harm our credibility and our business 
telecommunications operators require a strict level of quality and reliability from telecommunications equipment suppliers 
telecommunications equipment is inherently complex and can contain undetected software or hardware errors 
if we deliver telecommunications equipment with undetected material defects  our reputation  
table of contents credibility and equipment sales could suffer 
moreover  because the equipment we sell is integrated into our customers networks  it can be difficult to identify the source of a problem should one occur 
the occurrence of such defects  errors or failures could also result in delays in installation  product returns  product liability and warranty claims and other losses to us or our customers 
in some of our contracts  we have agreed to indemnify our customers against liabilities arising from defects in the equipment we sell to them 
furthermore  we supply most of our customers with warranties that cover the equipment we offer 
while we may carry insurance policies covering these possible liabilities  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim  whether successful or not  could be costly  damage our reputation and distract key personnel  any of which could harm our business 
our strategy to outsource services could impair our ability to deliver our equipment on a timely basis 
while we have expanded our services capability  we still currently depend on  to a large degree  third parties for a variety of equipment related services  including engineering  repair  transportation  testing  installation and de installation 
this outsourcing strategy involves risks to our business  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality and costs and the potential absence of adequate capacity 
in the event that any significant subcontractor was to become unable or unwilling to continue to perform their required services  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
this process could be lengthy  and we cannot be sure that additional sources of third party services would be available to us on a timely basis  or at all 
our quarterly net revenue and the price of our stock may be negatively impacted by the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers 
our quarterly net revenue may be subject to the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  which may occur as a result of our customers annual budgetary  procurement and sales cycles 
if our quarterly net revenue fails to meet the expectations of analysts due to those seasonal fluctuations  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
our ability to meet customer demand and the growth of our net revenue could be harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory needs accurately 
to meet customer demand in the future  we believe it is necessary to maintain or increase some levels of inventory 
failure to maintain adequate inventory levels in these products could hurt our ability to make sales to our customers 
in the past  we have experienced inventory shortfalls on certain high demand equipment  and we cannot be certain that we will not experience such shortfalls again in the future  which could harm our ability to meet customer demand 
further  rapid technology advancement could make portions of our existing inventory obsolete and cause us to incur losses 
in addition  if our forecasts lead to an accumulation of inventories that are not sold in a timely manner  our business could suffer 
the corruption or interruption of key software systems we use could cause our business to suffer if it delays or restricts our ability to meet our customers needs 
we rely on the integrity of key software and systems 
specifically we rely on our relationship management database which tracks information on currently or potentially available re used equipment 
this software and these systems may be vulnerable to harmful applications  computer viruses and other forms of corruption and interruption 
in the event any form of corruption or interruption affects our software or systems  it could delay or restrict our ability to meet our customers needs  which could harm our reputation or business 

table of contents if we are unable to meet our additional capital needs in the future  we may not be able to execute our business growth strategy 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy these requirements 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to take advantage of business opportunities  including more rapid international expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses  develop and maintain higher inventory levels  gain access to new product lines  develop new services  or respond to competitive pressures 
any additional financing we may need might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our business could suffer if the inability to raise this funding threatens our ability to execute our business growth strategy 
moreover  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced 
newly issued equity securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of investors in our common stock 
in addition  the terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we face the risk of future non recurring charges in the event of impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning in january and  as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill 
however  we will continue to have amortization related to other purchased intangibles  and we must evaluate our intangible assets  including goodwill  at least annually for impairment 
in  our amortization charge for other intangibles was  in june  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined our goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we took an impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the future realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we determined that our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income was uncertain 
as such  we took a charge of million to write off all of our short and long term deferred tax assets 
our facilities could be vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our main facilities are located on or near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
if a disaster occurs  our ability to test and ship the equipment we sell would be seriously  if not completely  impaired  and our inventory could be damaged or destroyed  which would seriously harm our business 
we cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions will be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us  and may make future business decisions with which some of our stockholders might disagree 
our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control
