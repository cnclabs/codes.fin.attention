competition  changes in broadcasting industry the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive 
the success of each of our stations depends largely upon its audience ratings and its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenue directly with other radio stations within their respective markets 
radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group 
by building a strong listener base consisting of a specific demographic group in each of our markets  we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners 
the following are some of the factors that are important to a radio station s competitive position management talent and expertise  audience ratings  sales talent and expertise  signal strength  and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
in addition  we attempt to improve our competitive position with promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups targeted by our stations and by sales efforts designed to attract advertisers 
radio station operators are subject to the possibility of another station changing programming formats to compete directly for listeners and advertisers or launching an aggressive promotional campaign in support of an already existing competitive format 
if a competitor  particularly one with substantial financial resources  were to attempt to compete in either of these fashions  the broadcast cash flow of our affected station could decrease due to increased promotional and other expenses and or lower advertising revenues 
there can be no assurance that any one of our radio stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience ratings and radio advertising revenue market share 
the operation of a radio broadcast station requires a license from the federal communications commission or fcc 
the number of radio stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the number of am and fm frequencies allotted by the fcc to communities in that market 
the fcc s multiple ownership rules further limit the number of stations serving the same area that may be owned or controlled by a single entity 
the fcc adopted on june  new ownership rules to modify the local radio market definition by reference  where available  to the geographic markets as defined by arbitron  implementation of the new rules  however  has been stayed pending the decision of the us court of appeals for the third circuit reviewing challenges to such rules  and the existing rules defining radio markets based on certain overlapping signal contours remain in effect 
the radio caps remain unchanged under both versions of the rules 
if the pending rules are allowed to go into effect  the market clusters in kansas city and wilkes barre scranton would not comply with the applicable numeric limitations  although they do comply with those limitations under the existing rules 
the pending rules provide  however  that clusters that complied with the numeric limitations under the existing rules but exceed those limitations as determined under the new market definition of the pending rules  will be grandfathered  provided that these clusters could not be transferred intact to a new licensee unless it qualified under specified standards as a small business 
in addition  proposals have been introduced in congress that  if adopted into law  may result in still different ownership rules affecting the number of stations that may be owned in a common geographic area and whether existing combinations would be considered as grandfathered 
our stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media such as newspapers  magazines  over the air and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail 
the radio broadcasting industry also competes with new media technologies that are being developed or introduced  such as satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which now has two primarily subscriber based services that offer numerous formats with cd type sound quality  audio programming offered by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers  personal communications services and other wireless digital audio delivery services  and low power fm radio  which has resulted in new noncommercial fm stations serving small  localized areas 
the radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information  such as television broadcasting  cable television  audio tapes and compact discs 
there can be no assurances  however  that this historical growth will continue or that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry 
the fcc also has a pending proceeding which contemplates the use of digital technology by existing am and fm radio broadcast stations to both improve sound quality and provide spectrum for enhanced data services to complement the existing programming service and provide new business opportunities for radio broadcasters 
the fcc has authorized use of an in band on channel  or iboc  digital technology developed by ibiquity digital corporation on fm stations full time and on am stations day time only 
we have invested in ibiquity and have tested and installed the iboc digital technology on certain of our stations 
we cannot predict what other new competitive services or other regulatory matters might be considered in the future by the fcc  nor can we assess in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these services  proposals or changes might have on our business 
federal regulation of radio broadcasting the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation of  among other things  ownership limitations  program content  advertising content  technical operations and business and employment practices 
the ownership  operation and sale of radio stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for broadcasting  determines the particular frequencies  locations  operating power  and other technical parameters of stations  issues  renews  revokes and modifies station licenses  determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  and adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly affect the ownership  operation and employment practices of stations 
the fcc has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the communications act of the communications act  including the imposition of monetary fines  the issuance of short term licenses  the imposition of a condition on the renewal of a license  the denial of authority to acquire new stations  and the revocation of operating authority 
the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and of certain specific fcc regulations and policies 
this summary is not a comprehensive listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations 
for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations  you should refer to the communications act  fcc rules and fcc public notices and rulings 
fcc licenses 
radio stations operate pursuant to renewable broadcasting licenses that are ordinarily granted by the fcc for maximum terms of eight years 
the fcc licenses for our stations are held by our subsidiaries 
a station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending 
during the periods when renewal applications are pending  petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties  including members of the public  on a variety of grounds 
the fcc is required to renew a broadcast station license if the fcc finds that the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or the fcc s rules and regulations  and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or the fcc s rules and regulations that  taken together  constitute a pattern of abuse 
the fcc has initiated enforcement proceedings alleging that several of our radio stations have broadcast indecent programming in violation of the fcc s rules 
we have defended our operations and denied that the allegations made have merit 
in recent decisions with respect to similar allegations against other station licensees  the fcc has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings for serious future indecency violations 
the pendency of these proceedings  as well as the fcc s more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry as a whole  may encourage third parties to challenge our license renewal applications or applications to acquire new stations 
if a challenge is filed against a renewal application  and  as a result of an evidentiary hearing  the fcc determines that the licensee has failed to meet certain requirements and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction  the fcc may deny a license renewal application 
historically  fcc licenses have generally been renewed 
we have no reason to believe that our licenses will not be renewed in the ordinary course  although there can be no assurance to that effect 
the non renewal of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the fcc classifies each am and fm station 
each am station operates on either a clear channel  regional channel or local channel 
a clear channel is assigned to serve wide areas 
am stations are classified as class a  b  c or d depending on the type of channel and area they are designed to serve 
class a stations operate on an unlimited time basis and are designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended area 
class b stations operate on an unlimited time basis and are designed to render service only over a primary service area 
class c stations operate on a local channel and are designed to render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference 
class d stations operate either during daytime hours only  during limited times only or on an unlimited time basis with low nighttime power 
the fcc has authorized an additional khz of bandwidth for the am band and has allotted frequencies in this new band to certain existing am stations  including one of ours  subject to the requirement that at the end of a five year transition period  the licensees of those stations return to the fcc either the license for their existing am band or for the expanded am band facility 
upon the completion of this transition  some additional am stations may have improved coverage because of reduced interference within the existing band 
we have not yet evaluated the impact of the migration process on our business but we do not believe that such impact  if any  will be material 
the minimum and maximum facilities of an fm station are determined by its class 
some fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter site of the fm station is located 
in general  commercial fm stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing maximum power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c  c and c 
class c fm stations that do not meet certain minimum antenna height parameters are subject to an involuntary downgrade in class to class c under certain circumstances 
the following table listing each station that our subsidiaries own or operate sets forth the metropolitan market served the fcc designated city of license may differ  the call letters  fcc license classification  antenna height above average terrain haat  power  frequency and fcc license expiration date

pursuant to fcc rules and regulations  many am radio stations are licensed to operate at a reduced power during the nighttime broadcasting hours  which can result in reducing the radio station s coverage during the nighttime hours of operation 
both daytime and nighttime power ratings are shown  where applicable 
for fm stations  the maximum effective radiated power in the main lobe is given 
kslm am is licensed to salem  oregon  within the portland market and simulcasts kfxx am programming 
kcbz fm is licensed to cannon beach  oregon  which serves an area outside of the portland market 
the fcc rules require that by the end of a five year transition period  which expires in october  we must elect to operate on either the khz frequency or the khz frequency and surrender the other frequency to the fcc 
application for license renewal pending with the fcc 
transfers or assignment of licenses 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of broadcast licenses or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant such approval  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the existing licensee and the proposed licensee  including compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties in a given market  the character of the proposed licensee  and compliance with the communications act s limitations on alien ownership as well as compliance with other fcc regulations and policies 
to obtain fcc consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license  appropriate applications must be filed with the fcc 
interested parties may file objections or petitions to deny such applications 
when passing on an assignment or transfer application  the fcc is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by assignment or transfer of the broadcast license to any party other than the one specified in the application 
once an assignment or transfer application is granted  interested parties have days following public notice of the grant to seek reconsideration of that grant 
the fcc usually has an additional ten days to set aside the grant on its own motion 
the communications act permits certain court appeals of a contested grant as well 
multiple ownership rules 
the communications act imposes specific limits on the number of commercial radio stations an entity can own in a single market  and fcc rules and regulations in effect since have implemented these limitations 
on june   the fcc adopted new ownership rules following a comprehensive review of its ownership regulations  including new cross media limits that in certain markets eliminated the newspaper broadcast cross ownership ban and the television radio cross ownership ban  and regulations that revised the manner in which the radio numeric ownership limitations were to be applied  substituting where available geographic markets as determined by arbitron in place of the former standard which was based on certain overlapping signal contours 
as earlier discussed  however  the effectiveness of the new ownership rules has been stayed pending the outcome of litigation 
under the pending rules  if they become effective  for those markets where cross media limits were not eliminated  the broadcast newspaper cross ownership rule prevents the same owner from owning a broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same geographic market 
these rules may preclude us from acquiring certain stations we might otherwise seek to acquire or limit the prospective buyers in the market of any stations we may wish to sell 
the pending rules also effectively prevent us from selling stations in a market to a buyer that has reached its ownership limit in the market 
under both the existing and the pending rules  the number of radio stations that can be owned by a single entity in a local radio market  as defined under procedures adopted by the fcc  are the same in markets with or more commercial radio stations  ownership is limited to eight commercial stations  no more than five of which can be either am or fm  in markets with to commercial radio stations  ownership is limited to seven commercial stations  no more than four of which can be either am or fm  in markets with to commercial radio stations  ownership is limited to six commercial stations  no more than four of which can be either am or fm  and in markets with or fewer commercial radio stations  ownership is limited to five commercial stations or no more than of stations in the market  whichever is lower  and no more than three of which can be either am or fm 
for purposes of the numeric limitations under the existing rules  if a station is operated for more than of the hours of weekly operation under a local marketing or time brokerage agreement by a party owning another radio station in the same market  and there is significant contour overlap between the owned and the brokered station  both stations are treated as owned stations  under the pending rules  any station for which a party which owns stations in the same geographic market  as explained below  provides more than of the weekly hours of programming or sells more than of the weekly hours of advertising is treated as an owned station  without regard to contour overlap 
the existing rules define a local radio market by reference to certain overlapping signal contours of stations to be owned in common and other stations serving the same area 
under the pending rules  the fcc substituted geographic markets as defined by arbitron  where available  and applied the numeric limitations on ownership to all stations in the same market under common ownership  or  as noted above  control pursuant to a local marketing agreement or joint sales agreement 
the fcc applies its ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
in the case of corporations directly or indirectly controlling broadcast licenses  the following interests are generally considered to be attributable for purposes of the ownership rules the interests of officers or directors  a or greater direct or indirect voting interest  certain passive investor interests with a or greater voting interest  and equity and debt interests which combined exceed of a licensee s total assets  if the interest holder supplies more than of the total weekly programming of a licensee s station  or has any attributable interest in a broadcast station  cable television system  newspaper or other media outlet located in the same market 
under the attribution rules and policies  the fcc treats the equity interest of minority holders in an entity as generally not attributable if a single entity or individual holds or controls more than of that entity s votes 
the fcc made no changes in its attribution rules and policies in the pending rules  however  in a separate proceeding in january  the fcc eliminated the single majority shareholder exemption  but grandfathered minority interests owned before december  the elimination of this exemption has not been enforced following a court decision in december in which the elimination was held to be arbitrary and capricious as applied to the fcc s cable ownership rules  a rulemaking in which the fcc is reviewing the exemption is pending 
the fcc s attribution rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any market  and may limit the prospective buyers within the market of any stations that we may desire to sell 
alien ownership rules 
the communications act prohibits the issuance to or holding of broadcast licenses by foreign governments or aliens  non us citizens  whether individuals or entities  including any interest in a corporation which holds a broadcast license if more than of the capital stock is owned or voted by aliens 
in addition  the fcc may prohibit any corporation from holding a broadcast license if the corporation is directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens if the fcc finds that the prohibition is in the public interest 
these restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations  including partnerships and llcs 
our articles of incorporation prohibit the ownership  voting and transfer of our capital stock in violation of the fcc restrictions  and prohibit the issuance of capital stock or the voting rights such capital stock represents to or for the account of aliens or corporations otherwise subject to control by aliens in excess of the fcc limits 
the articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to enforce these prohibitions 
in addition  the articles of incorporation provide that shares of our capital stock determined by our board of directors to be owned beneficially by an alien or an entity directly or indirectly owned by aliens in whole or in part shall be subject to redemption by us by action of the board of directors to the extent necessary  in the judgment of the board of directors  to comply with these alien ownership restrictions 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
the fcc gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed in the past to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station s community of license 
a licensee continues to be required  however  to present programming that is responsive to issues of the station s community of license and to maintain records demonstrating this responsiveness 
complaints from listeners concerning a station s programming often will be considered by the fcc when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee  but may be considered by the fcc at anytime 
stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the communications act that regulate  among other things  political advertising  sponsorship identifications  the advertisement of contests and lotteries  obscene and indecent broadcasts  and technical operations  including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation 
the fcc restricts the broadcast of indecent programming and prohibits the broadcast of obscene programming 
recently  the fcc has received an increasing number of complaints alleging that broadcast stations have carried indecent programming at times when children may be in the audience  in violation of federal criminal law and the fcc s policies  which prohibit programming that is defined as indecent under fcc policies during the hours of am until pm  and the fcc has greatly intensified its enforcement activities with respect to such material 
not only have the maximum monetary fines for such proven violations of fcc policies been increased to  per occurrence  proposals have been discussed in congress to increase the potential fines substantially higher and the fcc has warned broadcasters that future serious violations may result in the commencement of revocation proceedings 
a congressional hearing with regard to such programming matters was held on january  the fcc has notified us in several instances that complaints have been received with respect to several of our stations concerning the broadcast of allegedly indecent programming  we have successfully defended several of these complaints and are continuing to defend our programming in three pending proceedings 
on november   the fcc adopted new rules prohibiting employment discrimination by broadcast stations on the basis of race  religion  color  national origin  and gender  and requiring broadcasters to implement programs to promote equal employment opportunities at their stations 
these rules replaced earlier rules that were found by the court of appeals for the district of columbia to be unconstitutional 
the new rules generally require broadcasters to refrain from discrimination in hiring and promotion  to widely disseminate information about all full time job openings to all segments of the community to ensure that all qualified applicants have sufficient opportunity to apply for the job  to send job vacancy announcements to recruitment organizations and others in the community indicating an interest in all or some vacancies at the station  and to implement a number of specific longer term recruitment outreach efforts  such as job fairs  internship programs  and interaction with educational and community groups from among a menu of approaches itemized by the fcc 
the rules were effective on march  the applicability of these policies to part time employment opportunities is the subject of a pending further rule making proceeding 
we employ a number of on air personalities and generally enter into employment agreements with these personalities to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable 
the loss of some of these personalities could result in a short term loss of audience share  but we do not believe that the loss would have a material adverse effect on our business 
proposed and recent changes 
congress and the fcc may in the future consider and adopt new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect  directly or indirectly  the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations  and affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or to finance those acquisitions 
such matters may include imposition or increases in regulatory fees  spectrum use fees  or other fees on fcc licenses  foreign ownership of broadcast licenses  revisions to the fcc s rules relating to political broadcasting  including free air time to candidates  adoption of new technical rules and frequency allocation matters  proposals to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenses by advertisers  proposals to regulate or prohibit payments to stations by independent record promoters  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages on radio  and changes in the fcc s ownership and attribution policies  including the definition of the local market for multiple ownership purposes see multiple ownership rules 
the fcc has selected the in band on channel as the exclusive technology for introduction of terrestrial digital operations by am and fm radio stations 
the fcc has authorized the commencement of hybrid in band on channel transmissions  that is  simultaneous broadcast in both digital and analog format  after receipt of individual grant of special temporary authority by the fcc pending the adoption of formal licensing and service rules 
the advantages of digital audio broadcasting over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services 
in band on channel technology permits a station to transmit radio programming in both analog and digital formats  and eventually in digital only formats  using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use 
it is unclear what impact the introduction of digital broadcasting will have on the radio market in which we compete 
finally  the fcc has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed for new or major change applications that are mutually exclusive 
such procedures may limit our efforts to build new stations  or to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our existing stations 
we cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the fcc or congress  nor can we judge in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business 
federal antitrust laws 
the agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws ie  the federal trade commission and the department of justice may investigate certain acquisitions 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific department of justice or federal trade commission investigation 
any decision by the federal trade commission or the department of justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms 
for an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds  the hart scott rodino act requires the parties to file notification and report forms with the federal trade commission and the department of justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
if the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction  then the parties frequently engage in lengthy discussions or negotiations with the investigating agency concerning possible means of addressing those issues  including restructuring the proposed acquisition or divesting assets 
in addition  the investigating agency could file suit in federal court to enjoin the acquisition or to require the divestiture of assets  among other remedies 
acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the hart scott rodino act may be investigated by the federal trade commission or the department of justice under the antitrust laws before or after consummation 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
as part of its increased scrutiny of radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that local marketing agreements  joint sales agreements  time brokerage agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers could violate the hart scott rodino act if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act 
furthermore  the department of justice has noted that joint sales agreements may raise antitrust concerns under section of the sherman act and has challenged joint sales agreements in certain locations 
the department of justice also has stated publicly that it has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to radio station acquisitions  above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny 
to date  the department of justice has also investigated transactions that do not meet or exceed these benchmarks  however  and has cleared transactions that do exceed these benchmarks

we operate in markets  including boston  seattle  denver  portland  sacramento  kansas city  milwaukee  norfolk  new orleans  buffalo  greensboro  memphis  rochester  greenville spartanburg  wilkes barre scranton  wichita  madison  gainesville ocala and longview kelso wa 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers by selling advertisers access to its radio stations base of listeners 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of and demand for radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from net national spot advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation  radio station events and rental income from tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  and programming and promotional expenses 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
additionally  as opportunities arise  we may on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and there are no guarantees that the modification or change to a station s format will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with any change to a station s format 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
we strive to develop strong listener loyalty as audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success 
we include in our net revenues those net revenues recognized under a time brokerage agreement or a similar sales agreement for stations operated by us prior to acquiring the stations  and reflect operating expenses associated with these stations in station operating expenses 
consequently  there is no difference in the method of revenue and operating expense recognition between a station operated by us under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement and a station which we own and operate 
depending on the facts and circumstances related to each time brokerage agreement  the assets and liabilities associated with a time brokerage agreement may be included in our consolidated balance sheet under the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which would include any variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
more information on this interpretation by the financial accounting standards board is described in note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated pursuant to time brokerage agreements or joint sales agreements during the relevant periods 
the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year acquisitions on july  we acquired for million two radio stations in denver that we began operating on february  under a time brokerage agreement  which resulted in an increase in of our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and lowered interest income and time brokerage agreement fees  on march  we acquired for million a radio station in denver that we began operating on february  under a time brokerage agreement  which resulted in an increase in of our net revenues  station operating expenses  and depreciation and amortization expense and lowered time brokerage fees and interest income  on may  we acquired for million a radio station in denver  that we began operating on march  under a time brokerage agreement  which resulted in an increase in of our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and lowered time brokerage agreement fees and interest income  we amended an agreement that  effective february   allowed us to sell advertising associated with the seattle seahawks  which resulted in an increase in of our station net revenues and station operating expenses  we acquired on may  a radio station in sacramento  which resulted in an increase in of our net revenues  station operating expenses  and depreciation and amortization expense  and on december  we acquired for million two radio stations in portland that we began operating june  under a time brokerage agreement  which resulted in an increase in of our net revenues  station operating expenses  time brokerage agreement fees  depreciation and amortization expense and interest 
dispositions we terminated as of february   our joint sales agreement to sell advertising time broadcast on king fm in seattle  which resulted in a decrease in of our net revenues and station operating expenses  our agreement for the rights to broadcast the seattle mariners baseball club expired in october  which resulted in a decrease in of our net revenues and station operating expenses  we did not incur any costs in in connection with an equity investment in an internet venture that ceased operations during which in resulted in an equity loss from an unconsolidated affiliate  and on november   we disposed of a radio station in portland for million  which resulted in a decrease in of our net revenues  station operating expenses  interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
financing we received net proceeds of million from the march offering of our senior subordinated notes  which resulted in increased interest expense in  we used a portion of the million in net proceeds from the march equity offering for reducing outstanding indebtedness of million under our bank facility s revolver  which resulted in decreased interest expense in  and we allowed derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with total notional amounts of million and million to expire during and  respectively  without entering into new derivatives  which lowered interest expense in as these derivatives had increased our effective interest rate on our senior debt 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated pursuant to time brokerage agreements or joint sales agreements during the relevant periods 
we also discuss net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant year to the performance of those same stations in the prior year whether or not owned or operated by us 
included in the comparisons that follow are significant contracts that relate to station operations  have a significant effect on the net revenues and or station operating expenses of a particular market  and we account for as separate business units 
we also use these comparisons to assess the performance of our operations by analyzing the effect of acquisitions and dispositions of stations and changes in status of significant contracts on net revenues and station operating expenses throughout the periods measured 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues december  december  amounts in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change increased net revenues in our denver  portland  boston and sacramento markets contributed most to our overall net revenue increases in  which more than compensated for a net revenue decrease in the seattle market 
the decrease in the seattle market was primarily as a result of the termination of the following significant contracts an agreement with the seattle mariners baseball club and a joint sales agreement to sell advertising time on king fm

the advertising contracts that impacted amortization expense during the years ended december  and  were acquired in connection with the acquisition of radio station assets in the greensboro and denver markets 
corporate general and administrative expenses december  december  amounts in millions corporate general and administrative expenses amount of change percentage change the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in accounting fees primarily as a result of regulatory changes affecting public companies and the effects of inflation 
non cash compensation expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the recognition in of million in non cash compensation expense from the may  modification of option grants for then retiring members of our board of directors

we also completed the transitional non amortizing intangible asset impairment test for broadcasting licenses and recorded to the statement of operations  a million charge  net of a deferred tax benefit of million  under the cumulative effect of accounting change 
we also completed the transitional assessment of goodwill and determined that the carrying amount of each of our markets did not exceed the fair value

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have not paid any dividends see part ii  item for a discussion of dividends and instead  we used a significant portion of our capital resources to reduce outstanding debt and to consummate acquisitions 
generally  these acquisitions are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our bank facility described below  the issuance and sale of our securities  the swapping of our radio stations in transactions which qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code  and internally generated cash flow 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases in our net cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily a result of increased advertising revenues that were only partially offset by increased station operating expenses  which  in both cases  were affected by the acquisitions and dispositions of stations during those periods 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a reduction in our interest expense  a reduction in time brokerage agreement fees owed to third parties  and an improvement in net revenues  net of station operating expenses

under this shelf registration statement  on february   we entered into separate equity and debt underwriting agreements for equity and debt offerings and filed prospectus supplements with the sec 
we completed the equity offering on march  and the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option on march  in total  we issued million in class a common stock at a price per share of 
we completed the debt offering on march   and issued million in senior subordinated notes 
we received net proceeds of approximately million under the equity offerings and incurred offering expenses of approximately million 
we received net proceeds of approximately million under the debt offering and incurred offering expenses of approximately million 
we used a portion of the net proceeds as follows i to reduce our outstanding indebtedness in the amount of million under the bank facility s revolver  ii to finance acquisitions  iii for general corporate purposes  and iv for working capital 
under our universal shelf registration statement that was filed during february  we may from time to time  subject to market conditions  offer and issue debentures  notes  bonds and other evidence of indebtedness in an aggregate amount up to million and shares of our class a common stock and or preferred stock in an aggregate offering price of up to million 
unless otherwise described in future prospectus supplements  we expect to use the net proceeds from any future sale of securities  if any  registered under this universal shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes  which may include additions to working capital  capital expenditures  repayment or redemption of existing indebtedness  or acquisitions 
on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt 
as a result of their review  our credit rating could change 
management believes that any significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact on our future liquidity 
the effect of a change in our credit rating may include  among other things  interest rate changes under any future bank facilities  debentures  notes or other types of debt 
on march   we issued a notice of our intention to redeem on april   all of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures 
this redemption resulted in the corresponding redemption of the tides issued by entercom communications capital trust 
prior to the redemption  holders of million tides converted their securities into million shares of our class a common stock 
on april   the trust paid million to the remaining tides holders in exchange for the remaining million tides 
we used million from cash on hand and million from our bank facility s revolver to meet the cash requirements for this redemption 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   we decreased our net outstanding debt by million and acquired radio station assets in the amount of million 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our bank facility in addition to an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of million and million in senior subordinated notes 
we prepaid in advance of the due dates  the principal in the amount of million that was due for each of the calendar year quarters ended in we expect to use the credit available of million under the revolving credit facility  subject to defined revolving commitment reductions as described below  and cash on hand to fund future acquisitions 
in order to finance future acquisitions  if any  however  we may require additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us 
in addition to future acquisitions  we also could consider the payment of outstanding debt  the payment of a dividend and or the buyback of our class a common stock 
our business generally does not require substantial investment of capital 
in addition to debt service  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and acquisitions of additional radio stations 
in the year  we utilized our federal and state corporate income tax net operating loss carryovers that had accumulated over the past several years  to offset our income tax obligations for this year 
our corporate income tax obligations in will be considerably higher than due to the absence of these operating loss carryovers 
our capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   as compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures increased for the year ended december  as compared to the prior years  primarily due to the continued relocation and consolidation of studio facilities in certain markets 
for the year  we estimate that capital expenditures  necessary for maintaining and upgrading our facilities  will be between million and million 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the bank facility revolver  should be sufficient to permit us to fund our capital expenditure requirements  meet our financial obligations and fund our operations 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure requirements  meet our financial obligations and fund our operations could be adversely impacted  however  by factors such as prolonged downturns in the economy  poor performance by our stations  increased competition from other media  and other factors that could be a result of world events 
we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing from time to time 
our bank facility requires that at the time of closing on transactions  we must be in compliance with the terms of the bank facility 
we believe that we will maintain compliance with the terms of our bank facility 
if we are not in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in amending or entering into a new bank facility  obtaining additional financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  which could delay or impair our efforts to consummate future transactions 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of the agreement could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding debt 
we entered into our bank facility as of december   with a syndicate of banks for million in senior credit initially consisting of million in a reducing revolving credit facility and million in a multi draw term loan that was fully drawn as of september  our bank facility was established  and has been used  to a refinance existing indebtedness  b provide working capital  and c fund corporate acquisitions 
at our election  interest on any outstanding principal accrues at a rate based on either libor plus a spread that ranges from to or on the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
under the bank facility  the reducing revolving credit facility and the multi draw term loan mature on september  and reduce on a quarterly basis that began september  in amounts that vary from million to million for each loan 
we anticipate that we will meet these quarterly debt reduction commitments through one or more of the following i cash flows from operations  ii additional permitted borrowings  if any  under the reducing revolving credit facility  iii cash on hand  and iv other debt or equity offerings 
our bank facility requires that we comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios that are defined terms within the agreement 
compliance with these requirements affects our ability to draw down under the revolver 
certain of these financial covenants and leverage ratios include but are not limited to the following a total debt to operating cash flow  b operating cash flow to interest expense  c operating cash flow to pro forma debt service  and d operating cash flow to fixed charges 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants and leverage ratios as of december  and management believes we are in compliance with all other terms of the agreement 
on march   we entered into an amendment with our lenders under our bank facility that permitted us to redeem the convertible preferred securities  term income deferrable equity securities tides and modified the terms for insurance coverage 
contractual obligations the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total a under our bank facility  the maturity on our outstanding debt of million could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants 
b under our million senior subordinated notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to the due date of the notes 
a in connection with extensive litigation  on may   we acquired a radio station for a purchase price of million 
as described below under part ii  item  legal proceedings  a successful appeal by the seller could award the seller up to million in damages 
b we have certain liabilities of million related to our obligation to provide a letter of credit  a contingent obligation to a national sales representative of the former owner of one of our markets  an obligation to increase our interest in a partnership  carried as an investment  and construction obligations in connection with the relocation and consolidation of certain of our studio facilities 
c in addition to the above  purchase obligations of million include contracts for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees and television advertising 
included in other long term liabilities of million are deferred income tax liabilities of million that are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
deferred tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates and the operating results of our company 
as a result  it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  deferred income tax liabilities have been reflected in more than years 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our bank facility 
an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  was immaterial 
we enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recently issued pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board or fasb  issued financial interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which requires all variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the variable interest entity 
in addition  the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as variable interest entities from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests  but not the majority 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation were effective for all financial statements issued after january  the consolidation requirements of this interpretation were effective for us as of december  we did not have any such variable interest entities as of december  and accordingly  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the future  however  we may have interests in variable interest entities that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  management believes that based upon our current derivative position  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity  by now requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities or assets in some circumstances in the balance sheet 
sfas no 
affects an entity s classification of the mandatorily redeemable instruments  financial instruments to repurchase an entity s own equity instruments and financial instruments embodying obligations that the issuer must or could choose to settle by issuing a variable number of its shares or other equity instruments based entirely on a fixed monetary amount known at inception or something other than changes in its own equity instruments 
adoption of sfas no 
by us was effective as of june  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the emerging issues task force or eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on one issue with respect to eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  thereby requiring certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  that are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized 
adoption of eitf issue  which was effective for us on december   did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as we did not have any unrealized losses on investments as of december  see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the amount of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  these estimates have been a reliable method to recognize revenues and it is expected that this method would not change in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances  with historical reserves averaging less than of our outstanding receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required 
the effect of an increase in our allowance of of our outstanding receivables as of december   from to or million to million  would result in a decrease in net income of million  net of taxes  for the year ended december  radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december  we had recorded approximately billion in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and our estimate of the value contains assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables would include but not be limited to the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures and the likely media competition within the market area 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of taxes  for broadcasting licenses in certain of our markets 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets could result in future period write downs in the carrying value of these assets 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of effective tax rates we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
tax contingencies are also recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimate of the value of our tax contingencies is a critical accounting estimate as it contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
our estimate of our effective tax rates has not changed significantly in past years  with rates that ranged from to 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rates as of december   would result in an increase of million from million to million in income tax expense for the year ended december  intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages  and equipment 
the exact impact is indeterminable 
risk factors many statements contained in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current plans  intentions or expectations and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans  intentions or expectations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following we face many unpredictable business risks  both general and specific to the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business including economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  technological changes and innovations  new laws  including proposals to eliminate the tax deductibility of certain expenses incurred by advertisers  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequently  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations  or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues 
our radio broadcasting stations are in a highly competitive business 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change  and any change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market 
while we already compete in some of our markets with other stations with similar programming formats  if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations  if a new station were to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act see for example  the discussion of fcc regulations contained in part i  item i of this form k 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
for example  in connection with the sinclair kansas city acquisition we were required to dispose of three radio stations in kansas city 
the fcc s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on our operations  and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be successful in identifying and consummating future acquisitions  which is an important element of our business strategy 
we pursue growth  in part  through the acquisition of individual radio stations and groups of radio stations 
our consummation of all future acquisitions will be subject to various conditions  including fcc and other regulatory approvals 
the fcc must approve any transfer of control or assignment of broadcast licenses 
in addition  acquisitions may encounter intense scrutiny under federal and state antitrust laws 
our future acquisitions may be subject to notification under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and to a waiting period and possible review by the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
any delays  injunctions  conditions or modifications by any of these federal agencies could have a negative effect on us and result in the abandonment of all or part of attractive acquisition opportunities 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in identifying future acquisition opportunities or what the consequences will be of any acquisitions 
depending on the nature  size and timing of future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
radio broadcasting is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
in this environment  we compete and will continue to compete with many other buyers for the acquisition of radio stations 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions is uncertain 
we may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions 
the integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the management of a large and geographically diverse group of stations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees of acquired stations  and the risk of integration is higher during a period of significant or rapid growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management that might be acquired in the future 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new business do not meet expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the new business 
we have substantial indebtedness that could have important consequences to you 
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity 
at december   we had long term indebtedness of million excluding outstanding letters of credit of million and shareholders equity of billion 
this indebtedness is substantial in amount and could have an impact on you 
for example  these obligations could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including funding future expansion and ongoing capital expenditures  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
as of december   million was available under our million current bank facility  subject to compliance with the covenants under the bank facility at the time of borrowing and subject to quarterly debt reduction commitments 
moreover  under certain circumstances  we may need to modify or enter into a new bank facility to close on any future acquisitions 
we also may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing for any of the following transactions the acquisition of radio stations  the full or partial redemption of our outstanding debt and or the payment of a dividend  and or the buyback of our class a common stock 
we have no assurances that we will be able to obtain other funding  additional financing or the approvals  if necessary  for any of these transactions 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our indebtedness and the associated risks 
the covenants in our credit facility and our senior subordinated notes restrict our financial and operational flexibility 
our credit facility and our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  or merge or consolidate 
an event of default under our bank facility or our senior subordinated notes could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries 
if the amounts outstanding under the senior subordinated notes were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against the stock of our subsidiaries 
a default under our senior subordinated notes could cause a default under our credit facility 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our bank facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios 
we also may incur future debt obligations in connection with future acquisitions that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
the debt we expect to incur in connection with future acquisitions may require us to modify or enter into a new bank facility if certain covenants in our current bank facility would be violated  subjecting us to an event of default 
because of our holding company structure  we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow  and our access to this cash flow is restricted 
we operate as a holding company 
all of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries 
entercom radio  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  is the borrower under our credit facility and our senior subordinated debt 
all of our station operating subsidiaries are subsidiaries of entercom radio  llc 
further  we guaranteed entercom radio  llc s obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis and under the senior subordinated notes on an unsecured basis  junior to our credit facility 
as a holding company  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  including corporate overhead and other trade payables  are distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow 
we currently expect that the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations  including servicing their debt obligations  before distributions are made to us 
even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us  we cannot assure you that applicable state law and contractual restrictions  including the dividend covenants contained in our credit facility and senior subordinated notes  would permit such dividends or distributions 
our chairman of the board and our president and chief executive officer effectively control our company  and members of their immediate family also own a substantial equity interest in us 
their interests may conflict with yours 
as of february   joseph m 
field  our chairman of the board  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
as of february   david j 
field  our president  chief executive officer  one of our directors and the son of joseph m 
field  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our outstanding class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
collectively  joseph m 
field and david j 
field and other members of the field family beneficially own all of our outstanding class b common stock 
other members of the field family also own shares of class a common stock 
shares of class b common stock are transferable only to joseph m 
field  david j 
field  certain of their family members or trusts for any of their benefit 
upon any other transfer  shares of our class b common stock convert automatically into shares of our class a common stock on a share for share basis 
shares of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes only when they are voted by joseph m 
field or david j 
field  subject to certain exceptions where they are restricted to one vote 
joseph m 
field generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to the vote of shareholders and  therefore  is able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters where the shares of our class b common stock are only entitled to one vote and those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws or applicable law  including  without limitation  the election of the two class a directors 
without the approval of joseph m 
field  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which investors might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
we depend on selected market clusters of radio stations 
for the year ended december   we generated almost of our net revenues in of our markets seattle  boston  kansas city and sacramento 
accordingly we may have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions that affect the economy in any of these markets that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including the following satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on the financial condition and results of operations of our company 
our stock price could be volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
our class a common stock has been publicly traded since january  the market price of our class a common stock has been subject to fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
the stock market has from time to time experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could materially decline  regardless of our operating performance 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key executives 
we believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
you will have no recourse against one of the experts named in this document 
arthur andersen llp is unable to consent to the use of their independent public accountants report with respect to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which financial statements have been incorporated by reference in this document 
this means that arthur andersen llp is not reconfirming the continuing validity of its audit opinion on these financial statements 
although we have no reason to believe that those financial statements are incorrect  if they are incorrect and we are adversely affected as a result  you will not be able to recover any damages you may incur from arthur andersen llp 
we are subject to general changes in the economy that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
any adverse change in the us economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and on the future price of our class a common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank facility 
under certain bank facility covenants that are measured periodically  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
if the borrowing rates under libor were to increase above the current rates as of december   our interest expense under our bank facility would increase approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest expense associated with the use of derivative rate hedging instruments as described below 
we do not have significant interest rate risk related to our senior subordinated notes  which has a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had a derivative rate hedging transaction in place for a notional amount of million that effectively fixes libor at and expires in the fair value of the rate hedging transaction at december   based upon current market rates  is included as derivative instruments in other long term liabilities according to the maturity date of the instrument 
our rate hedging transaction is tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis
