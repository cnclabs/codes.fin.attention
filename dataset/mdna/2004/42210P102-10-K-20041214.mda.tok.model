item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
headwaters fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  future references to years refer to headwaters fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
introduction over the last three years  headwaters has executed on its two fold plan of maximizing cash flow from its existing operating business units and diversifying revenues from reliance on the alternative energy segment 
with the addition of the ccp management and marketing business through the acquisition of isg in  and the growth of the construction materials business culminating in the acquisitions of eldorado and tapco in  headwaters has achieved revenue growth and diversification into three business segments 
because headwaters has also incurred increased indebtedness to make strategic acquisitions and related capital expenditures  one of management s key financial objectives is to continue to focus on increased cash flows for purposes of reducing indebtedness as quickly as possible 
headwaters acquisition strategy targets businesses that are leading players in their respective industries  enjoy healthy margins from products and services and are not capital intensive  thus providing additional cash flow that complements the financial performance of headwaters existing business segments 
headwaters is also committed to the internal development of its energy related technologies and nanotechnology through hti  it has invested in and expects to continue to maintain its research and development activities 
as a result of its diversification into ccps and construction materials  headwaters is affected by seasonality  with its highest revenues produced in the june and september quarters 
with ccps  headwaters strategy is to continue to negotiate long term contracts so that it may invest in transport and storage infrastructure for the management and sale of ccps 
headwaters also intends to continue to expand usage of high value ccps  develop uses for lower value ccps and expand usage of ccps both in its construction products and the industry in general 
headwaters acquisitions of eldorado and tapco have created a concentration in the residential housing market  however  the cyclicality and interest rate sensitivity of this business is mitigated by the fact that approximately of tapco s products are used in the home improvement and remodeling market  which is typically counter cyclical to the new construction market because remodeling is generally less expensive than a new home and is often required to maintain older homes and preserve their value 
as a result  during economic downturns  tapco s products have experienced strong growth rates 
in light of headwaters leading market shares in edorado s and tapco s markets  headwaters will need to increase production capacity for eldorado and develop and promote new products from tapco in order to continue the current growth rate in this segment 
in fiscal  headwaters will focus on integration of its new acquisitions  including the marketing of diverse construction materials products through its national distribution network  and expansion of the corporate infrastructure necessary to provide the information and services that the business segments need to operate at optimal levels 
headwaters is highly leveraged as a result of the acquisitions 
this leverage makes continued diversification at historical levels more difficult 
headwaters intends to focus on repaying its current debt as quickly as possible while continuing to look for diversification opportunities within prescribed parameters 
consolidation  acquisitions and segments consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of its subsidiaries and other entities in which headwaters has a controlling financial interest 
headwaters also consolidates any variable interest entities for which it is the primary beneficiary  however as of september   there are none 
for investments in companies in which headwaters has a significant influence over operating and financial decisions generally defined as owning a voting or economic interest of to  headwaters applies the equity method of accounting 
in instances where headwaters investment is less than and significant influence does not exist  investments are carried at cost 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
headwaters acquired isg on september  and accordingly  isg s results of operations for the period from september  through september  have been consolidated with headwaters through results 
isg s results of operations up to september  have not been included in headwaters consolidated results for any period 
headwaters acquired vfl on april   eldorado stone on june   scp on july   and tapco on september  these entities results of operations for the periods from the acquisition dates through september  have been consolidated with headwaters results and their operations up to the dates of acquisition have not been included in headwaters consolidated results for any period 
due to the time required to obtain accurate financial information related to hti s foreign contracts  for financial reporting purposes hti s financial statements have historically been consolidated with headwaters financial statements using a one month lag 
effective october   headwaters eliminated this one month lag because of the decreased significance of hti s foreign contracts 
accordingly  months of hti s results of operations have been included in the consolidated statement of income for acquisitions 
as described in the following paragraphs  headwaters acquired four companies in and one company in due to the significance of these acquisitions  in many instances the consolidated financial statements and components of those financial statements discussed in the following discussion and analysis are not comparable to prior years financial statements or components thereof 
vfl on april   headwaters acquired of the common stock of vfl technology corporation vfl and assumed all of vfl s outstanding debt 
vfl is based in west chester  pennsylvania and manages approximately two million tons of ccps annually 
in addition  vfl has operating knowledge relating to the use of low quality ccp materials in value added applications 
the acquisition of vfl broadens the scope of services that headwaters ccp segment offers  as well as its client base  principally on the east coast of the united states and in the ohio river valley 
vfl s results of operations have been included in headwaters consolidated statement of income since april  the vfl acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
the consideration headwaters paid for vfl was negotiated at arms length and assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of april  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets consisting of contracts with utility companies  industrial clients and municipalities 
this amount is being amortized over an estimated average useful life of eight years 
the remaining purchase price not attributable to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill  all of which is expected to be tax deductible 
all of the intangible assets and goodwill have been allocated to headwaters ccp segment 
eldorado on june   headwaters acquired of the ownership interests of eldorado stone llc eldorado and paid off all of eldorado s outstanding debt 
eldorado is based in san marcos  california and is a leading manufacturer of architectural manufactured stone 
with over distributors  eldorado provides headwaters with a national platform for expanded marketing of green building products  such as mortar and stucco  by using higher amounts of fly ash 
headwaters expects eldorado  which is included in its construction materials segment  to provide critical mass and improved margins in headwaters efforts to expand the use of fly ash in building products 
eldorado s results of operations have been included in headwaters consolidated statement of income since june  the eldorado acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the consideration headwaters paid for eldorado was negotiated at arms length and assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of june  eldorado has experienced significant growth over the last two years 
eldorado sells its products through an extensive distribution network 
in addition  eldorado employs a group of talented artists who create the molds used to produce the manufactured stone product 
the quality of these molds adds significant value to the end product 
eldorado s manufacturing process  market presence and the quality of its product  including product design and product breadth  are major elements contributing to eldorado s high value and related purchase price 
these items  combined with eldorado s high growth and extensive distribution network are not separable and  accordingly  contribute to a significant amount of goodwill 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets  consisting primarily of non compete agreements 
the intangible assets are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years  with a combined weighted average life of approximately four years 
the remaining purchase price not attributable to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill  most of which is expected to be tax deductible 
all of the intangible assets and goodwill have been allocated to headwaters construction materials segment 
the determination of the final purchase price is subject to potential adjustments related to the working capital acquired at closing 
in addition  the purchase price allocation will likely differ from that reflected in the consolidated financial statements after final asset valuation reports are received and a detailed review of all assets and liabilities  including income taxes  has been completed 
pre acquisition contingencies  which are not material  are included in the value of liabilities assumed as of june  and any change from the recorded amounts is expected to be immaterial 
the final purchase price allocation is expected to be completed by march  any changes to the purchase price allocation are not expected to materially increase or decrease depreciation and amortization expense  but may have a material effect on the amount of recorded goodwill 
scp on july   headwaters acquired certain assets of southwest concrete products  lp scp and assumed all of scp s outstanding debt 
scp is based in alleyton  texas and is a leading manufacturer of concrete blocks in south texas  complementing headwaters similar operations in dallas and east texas 
scp provides headwaters with modern concrete based manufacturing facilities and the opportunity to increase the use of ccps in the manufacture of block and brick 
scp also has an experienced management team and the president of scp subsequently assumed responsibility for all of headwaters construction materials operations other than for eldorado and tapco 
scp s results of operations have been included in headwaters consolidated statement of income since july  headwaters also agreed to pay an earn out to the sellers if certain earnings targets are exceeded during the months ending december  the earn out period 
the additional earn out consideration will be the product of times the amount  if any  that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of scp exceeds million during the earn out period 
if any earn out consideration is paid  which will not occur until  goodwill will be increased accordingly 
the scp acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the consideration headwaters paid for scp was negotiated at arms length and assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of july  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets  consisting primarily of customer relationships 
the intangible assets are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from two to ten years  with a combined weighted average life of approximately seven years 
the remaining purchase price not attributable to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill  substantially all of which is expected to be tax deductible 
all of the intangible assets and goodwill have been allocated to headwaters construction materials segment 
tapco on september   headwaters acquired of the ownership interests of tapco holdings  inc tapco and paid off all of tapco s outstanding debt 
tapco is headquartered in wixom  michigan and is a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of specialty building products and professional tools used in exterior residential home improvement and construction throughout the united states and canada 
headwaters expects the tapco acquisition to further diversify headwaters cash flow stream away from its historical reliance on alternative energy 
tapco brings economy of scale and manufacturing expertise that results in some of the lowest manufacturing costs in the siding accessory industry  which is expected to improve margins in headwaters construction materials segment 
headwaters may also be able to leverage tapco s distribution networks to accelerate sales of headwaters diverse construction materials product portfolio 
tapco s results of operations have been included in headwaters consolidated statement of income beginning september  the tapco acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the consideration headwaters paid for tapco was negotiated at arms length and assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of september  tapco has a leading market share in most of its product lines with some lines having a market share greater than 
tapco has the ability to deliver its products within a few days of receiving the order which is appealing to architects  contractors and end users of the product 
tapco also offers wide ranging product choices delivered through an extensive distribution network throughout the united states 
tapco s products  manufacturing process and distributors are currently substantially different than those utilized by headwaters other business units and a substantial amount of sales relate to the remodeling industry 
as such  tapco may further mitigate the cyclical nature of headwaters construction materials business in the future 
tapco s primary value  therefore  is due to its significant market presence and manufacturing efficiencies 
these values are largely the result of tapco s manufacturing and distribution capacities  product breadth and workforce which are not separable and  accordingly  contribute to a significant amount of goodwill 
the final purchase price and the allocation thereof will differ from that reflected in the consolidated financial statements after final fixed asset and intangible asset valuation reports are received and a detailed review of all assets and liabilities  including income taxes  has been completed 
the final purchase price allocation is expected to be completed by june  the final purchase price allocation is not expected to materially increase or decrease depreciation and amortization expense from the amounts recorded in and the amounts expected to be recorded in future periods  nor is it expected to have a material effect on the identified assets or liabilities  including goodwill 
isg acquisition on september   headwaters acquired of the common stock of isg  assumed or paid off all of isg s outstanding debt and redeemed all of isg s outstanding preferred stock 
isg is the leading provider of high value ccps to the building products and ready mix concrete industries in the united states 
isg also develops  manufactures and distributes value added bagged concrete  stucco  mortar and block products that utilize fly ash through its construction materials segment 
headwaters historical focus has been on using technology to add value to fossil fuels  particularly coal 
the acquisition of isg provided headwaters with a significant position in the last phase of the coal value chain due to isg s competencies in managing ccps 
the acquisition of isg also brought to headwaters management depth  corporate infrastructure and critical mass in revenues and operating income 
the isg acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of september  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets consisting primarily of contracts with coal fueled electric power generation plants and patents 
this amount is being amortized over the estimated combined useful life of approximately years 
the remaining purchase price not attributable to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets was allocated to goodwill  none of which is tax deductible 
all of the intangible assets and all of the goodwill were allocated to the ccp segment 
segments 
until headwaters acquired isg in september  headwaters operated in and reported as a single industry segment  alternative energy 
since the acquisition of isg  headwaters has operated in three business segments  alternative energy  ccps  and construction materials 
vfl operates in the ccp segment and all of the other businesses acquired by headwaters in operate in the construction materials segment 
these segments are managed and evaluated separately by management based on fundamental differences in their operations  products and services 
the alternative energy segment includes headwaters traditional coal based solid alternative fuels business and hti s business of developing catalyst technologies to convert coal and heavy oil into environmentally friendly  higher value liquid fuels  as well as nanocatalyst processes and applications 
revenues for this segment primarily include sales of chemical reagents and license fees 
the ccp segment markets coal combustion products such as fly ash and bottom ash  known as ccps  to the building products and ready mix concrete industries 
headwaters markets ccps to replace manufactured or mined materials  such as portland cement  lime  agricultural gypsum  fired lightweight aggregate  granite aggregate and limestone 
headwaters has long term contracts  primarily with coal fueled electric power generation plants pursuant to which it manages the post combustion operations for the utilities 
ccp revenues consist primarily of product sales with a smaller amount of service revenue 
prior to  the businesses in the construction materials segment manufactured and distributed value added bagged concrete  stucco  mortar and block products 
the acquisition of scp expanded headwaters concrete block business and the acquisition of eldorado added manufactured architectural stone to the construction materials product line 
tapco is a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of building products used in exterior residential home improvement and construction 
revenues for the construction materials segment consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products and construction materials 
critical accounting policies and estimates headwaters significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
headwaters continually evaluates its policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of headwaters accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with headwaters audit committee 
the following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
license fee revenue recognition 
headwaters currently licenses its technologies to the owners of coal based solid alternative fuel facilities in the united states 
recurring license fees or royalty payments are recognized in the period when earned  which coincides with the sale of synthetic fuel by headwaters licensees 
in most instances  headwaters receives timely reports from licensees notifying headwaters of the amount of solid synthetic fuel sold and the royalty due headwaters under the terms of the respective license fee agreements 
additionally  headwaters has experienced a regular pattern of payment by these licensees of the reported amounts 
estimates of license fee revenue earned  where required  can be reliably made based upon historical experience and or communications from licensees for whom an established pattern exists 
in some cases  however  such as when a licensee is beginning to produce and sell synthetic fuel or when a synthetic fuel facility is sold by a licensee to another entity  and for which there is no pattern or knowledge of past or current production and sales activity  there may be more limited information upon which to estimate the license fee revenue earned 
in these situations  headwaters uses such information as is available and where possible  substantiates the information through such procedures as observing the levels of chemical reagents purchased by the licensee and used in the production of the solid synthetic fuel 
in certain limited situations  headwaters is unable to reliably estimate the license fee revenues earned during a period  and therefore revenue recognition is delayed until a future date when sufficient information is known from which to make a reasonable estimation 
pursuant to the contractual terms of an agreement with one licensee  the license fees owed to headwaters  which accumulated during a period of approximately two and a half years  were placed in escrow for the benefit of headwaters  pending resolution of an audit of the licensee by the irs 
prior to december   accounting rules governing revenue recognition  requiring that the seller s price to the buyer be fixed or determinable as well as reasonably certain of collection  appeared to preclude revenue recognition for the amounts placed in escrow because they were potentially subject to adjustment based on the outcome of the irs audit 
accordingly  none of the escrowed amounts were recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of income through december  during the march quarter  the fieldwork for the tax audit of the licensee was completed and there were no proposed adjustments to the tax credits claimed by the licensee 
as a result  in march headwaters recognized revenue  net of the amount headwaters was required to pay to a third party  relating to the funds deposited in the escrow account totaling approximately million 
approximately million of this amount related to revenue recorded in the march quarter and approximately million was recorded as revenue related to prior periods 
interest income of approximately million was also recognized 
during the june quarter  the irs completed its administrative review of the licensee s tax audit and the escrowed amounts were disbursed from the escrow account and paid to headwaters 
in addition to the escrowed amounts  this same licensee has also set aside substantial amounts for working capital and other operational contingencies as provided for in the contractual agreements 
these amounts may eventually be paid out to various parties having an interest in the cash flows from the licensee s operations  including headwaters  if they are not used for working capital and other operational contingencies 
as a result  headwaters currently expects to receive at some future date a portion of those reserves  the amount of which is not currently determinable and therefore  not recognizable 
realizability of receivables 
allowances are provided for uncollectible accounts and notes when deemed necessary 
such allowances are based on an account by account analysis of collectibility or impairment plus a provision for non customer specific defaults based upon historical collection experience 
collateral is not required for trade receivables  but headwaters performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers 
collateral is generally required for notes receivable and has historically consisted of most or all assets of the debtor 
with regard to headwaters trade receivables from the alternative energy segment  past allowances have been minimal as have any required write offs 
trade receivables from the ccp and construction materials segments involve substantially more customers  and receivable allowances are required for discounts  rebates  allowances  and bad debts 
headwaters continually monitors the collectibility of its trade receivables 
net losses recognized on notes receivable were approximately million in  million in and million in such losses were recorded due to insufficient collateral  or declines in the value of the underlying collateral which management deemed other than temporary at the time 
notes receivable generally relate to nonoperating activities and accordingly  losses are included in other expense in the consolidated statements of income 
headwaters reviews collectibility of notes receivable at the end of each reporting period 
this collectibility review consists of consideration of payments of required interest and principal and the sufficiency of the collateral to support the outstanding note receivable balance 
if an impairment is indicated  headwaters writes down the note receivable to its estimated net realizable value 
headwaters considers its receivable allowances adequate as of september   however  changes in economic conditions generally or in specific markets in which headwaters operates could have a material effect on required reserve balances 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
see acquisitions above and note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions  including the valuations of intangible assets 
these intangible assets are being amortized on the straight line method over their remaining estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the fair value of identified assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
goodwill is normally tested as of june  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit giving rise to the goodwill 
in addition to its annual review  headwaters evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to headwaters business model or changes in headwaters capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from headwaters current estimates 
in those cases where headwaters determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be shortened  headwaters would amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation or amortization expense 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flow from that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a decline in operating performance indicators  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
there were no impairment losses recorded for long lived assets in any of the years presented 
sfas no 
requires headwaters to periodically perform tests for goodwill impairment 
step of the initial impairment test was required to be performed no later than march   thereafter impairment testing is required to be performed no less often than annually  or sooner if evidence of possible impairment arises 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level and headwaters has identified four reporting units i headwaters energy services and ii hti which together comprise the alternative energy segment  iii ccps and iv construction materials 
currently  goodwill exists in the hti  ccps and construction materials reporting units 
step of impairment testing consists of determining and comparing the fair values of the reporting units to the carrying values of those reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on the application of two approaches 
under the first approach  fair value is estimated based on the present value of future estimated cash flows 
this requires significant judgments including the estimation of future sales  profit margins  capital expenditures  future working capital requirements  and the reporting unit s required rate of return 
the second approach estimates fair value based on the quoted market prices of companies reasonably comparable to the reporting unit 
based on the application of these two approaches  an estimate of fair value is determined for each reporting unit 
changes in key estimates and assumptions employed could materially affect the determination of fair value 
if step were to be failed for any of the reporting units  indicating a potential impairment  headwaters would be required to complete step  which is a more detailed test to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill  and compare that value to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is required to be recorded 
headwaters performed step impairment tests of the recorded goodwill in the hti and ccps reporting units as of october   the beginning of fiscal year headwaters performed its annual  recurring tests for potential impairment using the dates of june  and the tests indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values at october   june  and june  accordingly  step of the impairment tests was not required to be performed  and no impairment charge was necessary 
it is possible that some of headwaters tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that the resulting write downs could be material 
legal matters 
headwaters and its subsidiaries are involved in several legal proceedings and contractual matters that have arisen in the normal course of business  all as explained in more detail in item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
headwaters intends to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on headwaters operations  cash flows or financial position 
in headwaters accrued approximately million of reserves for legal matters because it concluded that claims and damages sought by claimants in that amount were probable 
however  these cases raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
headwaters outside counsel believe that unfavorable outcomes are neither probable nor remote and declined to express opinions concerning the likely outcomes or liability of headwaters 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against headwaters in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against it for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
headwaters believes the range of loss is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that headwaters incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time  and other personnel resources and costs in pursuing resolution 
costs paid to outside legal counsel for litigation  which comprise the majority of headwaters litigation related costs  totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in it is not possible to estimate what these costs will be in future periods 
in accounting for legal matters and other contingencies  headwaters follows the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  under which loss contingencies are accounted for based upon the likelihood of an impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability 
if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  it is accrued 
if a loss contingency is probable  but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure is made 
if a loss contingency is reasonably possible  an accrual is made for the most likely amount of loss  if determinable  and disclosure is made of the potential range of loss 
loss contingencies that are remote are neither accounted for nor disclosed 
gain contingencies are given no accounting recognition  but are disclosed if material 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares headwaters operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to million as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales during was due primarily to significantly increased synthetic fuel production by headwaters licensees resulting in increased sales of million  largely offset by decreased synthetic fuel production by customers with which headwaters does not have a license agreement resulting in decreased sales of million 
it is not possible to predict the trend of sales of chemical reagents 
the gross margin percentage for of was approximately the same as for license fees 
during  headwaters recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or over million of license fee revenue recognized during the primary reason for the increase in license fee revenue in compared to was the recognition in march of million of net revenue relating to funds previously deposited in an escrow account by one of headwaters licensees relating to alternative fuel sold prior to december   plus approximately million of net revenue relating to the march  june and september quarters 
for more information about the revenue related to this licensee  see license fee revenue recognition in the critical accounting policies and estimates section above 
ccp revenues 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
ccp revenues for were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in ccp revenues during was due primarily to increased demand for high value ccp products  the acquisition of vfl in april  and the renegotiation of certain service agreements 
the increased demand for high value fly ash products was the result of continued strength in the construction market coupled with a tight market for cement  with cement shortages occurring in some regional markets 
these conditions allowed headwaters to increase prices in certain ccp markets 
vfl s revenues for totaled million 
the gross margin percentage increased from to by approximately due primarily to benefits realized from the renegotiation of the service agreements 
sales of construction materials 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
sales of construction materials during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in sales of construction materials during was due primarily to the acquisitions of eldorado in june  scp in july and tapco in september revenues for these acquired companies for totaled million 
the increase in gross margin percentage from to was due primarily to significantly higher margins from the operations of the acquired businesses  partially offset by certain inventory and other balance sheet adjustments  some of which related to original purchase price allocations  related to the legacy construction materials businesses 
depreciation and amortization 
these costs increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions and the resulting increases in depreciable property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
for this same reason  headwaters expects depreciation and amortization expense to be substantially higher than it was for research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased hti research and development activities and an extra month of hti expenses in headwaters remains committed to hti s research and development efforts and future expenses are likely to outpace levels as a result of continuing efforts to commercialize existing technologies 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to the acquisitions million and increased incentive pay expenses million  along with certain increases in various other costs incidental to growth  primarily payroll related costs 
the increase in incentive pay expenses was the result of obligations under headwaters incentive bonus plans  resulting from improved operating results in  a significant portion of which related to revenue recognized from escrowed funds in march  as previously discussed 
as a result of the acquisitions  selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to be substantially higher than for  but should be more comparable to levels when viewed as a percentage of revenues 
other income and expense 
during  headwaters reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of million in and a net increase in other expenses of million in interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher average levels of long term debt in compared to  primarily related to the acquisitions  and accelerated non cash interest expense related to the substantial increase in debt repayments that were made in compared to in  debt repayments totaled approximately million  which consisted largely of early repayments 
in  debt repayments totaled approximately million 
as a result of the increase in repayments in  non cash interest expense  representing amortization of debt discount and debt issue costs  increased from million in to million in due to the substantially higher amounts of outstanding debt at september  than existed for most of  interest expense in is expected to be substantially higher than for the net change in other expenses of million consisted primarily of a write off of million of deferred acquisition costs related to projects that were abandoned in and an increase of million in losses on disposition of property  plant and equipment in income tax provision 
in  headwaters recorded an income tax provision at an effective tax rate of approximately 
in  the effective tax rate was approximately the same at 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  in september  headwaters purchased a interest in an entity that owns and operates a coal based alternative fuel production facility 
the solid alternative fuel produced at the facility qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  and headwaters is entitled to receive its pro rata share of such tax credits generated 
headwaters has also agreed to purchase an additional interest in the entity upon the earlier of receipt of a private letter ruling for the facility from the irs  or june  at the time headwaters purchases the additional interest  headwaters pro rata share of the tax credits will also increase 
as a result of these tax credits  headwaters expects its effective tax rate to decrease several percentage points in year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares headwaters operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
revenue 
total revenue for increased by million or to million as compared to million for the major components of revenue are discussed in the sections below 
sales of chemical reagents 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
chemical reagent sales during were million with a corresponding direct cost of million 
the increase in chemical reagent sales during was due to increased synthetic fuel production by headwaters licensees approximately million  as well as sales of chemical reagents to new customers with which headwaters does not have a license agreement approximately million 
license fees 
during  headwaters recognized license fee revenue totaling million  an increase of million or over million of license fee revenue recognized during license fees in consisted of recurring license fees or royalty payments of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
license fees in consisted of recurring license fees of million and deferred revenue amortization of million 
the primary reason for the increase in license fee revenue in compared to was a major licensee that purchased four facilities from a former licensee in october  but did not begin operating those facilities until early calendar headwaters earned approximately million in license fees from this licensee in and million in isg revenues and cost of revenues 
ccp revenues and sales of construction materials and the related cost of revenue captions represent isg s revenues and cost of revenues 
because isg was purchased on september   there were only days of operations included in compared to a full year in depreciation and amortization 
these costs increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of isg s tangible and intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of additional costs relating to isg s research and development activities 
in  research and development expenses represented primarily costs related to hti s activities  which remained relatively unchanged during selling  general and administrative expenses 
these expenses increased million to million for from million for the increase in was due primarily to the inclusion of isg s costs  and to a lesser extent  an increase in professional services expenses of approximately million related to legal actions in which headwaters is currently involved 
other income and expense 
during  headwaters reported net other expense of million compared to net other expense of million during the change of million was attributable to i an increase in interest expense of million  ii a decrease in interest income of million  and iii an increase in net losses on notes receivable and investments of million  substantially offset by an increase in net other income of million 
interest expense increased in due to the substantial increase in debt incurred in september to finance the acquisition of isg 
interest expense in includes million related to accelerated amortization of debt discount and debt issue costs associated with million of early repayments of senior debt principal 
interest income decreased from to primarily due to lower average balances of cash and short term investments as a result of headwaters using a substantial amount of cash to purchase isg and applying available cash generated in to repay long term debt 
lower interest rates in also affected interest income 
losses on notes receivable were million higher in as compared to in both years  the majority of the losses represented write downs of a note receivable which is being accounted for on the cost recovery method 
the write downs in both years were necessary due to declines in the value of the underlying collateral 
the carrying value of this note receivable at september  was million 
in  headwaters also recorded a million loss on an investment 
net other income increased by million in compared to primarily due to two non recurring transactions in a million gain on sale of assets resulted from the sale of a interest in one of headwaters original synthetic fuel facilities 
also  headwaters recorded approximately million of losses related to the write off of deferred project financing costs resulting from the abandonment of certain projects or the postponement or redirection of activities for which costs had previously been deferred

headwaters used million of the cash generated from the issuance of common stock to repay debt  and the remaining proceeds were temporarily invested in short term trading investments and ultimately used for acquisitions 
during  a total of million of debt was repaid  approximately million of which was repaid when headwaters refinanced its senior debt in march and again in september new debt issuances in totaled  million net of debt issuance costs of approximately million  and included million of senior debt issued from march through september and million of convertible senior subordinated notes issued in june most of the new debt issuances were in connection with the eldorado acquisition in june and the tapco acquisition in september during  investing activities consisted primarily of net payments for acquisitions totaling million 
more details about headwaters investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  headwaters acquired four companies in the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately million  net of cash acquired of million 
the acquisitions were funded by net cash payments totaling approximately million  along with the assumption of approximately million of debt and the issuance of million of notes payable to the previous owners of one company 
most of the required cash was obtained from the issuance of million of new senior debt in march through september and million of convertible senior subordinated notes in june headwaters intends to continue to expand its business through growth of existing operations  commercialization of technologies currently being developed  and strategic acquisitions of entities that operate in adjacent industries 
it is possible that some portion of cash and cash equivalents and short term trading investments and or proceeds from the issuance of stock or debt will be used to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses in the chemical  energy  building products and related industries 
acquisitions are an important part of headwaters business strategy and to that end  headwaters routinely reviews complementary acquisitions  including those in the areas of ccp marketing  construction materials  and coal and catalyst technologies 
the new senior secured credit agreement limits acquisitions to million each fiscal year  of which cash consideration may not exceed million  unless headwaters total leverage ratio  as defined  is less than or equal to  after giving effect to an acquisition  in which case the foregoing million cash limitation does not apply 
in  headwaters expensed approximately million of deferred acquisition costs related to acquisition projects that were abandoned 
in  payments for the purchase of property  plant and equipment totaled million 
these capital expenditures primarily related to the ccps and construction materials segments 
due to the acquisitions  total capital expenditures for fiscal year will be much higher than for fiscal year  and are currently expected to approximate the limitation on such expenditures included in the senior debt covenants of million 
as of september   headwaters was committed to spend approximately million to complete capital projects that were in various stages of completion 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  in september  headwaters purchased a interest in an entity that owns and operates a coal based alternative fuel production facility 
headwaters minority interest was acquired in exchange for an initial cash payment of million and an obligation to pay million in monthly installments from october through december headwaters has also agreed to purchase an additional interest in the entity upon the earlier of receipt of a private letter ruling for the facility from the irs  or june  at such time  headwaters will be required to make an additional cash payment of million and pay an additional million  plus interest  through december the total amounts that headwaters will be required to pay are directly impacted by the amounts of solid alternative fuel produced at the facility  including the fixed payment obligations of million increasing to million 
in september  headwaters entered into an agreement with an international chemical company  based in germany  to jointly develop and commercialize a process for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide 
under terms of the joint venture agreement  headwaters paid million for its investment in the joint venture and is further obligated to pay an additional million in and million in headwaters has also committed to fund of the joint venture s research and development expenditures  currently limited to euro million approximately million at september   through september although there is no legal obligation to do so  the joint venture partners currently have long range plans to eventually invest in large scale hydrogen peroxide plants using the process for direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide 
headwaters had two notes receivable with a combined carrying value of approximately million at september  in  headwaters wrote off the balance of these notes plus accrued interest because of declines in the value of the underlying collateral that management deemed to be other than temporary 
there are no significant note receivable balances as of september  financing activities 
headwaters has an effective universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec that can be used for the sale of common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt and other securities 
in december  headwaters filed a prospectus supplement to the shelf registration statement and issued million shares of common stock under this shelf registration statement in an underwritten public offering 
in january  an additional million shares of common stock were issued upon exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
in total  proceeds of million were received  net of offering costs of million 
following these issuances of common stock  approximately million remains available for future offerings of securities under the shelf registration statement 
a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any additional securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering would commence under the registration statement 
due to the recent issuance of senior debt and the covenants associated with that debt  as described below  headwaters currently has limited ability to obtain significant additional amounts of long term debt 
new senior secured credit agreements in september and as amended in october  headwaters entered into two credit agreements with a syndication of lenders under which a total of million was borrowed under term loan arrangements and which provide for million to be borrowed under a revolving credit arrangement 
the proceeds were used to acquire tapco and repay in full the remaining balance due under headwaters former senior secured credit agreement obtained in march see below 
the million of term loan borrowings consisted of a first lien term loan in the amount of million and a second lien term loan in the amount of million 
both term loans are secured by all assets of headwaters and are senior in priority to all other debt 
the first lien term loan bears interest  at headwaters option  at either i the london interbank offered rate libor plus  if the total leverage ratio  as defined  is less than or equal to  and if not  at libor plus  or ii the base rate plus  if the total leverage ratio is less than or equal to  and if not  at the base rate plus 
base rate is defined as the higher of the rate announced by morgan stanley senior funding and the overnight rate charged by the federal reserve bank of new york plus 
the initial interest rate on the first lien debt was set at  but was subsequently reduced to approximately in october pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
the second lien term loan bears interest  also at headwaters option  at either libor plus  or the base rate plus 
the initial interest rate on the second lien debt was set at  but was subsequently reduced to approximately in october pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
headwaters can lock in new rates for both the first lien and second lien loans for one  two  three or six months 
the next rate change will occur in january the first lien term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of principal and interest  with minimum required quarterly principal repayments of million commencing in november through august  then million through august  with three repayments of approximately million through april  the termination date of the first lien loan agreement 
the second lien term loan is due september  with no required principal repayments prior to that time 
interest is generally due on a quarterly basis 
there are mandatory prepayments of the first lien term loan in the event of certain asset sales and debt and equity issuances and from excess cash flow  as defined 
optional prepayments of the first lien term loan are permitted without penalty or premium 
optional prepayments of the second lien term loan are permissible only to the extent headwaters issues new equity securities and then are further limited to a maximum of million  so long as the first lien term loan remains outstanding 
any optional prepayments of the second lien term loan bear a penalty of of prepayments made in the first year  of prepayments made in the second year  and of prepayments made in the third year 
once repaid in full or in part  no further reborrowings under either of the term loan arrangements can be made 
in october  headwaters repaid a total of million of the first lien term loan  which amount otherwise would have been due in november and february as required by the new senior secured credit facility  headwaters entered into certain other agreements to limit its exposure to interest rate increases 
the first set of agreements established the maximum libor rate for million of the senior secured debt at through september  the second set of agreements sets the libor rate at for million of this debt for the period commencing september  through september  headwaters accounts for these agreements as cash flow hedges  and accordingly  the fair market value of the hedges is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as either other assets or other liabilities 
the hedges had a fair market value of at september  former senior secured credit agreement in march  headwaters entered into a credit agreement with a group of banks under which a total of million was borrowed under a term loan arrangement and which  as amended in june  provided for an additional million to be borrowed under a revolving credit arrangement 
the initial million of proceeds were used to repay in full the remaining balance due under headwaters former senior secured credit agreement see below 
debt issuance costs of approximately million were incurred in issuing this debt  all of which was expensed in the term loan was secured by all assets of headwaters  bore interest at a variable rate linked to the eurodollar rate or the lenders base rate  both as defined in the agreement  and was repayable in quarterly installments of million through september  with a final payment of million due november in connection with the purchase of eldorado in june  a total of million was borrowed under the revolving credit arrangement  all of which was repaid in june in connection with the purchase of scp in july  a total of million was borrowed under the revolving credit arrangement  all of which was repaid in september also in september  the remaining balance outstanding under the term loan was repaid in full using proceeds from the new senior secured credit facility described above 
convertible senior subordinated notes in connection with the eldorado acquisition  headwaters issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due these notes are subordinate to the new senior secured debt described above 
holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of headwaters common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount conversion price  or approximately million aggregate shares of common stock  contingent upon certain events 
the conversion rate adjusts for events related to headwaters common stock  including common stock issued as a dividend  rights or warrants to purchase common stock issued to all holders of headwaters common stock  and other similar rights or events that apply to all holders of common stock 
the notes are convertible if any of the following five criteria are met satisfaction of a market price condition which becomes operative if the common stock trading price reaches per share for a certain period of time prior to june  and at any time after that date  a credit rating  if any  assigned to the notes is three or more rating subcategories below the initial rating  if any  the notes trade at of the product of the common stock trading price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  except this provision is not available if the closing common stock price is between and of the current conversion price of the notes  headwaters calls the notes for redemption  and certain corporate transactions occur  including distribution of rights or warrants to all common stockholders entitling them to purchase common stock at less than the current market price or distribution of common stock  cash or other assets  debt securities or certain rights to purchase securities where the distribution has a per share value exceeding of the closing common stock price on the day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution 
in addition  the notes are convertible if headwaters enters into an agreement pursuant to which headwaters common stock would be converted into cash  securities or other property 
headwaters may call the notes for redemption at any time on or after june  and prior to june  if the closing common stock price exceeds of the conversion price for trading days in any consecutive day trading period in which case headwaters must provide a make whole payment of the present value of all remaining interest payments on the redeemed notes through june  
in addition  the holder of the notes has the right to require headwaters to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on june  or if a fundamental change in common stock has occurred  including termination of trading 
subsequent to june   the notes require an additional interest payment equal to of the average trading price of the notes if the trading price equals or more of the principal amount of the notes 
headwaters has not included the additional shares of common stock contingently issuable under the notes in its diluted eps as none of the contingencies have been met 
however  as explained in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the risks relating to headwaters business section of this item  implementation of eitf in december will require headwaters to include in its diluted eps calculation  on an if converted basis  the additional shares issuable under the notes 
former senior secured credit agreement in connection with the isg acquisition in  headwaters entered into a million senior secured credit agreement with a syndication of lenders  under which a total of million was borrowed as a term loan on the acquisition date 
the credit agreement also allowed up to million to be borrowed under a revolving credit arrangement 
the debt was issued at a discount and headwaters received net cash proceeds of million 
the original issue discount was accreted using the effective interest method and the accretion was recorded as interest expense 
the debt was secured by all assets of headwaters  bore interest at a variable rate linked to the eurodollar rate or the lenders base rate  both as defined in the agreement approximately at september  and was repayable in quarterly installments through august  during the december quarter  principal repayments totaling million were made  including million of optional prepayments 
during the march quarter  the remaining balance was repaid in full using available cash and million of proceeds from the former senior secured credit facility described above 
in connection with the full repayment of this debt  non cash interest expense totaling approximately million was recognized in the march quarter  representing amortization of all of the remaining debt discount and debt issue costs related to this debt 
senior subordinated debentures in connection with the isg acquisition  headwaters also entered into a million subordinated loan agreement  under which senior subordinated debentures were issued at a discount  with headwaters receiving net cash proceeds of million 
the original issue discount was accreted using the effective interest method and the accretion was recorded as interest expense 
isg management participated in one half  or million  of the million of debt issued 
the other half was issued to a corporation 
the debentures bore interest at and were due in  however  in december  the debentures were repaid in full  including a  or million  prepayment charge paid to the corporation holding million of the debentures 
this charge  along with all remaining unamortized debt discount and debt issue costs  is included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of income 
notes payable to a bank in connection with the acquisition of scp  headwaters assumed scp s obligations under its notes payable to a bank 
the notes require monthly interest and quarterly principal payments and are repayable from april through april two of the notes bear interest at libor plus  subject to an interest rate floor of at september   and the remaining note in the amount of million bears interest at below the bank s base rate at september  
because the notes are callable by the bank  headwaters has included the outstanding balance in current portion of long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet 
the notes are collateralized by certain assets of scp and contain financial covenants  the most restrictive of which specifies a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
headwaters was in compliance with all debt covenants at september  notes payable to former vfl stockholders in connection with the vfl acquisition  headwaters issued million of notes payable to the vfl stockholders  million of which was repaid in june and million of which was repaid in july the interest rate on million of the notes was and the interest rate on the remaining million of notes was variable 
short term borrowings with an investment bank headwaters had an arrangement with an investment bank under which headwaters could borrow up to of the value of the portfolio of headwaters short term investments with the investment bank  limited to a maximum amount of million 
headwaters borrowed million under this arrangement during june  all of which was repaid in june in july  headwaters borrowed million under this arrangement  all of which was repaid in july this arrangement is no longer active 
options  warrants  and employee stock purchases in  cash proceeds from the exercise of options  warrants and employee stock purchases totaled million  compared to million in option exercise activity is largely dependent on headwaters stock price and is not predictable 
to the extent non qualified stock options are exercised  or there are disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of incentive stock options  headwaters receives an income tax deduction generally equal to the income recognized by the optionee 
such amounts  reflected in cash flows from operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows  were million in and million in these income tax deductions do not affect income tax expense or the effective income tax rate  rather they are reflected as increases in capital in excess of par value in the consolidated balance sheet 
working capital 
in  headwaters working capital increased by million  to million as of september  several of the significant changes in the components of working capital were the result of the acquisitions  most notably the eldorado and tapco acquisitions 
headwaters expects operations to produce positive cash flows in future periods  which  when combined with current working capital  is expected to be sufficient for operating needs for long term debt 
due to the recent issuance of senior debt and the covenants associated with that debt  as described below  headwaters currently has limited ability to obtain significant additional amounts of long term debt 
however  as provided for in the new senior debt agreements  headwaters has available million under a revolving credit arrangement 
borrowings under this arrangement are generally subject to the terms of the first lien loan agreement and bear interest at either libor plus to  or the base rate plus to 
borrowings and reborrowings of any available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through september  at which time all loans must be repaid and the revolving credit arrangement terminates 
the fees for the unused portion of the revolving credit arrangement range from to 
finally  the credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the revolving credit arrangement 
as of september   three letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  with expiration dates ranging from october to june headwaters may  in the future  make optional prepayments of the senior debt depending on actual cash flows  headwaters current and expected cash requirements and other factors deemed significant by management 
the senior debt agreements contain restrictions and covenants common to such agreements  including limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  investments  merger and acquisition activity  asset sales and liens  capital expenditures in excess of million in any fiscal year increasing to million in and the payment of dividends  among others 
in addition  headwaters must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  as those terms are defined in the agreements 
under the most restrictive covenants  contained in the first lien agreement  headwaters must maintain a total leverage ratio of or less  declining periodically to in  a maximum ratio of consolidated senior funded indebtedness minus subordinated indebtedness to ebitda of  declining periodically to in  and a minimum ratio of ebitda plus rent payments for the four preceding fiscal quarters to scheduled payments of principal and interest on all indebtedness for the next four fiscal quarters of through september   and thereafter 
headwaters is in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  as described above  headwaters has approximately million of variable rate long term debt outstanding as of september   consisting of million of senior debt and million of notes payable to a bank 
a change in the interest rate of would change headwaters interest expense by approximately million during the year ending september   considering all outstanding balances of variable rate debt and required principal repayments 
income taxes 
as discussed previously  cash payments for income taxes are reduced for disqualifying dispositions of shares obtained upon the exercise of stock options  which totaled million in headwaters cash requirements for income taxes in are expected to approximate the income tax provision  with some lag due to the seasonality of operations and because estimated income tax payments are typically based on annualizing the fiscal year s income based on year to date results 
in  headwaters recorded an income tax provision at an effective tax rate of approximately 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  in september  headwaters purchased a interest in an entity that owns and operates a coal based alternative fuel production facility 
the synthetic fuel produced at the facility qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  and headwaters is entitled to receive its pro rata share of such tax credits generated 
headwaters has also agreed to purchase an additional interest in the entity upon the earlier of receipt of a private letter ruling for the facility from the irs  or june  at the time headwaters purchases the additional interest  headwaters pro rata share of the tax credits will also increase 
as a result of these tax credits  headwaters expects its effective tax rate to decrease several percentage points in summary of future cash requirements 
significant future cash needs  in addition to operational working capital requirements  are currently expected to consist primarily of debt service payments on outstanding long term debt  income taxes and capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements although headwaters has operating leases for certain equipment and real estate  and hedge agreements to limit its exposure to interest rate increases  headwaters does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table presents a summary of headwaters contractual obligations by period as of september  payments due by period after in millions total year years years years senior secured debt convertible senior subordinated notes other long term debt total long term debt unconditional purchase obligations operating lease obligations investment and joint venture obligations capital expenditures other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations  as provided for in the senior debt agreements  headwaters has available million under a revolving credit arrangement 
borrowings and reborrowings of any available portion of the million revolver can be made at any time through september  at which time all loans must be repaid and the revolving credit arrangement terminates 
the credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit  provided there is capacity under the revolving credit arrangement 
as of september   three letters of credit totaling million were outstanding  with expiration dates ranging from october to june there have been no other letters of credit issued and no funds have been borrowed under the revolving credit arrangement 
as indicated previously  headwaters and its subsidiaries are involved in several legal proceedings and contractual matters that have arisen in the normal course of business  all as explained in more detail in critical accounting policies and estimates legal matters  above  item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
section matters headwaters energy services license fees and revenues from sales of chemical reagents depend on the ability of licensees and customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuels that generate tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
from time to time  issues arise as to the availability of tax credits  including the items discussed below 
because of the inherent risks associated with headwaters reliance on section  headwaters has sought to diversify its sources of revenue  largely through acquisitions  as described previously 
legislation 
under current law  section tax credits for synthetic fuel produced from coal expire on december  in addition  there have been initiatives from time to time to consider the early repeal or modification of section for example  during  a bill was introduced in the united states house of representatives that would repeal the section credit for synthetic fuel produced from coal 
although it is unlikely that the bill will pass congress in  the bill could be reintroduced in if section expires at the end of or if it is repealed or adversely modified  synthetic fuel facilities would probably either close or substantially curtail production 
at this time  given current prices of coal and costs of synthetic fuel production  headwaters does not believe that production of synthetic fuel will be profitable absent the tax credits 
in addition  if headwaters licensees close their facilities or materially reduce production activities whether after  upon earlier repeal or adverse modification of section or for any other reason  it would have a material adverse effect on the revenues and net income of headwaters 
phase out 
section tax credits are subject to phase out after the average annual wellhead domestic oil price reference price reaches a beginning phase out threshold price  and is eliminated entirely if the reference price reaches the full phase out price 
for  the reference price was per barrel and the phase out range began at and would have fully phased out tax credits at per barrel 
for  an estimated partial year reference price through september is per barrel  and an estimate of the phase out range using inflation begins at and completes phase out at per barrel 
the nymex one day futures trading price on december  was per barrel 
irs audits 
licensees are subject to audit by the irs 
the irs may challenge whether headwaters energy services licensees satisfy the requirements of section  or applicable private letter rulings  including placed in service requirements  or may attempt to disallow section tax credits for some other reason 
the irs has initiated audits of certain licensee taxpayers who claimed section tax credits  and the outcome of any such audit is uncertain 
in  a licensee announced that irs field auditors had issued a notice of proposed adjustment challenging the placed in service date of three of its synthetic fuel facilities 
the licensee believes that the facilities meet the placed in service requirement  however  the matter is at an early stage and the timing and final results of the audit are unknown 
the inability of a licensee to claim section tax credits would reduce headwaters future income from the licensee 
senate permanent subcommittee on investigations 
on october   the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the government affairs committee of the united states senate issued a notification of pending investigations 
the notification listed the synthetic fuel tax credit as a new item 
in march  the subcommittee described its investigation as follows the subcommittee is continuing its investigation 
of 
tax credits claimed under section of the internal revenue code for the sale of coal based synthetic fuels 
this investigation is examining the utilization of these tax credits  the nature of the technologies and fuels created  the use of these fuels  and other aspects of section the investigation will also address the irs administration of section tax credits 
the subcommittee conducted numerous interviews and received large volumes of data between december and march since that time  to headwaters knowledge  there has been little activity regarding the investigation 
headwaters cannot make any assurances as to the timing or ultimate outcome of the subcommittee investigation  nor can headwaters predict whether congress or others may conduct investigations of section tax credits in the future 
the subcommittee investigation may have a material adverse effect on the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions to purchase synthetic fuel facilities or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities  and may materially adversely affect headwaters revenues and net income 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus requiring the inclusion of contingently convertible instruments in diluted eps calculations 
this consensus eitf issue  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share will be effective for periods ending after december  and will require headwaters to include in its diluted eps calculation  on an if converted basis  the additional shares issuable under the terms of headwaters outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes described in note the eitf consensus  when implemented  must be applied to all applicable prior periods  which for headwaters will be the quarters ended june  and september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the expected effect on headwaters eps of implementing the eitf consensus 
headwaters has reviewed all other recently issued accounting standards  which have not yet been adopted in order to determine their potential effect  if any  on the results of operations or financial position of headwaters 
based on that review  headwaters does not currently believe that any of these recent accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on its current or future financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosures 
impact of inflation headwaters operations were not materially impacted by inflation in risks relating to headwaters business if the continued existence of tax credits under section of the internal revenue code section is repealed or adversely modified  headwaters energy services profitability will be severely affected 
headwaters energy services license fees and revenues from sales of chemical reagents depend on the ability of its licensees and customers to manufacture and sell qualified synthetic fuels that generate tax credits 
under current law  section tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel sold after december  in addition  there have been initiatives from time to time to consider the early repeal or modification of section for example  in a bill was introduced in the united states house of representatives that would repeal the section credit for synthetic fuel produced from coal 
while passage of the bill appears to be unlikely  the bill could be reintroduced in congress in the future 
if section expires at the end of or if it is repealed or adversely modified  synthetic fuel facilities would probably either close or substantially curtail production 
at this time  given current prices of coal and costs of synthetic fuel production  headwaters does not believe that production of synthetic fuel will be profitable absent the tax credits 
in addition  if headwaters licensees close their facilities or materially reduce production activities whether after  upon earlier repeal or adverse modification of section or for any other reason  it would have a material adverse effect on the revenues and net income of headwaters 
furthermore  section tax credits are subject to begin phase out after the unregulated average annual oil price reaches per barrel  adjusted annually for inflation the one day futures trading price on december  was per barrel 
if headwaters licensees demand for section tax credits decreases  headwaters energy services revenues will decrease 
headwaters energy services business depends upon the ability of its licensees and chemical reagent customers to utilize section tax credits as payments under its contracts are ultimately based on its customers production of synthetic fuels 
their ability to utilize tax credits depends upon their taxable income 
a decline in the profitability of its licensees could reduce their ability to utilize tax credits  and  in turn  could lead to a reduction in the production of synthetic fuel at their facilities 
such licensees could sell their facilities to a taxpayer with more capacity to utilize the tax credits  but any such transfer could result in short term or long term disruption of operations  and therefore adversely affect headwaters revenues and net income 
irs reviews under section may adversely affect headwaters licensees production of synthetic fuel and therefore may adversely affect headwaters energy services profitability 
the issuance of private letter rulings plrs under section by the internal revenue service irs is important to the willingness of the owners of synthetic fuel facilities to operate and to their ability to transfer ownership of those facilities 
however  plrs may be modified or revoked by the irs 
the irs has suspended the issuance of plrs to synthetic fuel facility owners several times in the past  including most recently in  and the irs may suspend the issuance of plrs in the future 
in  following an irs announcement that it would suspend issuance of plrs because it questioned the scientific validity of procedures and tests performed by synthetic fuel facility operators to determine that the fuel satisfied the requirements of section  certain of headwaters licensees reduced or ceased production  which resulted in a material impact on headwaters revenue and net income 
while the irs later indicated it would resume the issuance of plrs  it has continued to express concerns regarding the sampling and data record retention practices prevalent in the synthetic fuels industry 
the expression of irs concern regarding current practices in the industry may adversely affect the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities 
if current owners are unable to sell their facilities or are unwilling to operate them  production will not be maximized  thereby materially decreasing its revenues and net income 
headwaters cannot predict whether the irs may conduct reviews or investigations of section tax credits in the future  or whether the outcome of irs audits involving licensees would be favorable 
senate investigation of section tax credits may adversely affect production by headwaters licensees and decrease the profitability of headwaters energy services 
on october   the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the government affairs committee of the united states senate the subcommittee issued a notification of pending investigations 
the notification listed  among others  the synthetic fuel tax credit as a new item to be reviewed 
if the pending investigation or any future congressional action results in findings or announcements negative to the industry  it may adversely affect the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions to purchase synthetic fuel facilities or the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities  which would have a direct  negative impact on headwaters revenues and net income 
in march  the subcommittee described its investigation as follows the subcommittee is continuing its investigation 
of 
tax credits claimed under section of the internal revenue code for the sale of coal based synthetic fuels 
this investigation is examining the utilization of these tax credits  the nature of the technologies and fuels created  the use of these fuels  and others 
sic 
aspects of section the investigation will also address the irs administration of section tax credits 
the subcommittee conducted numerous interviews and received large volumes of data between december and march since that time  to headwaters knowledge  there has been little activity regarding the investigation 
if the irs challenges or disallows section tax credits claimed by its licensees  headwaters energy services profitability may decrease because future production by these licensees may decrease 
licensees are subject to audit by the irs 
the irs may challenge whether headwaters energy services licensees satisfy the requirements of section  or applicable plrs  including placed in service requirements  or may attempt to disallow section tax credits for some other reason 
the irs has initiated audits of certain licensee taxpayers who claimed section tax credits  and the outcome of any such audit is uncertain 
in  a licensee announced that irs field auditors have issued a notice of proposed adjustment challenging the placed in service date of three of its synthetic fuel facilities 
the licensee believes that the facilities meet the placed in service requirement  however  the timing and final results of the audit are unknown 
in the event that tax credits are disallowed  licensees may seek recovery from headwaters energy services for operational or other reasons  although headwaters believes there would be no basis for such claims 
the inability of a licensee to claim section tax credits also would reduce headwaters energy services future revenue from the licensee 
in addition  irs audit activity may have adversely affected the willingness of buyers to engage in transactions to purchase synthetic fuel facilities or on the willingness of current owners to operate their facilities 
if current owners are unable to sell their facilities or are unwilling to operate them at full capacity  production will not be maximized  which could have a significant effect on headwaters energy services revenues and net income 
if headwaters energy services licensees demand for section tax credits is adversely influenced by negative publicity involving the industry or transactions principally motivated by the reduction of taxes  headwaters energy services profitability will decrease 
there has been public scrutiny  by the media and by policymakers  of section outside the section context  there has been increased public scrutiny of transactions motivated principally by the reduction of federal income taxes 
headwaters energy services licensees could determine that the risk of negative publicity or public scrutiny associated with the section tax credits exceeds the financial benefits from the utilization of the credits 
such licensees may seek to mitigate or eliminate such risk by reducing or ceasing production of synthetic fuel or disposing of their facilities  resulting in short term or long term disruption of operations  in which case headwaters energy services revenues and profitability would decrease 
headwaters energy services revenues result from a small number of licensees and customers  so that any short term or long term decisions by one or a small number of licensees and customers to decrease or halt production would cause its profitability to decrease 
headwaters energy services has licensed its coal based solid alternative fuel technology to approximately licensees  from whom license fees accounted for approximately of headwaters aggregate revenues on an actual basis for fiscal in addition  hes sells reagent to approximately licensees and additional customers from which reagent sales accounted for approximately of its aggregate revenues in under current law  facilities must have been placed into service prior to july  to be eligible for section tax credits  so headwaters energy services business primarily depends on existing licensees and chemical reagent customers 
if any of headwaters energy services significant licensees or chemical reagent customers shuts down its facilities  operates its facilities at low production levels or sells its facilities resulting in short term or long term disruption of operations  headwaters revenues and net income could be materially adversely affected 
headwaters energy services licensees must address all operational issues including  but not limited to  feedstock availability  cost  moisture content  british thermal unit content  correct chemical reagent formulation and application  operability of equipment  product durability and overall costs of operations 
in some cases  licensees may be forced to relocate plants and enter into new strategic contracts to address marketing and operational issues 
licensee plant relocations disrupt production and delay generation of license fees paid to headwaters 
the growth of headwaters energy services revenues has depended in part on increased production over time of coal based solid synthetic fuel by its licensees 
while to date efficiencies in production and improvements in equipment and processes used at facilities have allowed increased production  capacity is ultimately finite for the specific facilities and could ultimately limit future growth 
if headwaters energy services is not able to develop and improve alternative fuel technologies in order to satisfy its customers requirements  headwaters may lose customers and associated licensing and chemical reagent revenues 
for headwaters energy services to remain competitive  hes must be able to develop or refine its technologies to keep up with future alternative fuel requirements 
as licensees develop and modify their operations and choices of coal feedstocks  hes will need to modify existing methods or find new methods  know how  additives and other techniques to meet licensee and customer demands  such as demands for improved efficiencies  lower costs and improvements in alternative fuel products  including chemical change and improved combustion characteristics 
if headwaters is unable to develop or refine hes technologies  its customers may seek other suppliers or decrease production  thus adversely affecting licensing and chemical reagent revenues 
headwaters resources primarily sells fly ash for use in concrete  if use and market acceptance of fly ash does not increase  headwaters resources will not grow 
headwaters resources growth has been and continues to be dependent upon the increased use of fly ash in the production of concrete 
headwaters resources marketing initiatives emphasize the environmental  cost and performance advantages of replacing portland cement with fly ash in the production of concrete 
if headwaters resources marketing initiatives are not successful  headwaters resources may not be able to sustain its growth 
if portland cement or competing replacement products are available at lower prices than fly ash  headwaters sales of fly ash as a replacement for portland cement in concrete products could suffer  causing a decline in headwaters resources revenues and net income 
an estimated of headwaters resources revenues for the fiscal year ended september   which represents of headwaters aggregate revenues for the year  were derived from the use of fly ash as a replacement for portland cement in concrete products 
at times  there may be an overcapacity of cement in the world market  causing potential price decreases 
the markets for headwaters resources products are regional  in part because of the costs of transporting ccps  and because headwaters resources business is affected by the availability and cost of competing products in the specific regions where it conducts business 
if competing products become available at attractive prices and performance  headwaters resources revenues and net income could decrease 
because demand for ccps sold by headwaters resources is affected by fluctuations in weather and construction cycles  headwaters resources revenues and net income could decrease significantly as a result of unexpected or severe weather or slowdowns in the construction industry 
headwaters resources manages and markets ccps and uses ccps to produce construction materials 
utilities produce ccps year round 
in comparison  sales of ccps are generally keyed to construction market demands that tend to follow national trends in construction with predictable increases during temperate seasons 
headwaters resources ccp sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends  with the largest percentage of total annual revenues being realized in the quarters ended june and september low seasonal demand normally results in reduced shipments and revenues in the quarters ended march and december the ccp industry is cyclical because of its dependence on building construction and highway construction  including infrastructure repair  and is affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
state construction budgets are affected adversely by economic downturns 
headwaters resources sales could significantly decrease as a result of a downturn in the economy in one or more markets that it serves 
if headwaters resources coal fueled electric utility industry suppliers fail to provide headwaters resources with high value ccps on a timely basis  headwaters resources costs could increase and its growth could be hindered 
headwaters resources relies on the production of ccps by coal fueled electric utilities 
headwaters resources has occasionally experienced delays and other problems in obtaining high value ccps from its suppliers and may in the future be unable to obtain high value ccps on the scale and within the time frames required by headwaters resources to meet its customers needs 
if headwaters resources is unable to obtain ccps or if it experiences a delay in the delivery of high value ccps  headwaters resources may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative sources or to otherwise maintain supply to its customers 
moreover  its revenues could be adversely affected if these customers choose to find alternatives to headwaters resources products 
with headwaters recent acquisitions of eldorado and tapco  headwaters construction materials has grown to be a significant part of headwaters business and headwaters future profitability is therefore increasingly dependent upon headwaters operations in this industry segment 
in june headwaters acquired eldorado and in september it acquired tapco 
with the eldorado and tapco acquisitions  headwaters construction materials has grown to be a significant part of headwaters business 
this segment produced million in revenues or approximately of total revenue for fiscal year  in combination with tapco and eldorado  on a pro forma basis  revenues for this segment would have been million or approximately of total pro forma revenues for fiscal year headwaters future profitability therefore is highly dependent upon its ability to operate successfully in this industry segment where its operations to date have not been as significant to its total revenues 
if headwaters does not successfully integrate eldorado and tapco with its existing business  headwaters may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions  and the resources and attention required for successful integration may interrupt the business activities of eldorado  tapco and headwaters existing business 
there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating eldorado and tapco  even though other senior management continues to operate the businesses 
these difficulties include integrating eldorado and tapco with headwaters existing construction materials business  while maintaining the ongoing operations of each business  coordinating geographically separate organizations and developing new customers and products 
successful integration will also depend in part on headwaters ability to retain key officers and personnel in each of headwaters business units 
the combination with headwaters has resulted in the combined company having more than  employees  which substantially increased headwaters previous workforce of approximately  employees 
integration of these additional employees  many of whom are manufacturing plant workers  could result in various issues  including issues related to human resource benefit plans and an increase in eeoc claims and claims for workers compensation 
as headwaters integrates tapco s and eldorado s manufacturing and distribution activities  headwaters also has increased significantly its sales and products 
headwaters has limited manufacturing experience and may not be able to resolve manufacturing issues or increase efficiencies at manufacturing plants 
the integration process requires headwaters to expand significantly its operational and financial systems  which increases the operating complexity of its information technology systems 
implementation of controls  systems and procedures may be costly and time consuming and may not be effective 
if headwaters cannot invest additional capital into tapco and eldorado  it may not be able to sustain or continue tapco s and eldorado s growth 
current levels of capital expenditures may be insufficient to support and sustain tapco s and eldorado s growth 
headwaters believes that an estimated million of capital in its fiscal year will be required for company wide growth and other purposes 
headwaters senior secured credit facilities limit capital expenditures for the entire business to million for fiscal year because tapco s and eldorado s markets are heavily dependent on the residential construction and remodeling market  tapco s and eldorado s revenues could decrease as a result of declines in construction and remodeling activity due to unexpected or severe weather  a rise in interest rates  a limit on availability of credit for homeowners or other events outside headwaters control that impact home construction and home improvement activity 
tapco s and eldorado s construction markets are seasonal and cyclical 
the majority of their sales are in the residential construction market  which tends to slow down in the winter months 
if there is more severe weather than normal or an increase in interest rates or a limit on availability of credit for homeowners which results in a slow down in new construction or remodeling and repair activities  there may be a negative effect on tapco s and eldorado s revenues if they are not able to increase market share 
interruption of tapco s ability to immediately ship individual or custom product orders could harm tapco s reputation and result in lost revenues if customers turn to other sources for products 
tapco s construction materials business is highly dependent upon immediate shipments to contractors and distributors throughout the united states of individual orders  a large portion of which orders are manufactured upon demand to meet customer specifications 
if there is significant interruption of business at any of tapco s manufacturing plants or with tapco s computer systems that track customer orders and production  tapco is at risk of harming its reputation for speed and reliability with important customers and losing short term and long term revenues if these customers turn to other sources 
a significant increase in the price of materials used in the production of tapco s products that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on net revenue 
further  tapco depends upon a single source for a major production material  the interruption of which would materially disrupt headwaters ability to manufacture products and supply products to its customers  resulting in lost revenues and the potential loss of customers 
certain of tapco s products  which provided approximately of tapco s revenues for the fiscal year ended october   are manufactured from polypropylene which material is sold to tapco by a single supplier 
the price of polypropylene is primarily a function of manufacturing capacity  demand and the prices of petrochemical feedstocks  crude oil and natural gas liquids 
historically  the market price of polypropylene has fluctuated 
a significant increase in the price of polypropylene that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on net revenue 
there is no long term contract with headwaters polypropylene supplier 
tapco does not currently maintain large inventories of polypropylene and alternative sources meeting tapco s requirements would be difficult to arrange in the short term 
therefore  tapco s manufacturing and ability to provide products to headwaters customers could be materially disrupted if this supply of polypropylene was interrupted for any reason 
such an interruption and the resulting inability to supply tapco s customers with products could adversely impact tapco s revenues and potentially headwaters relationships with tapco s customers 
tapco s revenues would be materially adversely affected if it lost one or both of its two major customers 
two of tapco s customers together accounted for approximately of its revenues in its fiscal year ended october  there are no long term contracts in place with these customers 
accordingly  any loss of or decrease in demand from these customers would have a material adverse effect on tapco s business 
hti s technologies may not be commercially developed and marketed profitably  which could affect hti s future profitability 
although hti has developed and patented several technologies  commercialization of these technologies is in initial stages 
market acceptance of these technologies will depend on hti s ability to enter into agreements with licensees or joint venturers to further develop and provide adequate funding to commercialize the technologies 
hti may not be able to enter into these agreements and adequate funding may not be available to fully develop and successfully commercialize its technologies 
further  headwaters may not be able to market profitably hti s technologies 
hti will conduct business in china  where intellectual property and other laws  as well as business conditions  may leave headwaters intellectual property  products and technologies vulnerable to duplication by competitors and create uncertainties as to headwaters legal rights against such competitors actions 
hti has and is expected to continue to license or otherwise make its technology  including its nanotechnology and coal liquefaction technology  available to entities in china 
hti is also performing a feasibility study that could lead to licensing of technology in india 
there is the risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect headwaters intellectual property to the same extent as under united states laws  leaving us vulnerable to competitors who may attempt to copy headwaters products  processes or technologies 
further  the legal system of china is based on statutory law 
under this system  prior court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority but do not have binding precedential effect 
since  the chinese government has been developing a comprehensive system of commercial laws and considerable progress has been made in the promulgation of laws and regulations dealing with economic matters  such as corporate organization and governance  foreign investment  commerce  taxation and trade 
as these laws  regulations and legal requirements are relatively new and because of the limited volume of published case law and judicial interpretations and the non binding nature of prior court decisions  the interpretation and enforcement of these laws  regulations and legal requirements involve some uncertainty 
these uncertainties could limit the legal protection or recourse available to headwaters 
in addition  dependence on foreign licenses and conducting foreign operations may subject headwaters to increased risk from political change  ownership issues or repatriation or currency exchange concerns 
headwaters operates in industries subject to significant environmental regulation  and compliance with and changes in regulation could add significantly to the costs of conducting business 
the coal based solid synthetic fuel operations of headwaters and its licensees are subject to federal  state and local environmental regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of waste products  which add to the costs of doing business and expose headwaters to potential fines for non compliance 
if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason  headwaters may not be able to pass on these costs to customers 
in order to establish and operate the synthetic fuel plants  power plants and operations to collect and transport ccps and bottom ash  headwaters  its licensees and customers have obtained various state and local permits and must comply with processes and procedures that have been approved by regulatory authorities 
any failure to comply could result in the issuance of substantial fines and penalties and cause headwaters to incur environmental liabilities 
certain eldorado and tapco manufacturing operations are also subject to environmental regulations and permit requirements 
if eldorado and tapco cannot obtain additional required environmental permits for their manufacturing facilities in a timely manner or at all  they may be subject to additional costs and or fines 
hti s ordinary course of business requires using its facilities to perform research and development activities involving coal  oil  chemicals and energy technologies  including liquefaction of coal 
as a result  petroleum and other hazardous materials have been and are present in and on hti s properties 
regulatory noncompliance or accidental discharges  in spite of safeguards  could create an environmental liability 
therefore headwaters operations entail risk of environmental damage  and headwaters could incur liabilities in the future arising from the discharge of pollutants into the environment or from waste disposal practices 
headwaters is involved in litigation and claims for which headwaters incurs significant costs and are exposed to significant liability 
headwaters is a party to some significant legal proceedings and is subject to potential claims regarding operation of its business 
these proceedings will require that headwaters incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources and costs in pursuing resolution  and adverse resolution of these proceedings could hurt headwaters reputation 
with respect to the cases referred to in our item legal proceedings of this form k  the following amount of damages are being sought by the counter parties boynton boynton seeks declaratory relief as well as approximate compensatory damages between million and million and punitive damages  agtc agtc claims approximate damages between  and million  ajg ajg seeks compensatory damages in the approximate amount of million and punitive damages  mcewan mcewan seeks declaratory relief as well as compensatory damages in the approximate amount of million and punitive damages 
headwaters has ongoing litigation and claims incurred during the normal course of business  including the items referred to above 
headwaters intends to vigorously defend and or pursue its rights in these actions 
headwaters does not currently believe that the outcome of these actions will have a material adverse effect on headwaters operations  cash flows or financial position  however  it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the change could be significant 
headwaters has significant competition in its industries which may cause demand for headwaters products and services to decrease 
headwaters experiences significant competition in all of its segments and geographic regions 
a failure to compete effectively or increased competition could lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  which could hurt profitability 
many of headwaters competitors have greater financial  management and other resources than headwaters and may be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily 
in certain instances headwaters must compete on the basis of superior products and services rather than price  thereby increasing the costs of marketing its services to remain competitive 
headwaters energy services competes with other companies possessing technologies to produce coal based solid alternative fuels and companies that produce chemical reagents 
it also experiences competition from traditional coal and fuel suppliers and companies involved with natural resources  in addition to those companies that specialize in the use and upgrading of industrial byproducts 
these companies may have greater financial  management and other resources than headwaters has and may develop superior  or more cost effective technologies 
this could result in a decrease in market share and therefore revenues 
headwaters resources has substantial competition in two main areas obtaining ccp management contracts with utility and other industrial companies  and marketing ccps and related industrial materials 
there are many local  regional and national companies that compete for market share in these areas with similar products and with numerous other substitute products 
although headwaters resources typically has long term ccp management contracts with its clients  some of such contracts provide for the termination of such contracts at the convenience of the utility company upon a minimum day notice 
moreover  certain of headwaters resources most significant regional ccp competitors appear to be seeking a broader national presence  and some of these competitors have substantially greater resources than headwaters and headwaters resources 
if they were to begin to compete in the national market  or in regions where they currently do not have operations  headwaters resources could lose market share and associated revenues 
headwaters construction materials competes against numerous national and regional manufacturers  some of which are significantly larger than headwaters and may have greater financial  manufacturing and distribution resources than headwaters 
for the hti business  many of the world s major chemical companies are devoting significant resources to researching and developing nanocatalysts and catalytic processes 
these companies have greater financial  management and other resources than does headwaters 
headwaters business strategy to diversify through acquisitions may result in integration costs  failures and dilution to existing stockholders 
an important business strategy of headwaters is diversification and growth through acquisitions 
headwaters ability to successfully implement headwaters strategy is subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in identifying acceptable acquisition candidates  consummating acquisitions on favorable terms and obtaining adequate financing  which may adversely affect its ability to develop new products and services and to compete in headwaters rapidly changing marketplace 
in addition  if headwaters consummates acquisitions through an exchange of securities  its existing stockholders could suffer dilution 
successful management and integration of acquisitions are subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  including loss of key employees  diversion of management s attention from core business operations  assumption of contingent liabilities and incurrence of potentially significant write offs 
this strategy may not improve headwaters operating results and acquisitions may have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders 
if headwaters internal controls over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act are not adequate  our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny  civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires that headwaters evaluates and reports on its system of internal controls beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ending september  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny  civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation 
any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business 
section of the sarbanes oxley act also requires that our independent auditors report on management s evaluation of our system of internal controls 
headwaters is in the process of documenting and testing its system of internal controls to provide the basis for its report 
further  the growth and diversification of our business through acquisitions complicates the process of developing  documenting and testing internal controls 
at this time  due to the ongoing evaluation and testing  no assurance can be given that there may not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported 
if headwaters is unable to manage the growth of its business successfully  its revenues and business prospects could suffer 
headwaters has experienced significant growth recently  both internally and through acquisitions 
headwaters may not be able to successfully manage the increased scope of its operations or a significantly larger and more geographically diverse workforce as headwaters expands 
any failure to successfully manage growth could harm its business and financial results 
additionally  growth increases the demands on headwaters management  headwaters internal systems  procedures and controls 
to successfully manage growth  headwaters must add administrative staff and periodically update and strengthen its operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls  which will increase its costs and may reduce its profitability 
headwaters may be unable to successfully implement improvements to headwaters information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
unauthorized use of or infringement claims regarding headwaters proprietary intellectual property could adversely affect headwaters ability to conduct its business 
headwaters has relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect its intellectual property 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may misappropriate  infringe upon  copy or reverse engineer portions of headwaters technology 
headwaters does not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated 
headwaters business could be harmed if it infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others 
headwaters has been  and may be in the future  notified that headwaters may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
if any such claims are asserted against headwaters  headwaters may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms  precluding use of the applicable technology 
alternatively  headwaters may decide to litigate such claims or attempt to design around the patented technology 
to date  while no single patent or trademark is material to headwaters business and the issues described in this paragraph have not resulted in significant cost or had an adverse impact on headwaters business  future actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of headwaters management and technical personnel 
headwaters highly leveraged capital structure affects its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions and results in high interest costs 
as of september   headwaters had approximately million of total debt outstanding  including million of senior indebtedness under its senior secured credit facilities and million of its subordinated convertible notes notes 
subject to restrictions in headwaters senior secured credit facility  headwaters may also incur significant amounts of additional debt for working capital  capital expenditures and other purposes 
headwaters combined debt total could have important consequences  including the following o headwaters may have difficulty borrowing money for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes because of headwaters existing debt load and because headwaters borrowings are secured by all of its assets  o headwaters will need to use a large portion of headwaters cash flow to pay interest and the required principal payments on its debt  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance headwaters operations  capital expenditures and other activities  and o headwaters senior secured credit facilities have a variable rate of interest  which exposes headwaters to the risk of increased interest rates 
headwaters ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on or to refinance headwaters indebtedness depends on its future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond headwaters control 
headwaters business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service headwaters debt and make necessary capital expenditures 
if unable to generate such cash flow  headwaters may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as selling assets  restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive 
covenant restrictions under headwaters senior secured credit facility may limit headwaters ability to operate its business in a manner required to sustain profitability and generate growth 
headwaters senior secured credit facilities  contain  among other things  covenants that may restrict headwaters ability to finance future operations or capital needs  to acquire additional businesses or to engage in other business activities 
the senior secured credit facilities require approval for new acquisitions funded with aggregate cash consideration in excess of million per year and million in the aggregate until such time as headwaters debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio is reduced to a specified amount 
in addition  headwaters senior secured credit facilities set forth covenants requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests which may require that headwaters take action to reduce its debt or to act in a manner contrary to its business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facilities  in which event the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
if headwaters is not able to repay its obligations when they become due or are accelerated  the lenders could foreclose on headwaters assets 
the indenture for the notes does not restrict the amount of indebtedness  including senior indebtedness  that headwaters may incur 
headwaters may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of headwaters notes or may otherwise be restricted from making such repurchase if required by holders pursuant to the indenture  which would result in a default under headwaters indenture which in turn might constitute a default under the terms of its other indebtedness  causing much or all of headwaters indebtedness to become due simultaneously when headwaters is unable to pay it 
on june   or in the event of a designated event under the indenture  holders may require headwaters to repurchase their notes at a price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including liquidated damages  if any  to  but excluding  the repurchase date 
however  it is possible that headwaters will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase of notes 
in addition  any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to its indebtedness may contain provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances  or may provide that a designated event constitutes an event of default under that agreement 
if any agreement governing headwaters indebtedness prohibits headwaters from repurchasing the notes when headwaters becomes obligated to do so  headwaters could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or attempt to refinance this debt 
if headwaters does not obtain such consent or refinance the debt  it would not be permitted to repurchase the notes 
headwaters failure to repurchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which might constitute a default under the terms of headwaters other indebtedness  causing much or all of headwaters indebtedness to become due simultaneously when headwaters is unable to pay it 
delaware law and headwaters charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover  which could cause the market price of headwaters shares to decline 
headwaters is a delaware corporation  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of headwaters  even if a change in control would be beneficial to existing stockholders 
in addition  headwaters board of directors has the power  without stockholder approval  to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock  including the adoption of a poison pill  which could be used defensively if a takeover is threatened 
the ability of headwaters board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law and headwaters certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving headwaters or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for headwaters common stock  which  under certain circumstances  could reduce the market price of headwaters common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk headwaters is exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to changes in interest rates 
headwaters does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  but has entered into hedge transactions to limit its exposure for interest rate movements  as explained below 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  headwaters has approximately million of variable rate long term debt outstanding as of september   consisting of million of senior debt and million of notes payable to a bank 
the million of term loan borrowings under the senior debt agreements consisted of a first lien term loan in the amount of million and a second lien term loan in the amount of million 
the first lien term loan bears interest  at headwaters option  at either i the london interbank offered rate libor plus  if the total leverage ratio  as defined  is less than or equal to  and if not  at libor plus  or ii the base rate plus  if the total leverage ratio is less than or equal to  and if not  at the base rate plus 
base rate is defined as the higher of the rate announced by morgan stanley senior funding and the overnight rate charged by the federal reserve bank of new york plus 
the interest rate on the first lien debt at september  was approximately  but was reduced to approximately in october the second lien term loan bears interest  also at headwaters option  at either libor plus  or the base rate plus 
the interest rate on the second lien debt at september  was approximately  but was reduced to approximately in october headwaters can lock in new rates for both the first lien and second lien loans for one  two  three or six months 
the next rate change will occur in january in connection with the new senior secured credit facility  headwaters entered into certain hedge agreements to limit its exposure to interest rate increases 
the first set of agreements established the maximum libor rate for million of debt at through september  the second set of agreements sets the libor rate at for million of debt for the period commencing september  through september  headwaters accounts for these agreements as cash flow hedges  and accordingly  the fair market value of the hedges is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as either other assets or other liabilities 
the hedges had a fair market value of at inception and through the period ended september  in connection with the acquisition of scp  headwaters assumed scp s obligations under its notes payable to a bank  totaling million 
two of the notes bear interest at libor plus  subject to an interest rate floor of at september   and the remaining note in the amount of million bears interest at below the bank s base rate at september a change in the interest rate of would change headwaters interest expense by approximately million during the year ending september   considering all outstanding balances of variable rate debt and required principal repayments 
the majority of headwaters short term investments  all of which are classified as trading securities  consist of fixed rate us government securities or securities backed by the us government 
changes in interest rates can affect the market value of these investments  which are carried at market value in the consolidated balance sheet 
the periodic adjustments to reflect changes in market value are included in interest and net investment income in the consolidated statements of income 
based on the current amount of short term investments and expected near term changes in the amount of short term investments  headwaters does not expect any material near term investment losses to result from changes in interest rates
