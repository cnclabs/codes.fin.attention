the company markets its products and services worldwide  primarily to large companies in the military aerospace  communications  computer  consumer electronics  semiconductor  networking  multimedia and transportation industries 
through the diversification of the company s customer base among these various customer markets  the company attempts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations within each market 
the company sells and licenses its products through its direct sales force and a channel of distributors and sales representatives 
in addition to its corporate offices in wilsonville  oregon  the company has sales  support  software development and professional service offices worldwide 
business environment beginning in late  the electronics industry experienced a broad economic downturn 
since a majority of the company s business originates from electronics industry customers  the company was negatively impacted 
the semiconductor industry  a subset of the electronics industry  experienced the deepest downturn in its history 
as a result of this downturn  customers reduced research and development r d budgets  limited general investment in design tools and reduced engineering staff 
in addition  many smaller companies and start ups went out of business 
the continued weakness in the semiconductor industry has caused companies to continue to limit eda spending in however  even in a depressed environment  customers still require the newest tools to solve leading edge design problems 
the company attempts to fill those demands through its relatively young and diverse product portfolio 
as a result  the company had a solid despite the economic troubles facing many of its customers 
because the company s products address not only semiconductor design  but a wide range of systems design  the negative impact of the semiconductor industry downturn was partly mitigated 
strength in system design in the military and aerospace segments helped drive revenue growth for the company in the first half of as customer demand expanded during this time  the company was able to leverage its strength in system design relative to its major competitors 
as the semiconductor industry began to stabilize in the second half of  newer integrated circuit ic design tool sales increased 
for the company  this resulted in a strong second half of led by its physical verification product family 
in general  the company s management believes that eda spending by semiconductor companies lags their recovery by several quarters for two primary reasons 
first  because of the importance of r d to the future of semiconductor companies  customers try to moderate r d spending reductions during downturns in comparison to other expense items 
as a result  r d spending as a percentage of revenue increases 
as revenues grow in the early stages of the recovery  customers constrain spending increases until r d returns to more typical percentage of revenue levels 
second  as a result of reduced engineering staff  customers hold excess software licenses of established tools 
hiring must resume before additional software licenses will be required 
the exception is for newer software that customers have not previously purchased 
due to the severity of the economic downturn  the company s management is not predicting a broad recovery of eda spending in the company will continue its strategy of developing best in class point tools with number one market share potential 
this strategy creates a diversified product portfolio for the company that solves customers critical design problems 
the company s management believes that this product strategy  in conjunction with a customer diversification strategy  has helped reduce the impact of marketplace fluctuations in the past and should continue to do so in the future 
license model mix license model trends can have a material impact on various aspects of the company s business 
see critical accounting estimates revenue recognition on page for a description of the types of product licenses sold by the company 
as the mix among perpetual licenses  fixed term licenses term with upfront revenue recognition and term licenses with ratable or due and payable revenue recognition shifts  revenues  earnings  cash flow and days sales outstanding dso are either positively or negatively affected 
the year ended december  marked the third consecutive year in which  as a percentage of product revenue  term revenue increased while perpetual revenue decreased 
this trend was primarily the result of two factors 
first  the company s customers are moving toward the term license model  which provides the customer with greater flexibility for product usage  including the ability to share the products between multiple locations and reconfigure consumption at regular intervals from a fixed product list 
as such  some of the company s customers have converted their existing installed base from perpetual to term licenses 
second  the weakness in the united states economy has disproportionately impacted the company s smaller customers 
historically these customers have purchased under the perpetual license model 
under this current shift from perpetual licenses to term licenses with upfront revenue recognition  which the company s management views as a positive trend  the company expects no measurable impact to earnings  but a negative impact on cash 
table of contents flow and dso 
as customers move away from perpetual licenses and into term licenses  the renewability and repeatability of the company s business is increased 
this provides opportunity for increased distribution of young products earlier in their lifecycles 
product developments during  the company continued to execute its strategy of focusing on new customer problem areas  as well as building upon its well established product families 
the company s management believes that customers  faced with leading edge design challenges  choose the best products in each category to build their design environment 
the company has focused its internal development efforts on areas where it believes it can build a number one market position  or extend an existing number one market position 
significant new products delivered by the company in in the area of printed circuit board design included boardlink pro a tool that enables large and complex fpgas to be efficiently incorporated into the design process  teampcb a tool that allows multiple designers to simultaneously work on the same design without affecting each other s work and advanced high speed design and analysis software 
also during the year  the company acquired dde  a company with leading software for advanced packaging design 
in the calibre design to silicon platform  the company continued to extend the value of the platform  obtaining significant new customer engagements and orders with its resolution enhancement technology 
during the year  the company also worked on developing new design for manufacturing tools that are expected to debut in the company launched its scalable verification environment featuring a suite of tools designed to solve the verification challenges that design engineers face 
according to collett international  an industry analyst firm  engineers spend approximately of their design effort verifying their designs 
this dominance of verification in the design process has driven many customers to seek new solutions to enhance their verification abilities 
the company s management believes that the development and commercialization of eda software tools is usually a multi year process with limited customer adoption in the first years of tool availability 
once tools are adopted  however  their life spans tend to be long and healthy 
the company s management believes that the company s relatively young and diverse product lines are positioned well for continued growth 
financial performance total revenues were  a increase over  resulting from strength in the calibre product line  increased demand from the military and aerospace industries and the innoveda acquisition 
product revenue split by license model was term with upfront revenue recognition  perpetual and term with ratable or due and payable revenue recognition  compared to product revenue splits of term with upfront revenue recognition  perpetual and term with ratable or due and payable revenue recognition 
term product revenue increased to  as compared to  in service and support revenues were  a increase over service and support revenues of  reflecting the growth in our installed base offset by the impact of generally lower renewal rates 
by geography  year over year revenue increased in the americas  in europe  in japan and in pacific rim 
the americas contributed the largest share of revenue at nearly 
net income was  compared to a net loss of  in the increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
trade accounts receivable  net increased to  at year end  up from  at the end of average days sales outstanding increased from days at the end of to days at the end of the increase in days sales outstanding was primarily due to a higher percentage of product revenue from term versus perpetual contracts in the fourth quarter of  some of which reflect front end weighted customer payment schedules  and to a lesser extent  maturities of back end loaded term transactions 
cash used in operating activities was  compared to  in at year end  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  up from  at the end of our cash balance increase was primarily due to proceeds from debt issuance offset by a repurchase of common stock and an emulation litigation settlement 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under 
table of contents the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company reports revenue in two categories based upon how the revenue is generated i system and software and ii services and support 
system and software revenue system and software revenues are derived from the sale of licenses of software products and emulation hardware systems 
the company licenses software using two different license types term licenses are for a specified time period  typically three years with payments spread over the license term  and do not provide the customer with the right to use the product after the end of the term 
the company generally recognizes product revenue from term installment license agreements upon shipment and start of the license term 
the company uses these agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
if the company no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change would have a material impact on the company s near term results of operations 
in a situation in which a risk of concession may exist on a term license agreement  revenue is recognized on a due and payable basis 
in a term license agreement where the company provides the customer with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products  revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
perpetual licenses provide the customer with the right to use the product in perpetuity and typically do not provide for extended payment terms 
the company recognizes product revenue from perpetual license agreements upon delivery to the customer when the likelihood of product return is remote 
if the agreement provides for customer payment terms that are different than the standard payment terms in the customer s jurisdiction  product revenue is recognized as payments become due and payable 
service and support revenue service and support revenues consist of revenues from support contracts and professional services  which include consulting services  training services and other services 
the company records service revenue as the services are provided to the customer 
support revenue is recognized over the support term 
for multi element arrangements that include support  support is allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of support 
for term licenses  vsoe is established by the price charged when such support is offered as optional during the license term 
for perpetual licenses  vsoe is established by the price charged when such support is sold separately 
the company determines whether software product revenue recognition is appropriate based upon the evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists an agreement signed by the customer and the company 
delivery has occurred the software has been shipped  the customer is in possession of the software or the software has been made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
fee is fixed and determinable the amount of the fee and the due date have been fixed at execution of the arrangement without the possibility of future adjustments or concessions 
collectibility is probable the customer is expected to pay for products or services without the company providing future concessions to the customer 
valuation of trade accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on trade accounts receivable and term receivables  long term for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments

also  if the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance on such net deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is determined by comparing its carrying amount  including any associated intangible assets  to the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the asset relates 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then intangible assets are written down first  followed by the other long lived assets of the operation  to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator using a fair value approach 
in the event that  in the future  it is determined that the company s goodwill  intangible or other long lived assets have been impaired  an adjustment would be made that would result in a charge for the write down in the period that determination was made 
inventory the company purchases and commits to purchase inventory based upon forecasted shipments of its emulation hardware systems

the value assigned to in process r d for the charges incurred in and related to research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the value was determined by estimating the net cash flows from the sale of products resulting from the completion of such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows was based on the weighted average cost of capital 
other factors considered were the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of the technology  the profitability levels of the technology and the stage of completion of the technology 
the stage of completion of the products at the date of the acquisition were estimated based on r d costs that had been expended as of the date of acquisition as compared to total r d costs expected at completion 
the percentages derived from this calculation were then applied to the net present value of future cash flows to determine the in process charge 
the nature of the efforts to develop the in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specification  including function  features and technical performance requirements 
the estimated net cash flows from these products were based on estimates of related revenues  cost of sales  r d costs  selling  general and administrative costs and income taxes 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur or that the company will realize any anticipated benefits of the acquisition

accordingly  primarily as a result of the intercompany sale  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by  in  with  of the related benefit being applied directly to contributed capital as a tax benefit of stock option exercises 
in  the company reduced the amount payable by its foreign subsidiary for the transfer of ikos technology rights by approximately  this was due to declining emulation revenue primarily attributable to lower prices paid by customers as a result of intense competition and the weakened economy 
as a result of the corresponding decrease in the projected taxable gain  the deferred tax charge recorded in for this transaction was reduced by  the amortization of deferred tax charge for was  the remaining balance of the deferred tax charge as of december  was  the decrease in projected income tax expense from this transaction resulted in the restoration of  of deferred tax assets that were not utilized under the revised transaction 
the company had net deferred tax assets of  at december   an increase of  from december  this increase was a result of current year net operating losses in the united states and certain other jurisdictions  the intercompany technology transfer discussed above and an adjustment relating to the purchase of ikos  recording additional deferred tax assets identified in the preparation of the final pre acquisition ikos tax return and correspondingly decreasing goodwill 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the weight of available evidence  the company has provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
a portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates to the difference between financial and tax reporting of employee stock option exercises  for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied directly to increase contributed capital 
a portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relates to certain of the tax attributes acquired from ikos  for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied directly to reduce goodwill 
the remainder of the valuation allowance was based on the historical earnings patterns within individual taxing jurisdictions that make it uncertain that the company will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
the company has settled its federal income tax obligations through and is currently under an internal revenue service examination in the united states for years and the results of this examination are unknown at this time  however  the company believes the provisions for income taxes for years since are adequate 
effects of foreign currency fluctuations approximately half of the company s revenues and approximately one third of its expenses are generated outside of the united states 
for and  approximately one fourth of european and all japanese revenues were subject to exchange rate fluctuations as they were booked in local currencies 
most large european revenue contracts are denominated and paid to the company in the united states dollar while the company s european expenses  including substantial research and development operations  are paid in local currencies causing a short position in the euro and the british pound sterling 
in addition  the company experiences greater inflows than outflows of japanese yen as substantially all japanese based customers contract and pay the company in local currency

for exposures that are not offset  the company enters into short term foreign currency 
table of contents forward and option contracts to partially offset these anticipated exposures 
the option contracts are generally entered into at contract strike rates that are different than current market rates 
as a result  any unfavorable currency movements below the strike rates will not be offset by the foreign currency option contract and could negatively affect operating results 
these contracts address anticipated future cash flows for day to one year periods and do not hedge of the potential exposures related to these currencies 
as a result  the effects of currency fluctuations could have a substantial effect on the company s overall results of operations 
foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income reported in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets  increased to  at december  from  at december  this reflects the increase in the value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies since year end as a result of a weaker united states dollar at the close of versus new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

average days sales outstanding in total accounts receivable increased from days at the end of to days at the end of the increase in total accounts receivable days sales outstanding was primarily due to a higher percentage of product revenue from term versus perpetual contracts in  some of which reflect front end weighted customer payment schedules  and to a lesser extent  maturities of back end loaded term transactions 
in quarters where term contract revenue is recorded  only the first twelve months of the receivable is reflected in current trade accounts receivable 
in the following quarters  the amount due in the next twelve months is reflected in current trade accounts receivable without the corresponding revenue 
as a result  if the company s mix of contracts were to shift to a higher percentage of term contracts  average days sales outstanding would be expected to increase

the company anticipates that current cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operating activities  including the effects of financing customer term receivables  and amounts available under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs on a short term and long term basis

actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
the following discussion highlights factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the company s forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
weakness in the united states and international economies may materially adversely affect the company 
united states and international economies are experiencing an economic downturn which has had an adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
continued weakness in these economies is likely to continue to adversely affect the timing and receipt of orders for the company s products and the company s results of operations 
revenue levels are dependent on the level of technology capital spending  which include expenditures for eda  software and other consulting services  in the united states and abroad 
a number of telecommunications companies have in the recent past filed for bankruptcy protection  and others have announced significant reductions and deferrals in capital spending 
a significant portion of the company s revenues has historically come from businesses operating in this sector 
in addition  demand for the company s products and services may be adversely affected by mergers and company restructurings in the electronics industry worldwide which could result in decreased or delayed capital spending patterns 
the company is subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries  and the current downturn has  and any future downturns may  materially adversely affect the company 
purchases of the company s products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics systems companies 
the integrated circuit industry is highly cyclical and is subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both companies in these industries and their 
table of contents customers products and a decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns have caused diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
certain integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics systems companies announced a slowdown of demand and production in  which has continued 
during downturns such as the current one  the number of new design projects decreases 
the current slowdown has reduced  and any future downturns are likely to further reduce  the company s revenue and could materially adversely affect the company 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell the company s products could hurt the company s business and the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced  and may continue to experience  varied quarterly operating results 
various factors affect the company s quarterly operating results and some of these are not within the company s control  including the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell the company s products 
the company receives a majority of its software product revenue from current quarter order performance  of which a substantial amount is usually booked in the last few weeks of each quarter 
a significant portion of the company s revenue comes from multi million dollar contracts  the timing of the completion of and the terms of delivery of which can have a material impact on revenue recognition for a given quarter 
if the company fails to receive expected orders in a particular quarter  particularly large orders  the company s revenues for that quarter could be adversely affected and the company could fail to meet investors expectations which could adversely affect the company s stock price 
the company uses fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice 
these multi year  multi element term license agreements are typically three years in length  with payments spread over the license term and with customers the company believes are credit worthy 
these agreements increase the risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product dissatisfaction  disagreements and disputes 
if the company is unable to collect under any of these multi million dollar agreements  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company uses these fixed term license agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
if the company no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due and payable over the license term 
this change would have a material impact on the company s results 
in a situation in which a risk of concession may exist on a term license agreement  revenue is recognized on a due and payable basis 
the company s revenue is also affected by the mix of licenses entered into where the company recognizes software product revenue as payments become due and payable or ratably over the license term as compared to revenue recognized at the beginning of the license term 
the company recognizes revenue ratably over the license term when the customer is provided with rights to unspecified or unreleased future products 
a shift in the license mix toward increased ratable or due and payable revenue recognition would result in increased deferral of software product revenue to future periods and would decrease current revenue  possibly resulting in the company not meeting revenue expectations 
the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition have been subject to authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software product revenue at the beginning of the license period 
these new and revised standards and interpretations could adversely affect the company s ability to meet revenue projections and affect the company s stock price 
the gross margin on the company s software products is greater than that for the company s hardware products  software support and professional services 
therefore  the company s gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold 
additionally  the margin on software products varies year to year depending on the amount of third party royalties due to third parties from the company for the mix of products sold 
the company also has a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs  such as professional service employee costs and purchased technology amortization  and costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically 
as a result  a small failure to reach planned revenue would have a great negative effect on resulting earnings 
if anticipated revenue does not materialize as expected  the company s gross margins and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
forecasting the company s tax rates is complex and subject to uncertainty 
forecasts of the company s income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty as the company s income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits losses earned by the company and its subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets and costs resulting from tax audits 
in order to forecast the company s global tax rate  pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated 
if the mix of profits and losses or effective tax rates by jurisdiction are different than those estimates  the company s actual tax rate could be materially different than forecast 

table of contents the lengthy sales cycle for the company s products and services and delay in customer consummation of projects makes the timing of the company s revenue difficult to predict 
the company has a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends between three and six months 
the complexity and expense associated with the company s products and services generally requires a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process 
consequently  the company may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent the company from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of the company s products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review procedures  timing of budget cycles or timing of competitive evaluation processes 
any loss of the company s leadership position in certain portions of the eda market could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the industry in which the company competes is characterized by very strong leadership positions in specific portions of the eda market 
for example  one company may enjoy a large percentage of sales in the physical verification portion of the market while another will have a similarly strong position in mixed signal simulation 
these strong leadership positions can be maintained for significant periods of time as the software is difficult to master and customers are disinclined to make changes once their employees  as well as others in the industry  have developed familiarity with a particular software product 
for these reasons  much of the company s profitability arises from niche areas in which it is the strong leader 
conversely  it is difficult for the company to achieve significant profits in niche areas where other companies are the leaders 
if for any reason the company loses its leadership position in a niche  the company could be materially adversely affected 
intense competition in the eda industry could materially adversely affect the company 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can lead to  among other things  price reductions  longer selling cycles  lower product margins  loss of market share and additional working capital requirements 
the company s success depends upon the company s ability to acquire or develop and market products and services that are innovative and cost competitive and that meet customer expectations 
the company currently competes primarily with two large companies cadence design systems  inc and synopsys  inc 
in june  synopsys completed its acquisition of avant corporation and the combined company could improve its competitive position with respect to the company 
the company also competes with numerous smaller companies  a number of which have combined with other eda companies 
the company also competes with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed  or have the capability to develop  their own eda products internally 
the company may acquire other companies and may not successfully integrate them or the companies the company has recently acquired 
the industry in which the company competes has seen significant consolidation in recent years 
during this period  the company has acquired numerous businesses  and it is frequently in discussions with potential acquisition candidates and may acquire other businesses in the future 
for example  the company is presently engaged in acquisition discussions with several companies 
while the company expects to carefully analyze all potential transactions before committing to them  the company cannot assure that any transaction that is completed will result in long term benefits to the company or its shareholders or that the company s management will be able to manage the acquired businesses effectively 
in addition  growth through acquisition involves a number of risks 
if any of the following events occurs after the company acquires another business  it could materially adversely affect the company difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from day to day business when evaluating and negotiating acquisition transactions and then integrating the acquired business  the discovery after the acquisition has been completed of liabilities assumed with the acquired business  the failure to realize anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business  difficulties related to assimilating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering and customer support areas  unanticipated costs  adverse effects on existing relationships with suppliers and customers  and 
table of contents failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited previous experience 
acquired businesses may not perform as projected  which could result in impairment of acquisition related intangible assets 
additional challenges include integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product offerings  integration of product development efforts  integration of systems of internal controls and integration of information systems 
accordingly  in any acquisition there will be uncertainty as to the achievement and timing of projected synergies  cost savings and sales levels for acquired products 
all of these factors can impair the company s ability to forecast  meet revenue and earnings targets and manage effectively the company s business for long term growth 
the company cannot assure that it can effectively meet these challenges 
risks of international operations and the effects of foreign currency fluctuations can adversely impact the company s business and operating results 
the company realizes approximately half of the company s revenue from customers outside the united states and approximately one third of the company s expenses are generated outside of the united states 
significant changes in exchange rates can have an adverse effect on the company 
for further discussion of foreign currency effects  see effects of foreign currency fluctuations discussion above 
in addition  international operations subject the company to other risks including longer receivables collection periods  changes in a specific country s or region s economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  limitations on repatriation of earnings and difficulties with licensing and protecting the company s intellectual property rights 
delay in production of components or the ordering of excess components for the company s mentor emulation division hardware products could materially adversely affect the company 
the success of the company s mentor emulation division depends on the company s ability to procure hardware components on a timely basis from a limited number of suppliers  assemble and ship systems on a timely basis with appropriate quality control  develop distribution and shipment processes  manage inventory and related obsolescence issues  and develop processes to deliver customer support for hardware the company s inability to be successful in any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company 
the company occasionally commits to purchase component parts from suppliers based on sales forecasts of the company s mentor emulation division s products 
if the company cannot change or be released from these non cancelable purchase commitments  or if orders for the company s products do not materialize as anticipated  the company could incur significant costs related to the purchase of excess components which could become obsolete before the company can use them 
additionally  a delay in production of the components could materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company s failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or adequately protect the company s proprietary rights could materially adversely affect the company 
the company s success depends  in part  upon the company s proprietary technology 
many of the company s products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties  and the company may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for software and other intellectual property in the future 
the company s failure to obtain software or other intellectual property licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights  could materially adversely affect the company 
the company generally relies on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect the company s proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions the company may take to protect the company s intellectual property  the company cannot assure that third parties will not try to challenge  invalidate or circumvent these safeguards 
the company also cannot assure that the rights granted under the company s patents will provide it with any competitive advantages  that patents will be issued on any of the company s pending applications or that future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect the company s proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as united states law protects these rights in the united states 
the company cannot assure you that the company s reliance on licenses from or to  or restrictive agreements with  third parties  or that patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protections  will be sufficient for success and profitability in the industries in which it competes 

table of contents future litigation proceedings may materially adversely affect the company 
the company cannot assure that future litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
any future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales and substantial unanticipated legal costs and divert the efforts of management personnel  any and all of which could materially adversely affect the company 
errors or defects in the company s products and services could expose us to liability and harm the company s reputation 
the company s customers use the company s products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity and have unique specifications 
because of the complexity of the systems and products with which the company works  some of the company s products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  the company s customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in the company s software or the systems we design  or the products or systems incorporating the company s designs and intellectual property may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of current customers and loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problems resulting from errors or defects  and increased service costs 
the company s failure to attract and retain key employees may harm the company 
the company depends on the efforts and abilities of the company s senior management  the company s research and development staff and a number of other key management  sales  support  technical and services personnel 
competition for experienced  high quality personnel is intense  and the company cannot assure that it can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
the failure by the company to hire and retain such personnel would impair the company s ability to develop new products and manage the company s business effectively 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely affect the markets on which the company s securities trade  the markets in which the company operates  the company s operations and the company s profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect the company s operations and investment in the company s business 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the company s physical facilities or those of the company s suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of the company s products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect the company s sales 
any armed conflict entered into by the united states could have an impact on the company s sales and the company s ability to deliver products to the company s customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result from an armed conflict and could negatively impact the company s business 
the company currently has operations in pakistan and egypt  countries that maybe particularly susceptible to this risk 
the consequences of any armed conflict are unpredictable  and the company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in or exacerbate economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on the company s operating results  revenues and costs and may result in volatility of the market price for the company s securities 
the company s articles of incorporation  oregon law and the company s shareholder rights plan may have anti takeover effects 
the company s board of directors has the authority  without action by the shareholders  to designate and issue up to  shares of incentive stock in one or more series and to designate the rights  preferences and privileges of each series without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
additionally  the oregon control share act and the business combination act limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over the company 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of the company through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors 
in february  the company adopted a shareholder rights plan which has the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire control of the company in a transaction not approved by the company s board of directors 
the potential issuance of incentive stock  the provisions of the oregon control share act and the business combination act and the company s shareholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of the company  may discourage bids for the company s common stock at a premium over the market price of the company s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  the company s common stock
