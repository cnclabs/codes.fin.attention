item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in light of these and other uncertainties  you should not conclude that we will necessarily achieve any plans or objectives or projected financial results referred to in any forward looking statements 
item business 
we design  manufacture and market capital equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect products as well as service  maintain  repair and upgrade equipment  all used to assemble and or test semiconductor devices 
we are currently the world s leading supplier of semiconductor wire bonding assembly equipment  according to vlsi research  inc our business is currently divided into three product segments equipment  packaging materials  and wafer and package test interconnect products 
we completed the divestiture of our former advanced packaging technologies segment in february our goal is to be both the technology leader and the lowest cost supplier in each of our major lines of business 
we believe we are the only major supplier to the semiconductor assembly industry that can provide customers with semiconductor wire bonding equipment along with the complementary packaging materials and test interconnect products that actually contact the surface of the customer s semiconductor devices 
we believe that the ability to control all of these assembly related products provides us with a significant competitive advantage  and should allow us to develop system solutions to the new technology challenges inherent in assembling and packaging next generation semiconductor devices 
the semiconductor industry has been historically volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by downturns 
in response to recent downturns  we shifted our strategy  focusing on our larger  more established product lines  and divesting or discontinuing smaller or more speculative businesses 
additionally  we continuously seek to further reduce our cost structure by moving operations to lower cost areas  moving away from non core businesses  and increasing productivity 
we believe the historical volatility of the semiconductor industry both upward and downward will persist

table of contents products and services we offer a range of wire bonding equipment and spare parts  packaging materials  and test interconnect products 
set forth below is a table listing the net sales from continuing operations for each business segment for our fiscal years ended september    and in thousands fiscal year ended september  net sales net sales net sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect other in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the assets related to the saw and hard material blade businesses that were part of the equipment segment and packaging materials segment  respectively 
those businesses together had fiscal net sales of million 
comprised of sales associated with our substrate business that was closed in fiscal our equipment sales are highly volatile  based on the semiconductor industry s need for new capability and capacity  whereas packaging materials and test interconnect sales in general tend to be more stable  following the trend of total semiconductor unit production 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial results by business segment and sales by geographic location 
equipment we manufacture and market a line of wire bonders  which are used to connect very fine wires  typically made of gold  aluminum or copper  between the bond pads of a semiconductor die and the leads on the integrated circuit ic package to which the die has been attached 
we believe that our wire bonders offer competitive advantages by providing customers with high productivity throughput and superior package quality process control 
in particular  our machines are capable of performing very fine pitch bonding as well as creating the sophisticated wire loop shapes that are needed in the assembly of advanced semiconductor packages 
our principal products are ball bonders 
automatic ic ball bonders represent a large majority of our semiconductor equipment business 
as part of our competitive strategy  we have been introducing new models of ic ball bonders every to months  with each new model designed to increase both productivity and process capability compared to its predecessor 
in may  we began marketing the maxum ic ball bonder  which offered up to more productivity than its predecessor 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we began shipping the maxum plus to customers offering further productivity increases  as well as process capability improvements 
in addition  in january of  we began shipping the nu tek  a new automatic wire bonder optimized for low lead count ics and discrete device applications  which are both segments of the market where we had not previously participated 
specialty wire bonders 
we also produce other models of wire bonders  targeted at specific market niches  including the model  a large area ball bonder designed for wire bonding hybrid  chip on board  and other large area applications  the waferpro plus  for wafer level bumping for area array applications  the triton rda  a wedge bonder designed for ribbon bonding  and the model  a large area wedge bonder 
we also manufacture and market a line of manual wire bonders 

table of contents we believe that our industry knowledge and technical experience have positioned us to deliver innovative  customer specific offerings that reduce the cost of owning our equipment over its useful life 
in response to customer trends in outsourcing packaging requirements  we provide repair and maintenance services  a variety of equipment upgrades  machine and component rebuild activities and expanded customer training through our customer operations group 
packaging materials we manufacture and market a range of semiconductor packaging materials and expendable tools for the semiconductor assembly market  including very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades  all of which are used in packaging and assembly processes 
our packaging materials are designed for use on both our own and our competitors assembly equipment 
a wire bonder uses a capillary or wedge tool and bonding wire much like a sewing machine uses a needle and thread 
our principal products are bonding wire 
we manufacture very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire used in the wire bonding process 
this wire is bonded to the chip surface and package substrate by the wire bonder and becomes a permanent part of the customer s semiconductor package 
we produce wire to a wide range of specifications  which can satisfy most wire bonding applications across the spectrum of semiconductor packages 
expendable tools 
our expendable tools include a wide variety of capillaries  wedges  die collets and wafer saw blades 
the capillaries and wedges actually attach the wire to the semiconductor chip  allow a precise amount of wire to be fed out to form a permanent wire loop  then attach the wire to the package substrate  and finally cut the wire so that the bonding process can be repeated again 
die collets are used to pick up and place die into packages before the wire bonding process begins 
our hub blades are used to cut silicon wafers into individual semiconductor die 
test interconnect we offer a broad range of fixtures used to temporarily contact a semiconductor device while it is still in the wafer format wafer probing  thereby providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
we also offer test sockets used to test the final semiconductor package package or final testing 
our principal test interconnect products are probe cards 
probe cards consist of complex  multilayer printed circuit boards pcb upon which are attached numerous probe needles designed to make temporary contact to each of the bond pads or bumps on a die while the die is still in a wafer format  providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
automatic test equipment ate interface assemblies 
ate interface assemblies typically consist of electro mechanical assemblies  electrical contactors and intricate multilayer pcbs  which mechanically and electrically connect to the ate test prober and carry electrical signals to a probe card  and ultimately the semiconductor device under test 
test sockets 
test sockets hold packaged semiconductor devices while making electrical connections to their leads through spring loaded contacts 
changes in the design of a semiconductor device often require changes in the probe card  test socket and  in certain cases  the ate interface assembly used to test that semiconductor 
customers generally purchase new versions of these custom designed products each time there is a design change in the semiconductor being tested 
changes in semiconductor design and processes drive improvements in test interconnect technology in order to support significant increases in the number and density of bond pads or leads being tested and the speed of the electrical signals being tested 

table of contents customers our major customers include large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems 
customers may vary from year to year based on their capital investment and operating expense budgets 
the chart below shows our top ten end use customers  based on net sales  for each of the last three fiscal years fiscal fiscal fiscal advanced semiconductor engineering advanced semiconductor engineering advanced semiconductor engineering st microelectronics st microelectronics st microelectronics siliconware precision industries intel texas instruments intel amkor technologies intel texas instruments texas instruments siliconware precision industries infineon technologies infineon technologies spansion amkor technologies national semiconductor national semiconductor national semiconductor philips electronics st assembly test samsung st assembly test infineon technologies philips electronics siliconware precision industries amkor technologies accounted for more than of total fiscal year net sales 
we believe that developing long term relationships with our customers is critical to our success 
by establishing these relationships with semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor subcontract assemblers  and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems  we gain insight into our customers future ic packaging strategies 
this insight assists us in our efforts to develop material  equipment and process solutions that address our customers future assembly requirements 
international operations we sell our products to semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor subcontract assemblers  and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems  which are primarily located in or have operations in the asia pacific region 
approximately of our fiscal net sales  of our fiscal net sales  and of our fiscal net sales were for delivery to customer locations outside of the united states 
the majority of these foreign sales were destined for customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea  japan  china and the philippines 
we expect sales outside of the united states to continue to represent a majority of our future revenues 
a majority of our manufacturing operations also are in countries other than the us  including major manufacturing operations located in singapore  israel  and china and other smaller facilities in france  japan  scotland  switzerland and taiwan 
risks associated with our international operations include risks of foreign currency and foreign financial market fluctuations  international exchange restrictions  changing political conditions and monetary policies of foreign governments  terrorism  war  civil disturbances  expropriation  and other events that may limit or disrupt markets 
sales and customer support we believe that providing comprehensive worldwide sales  service  training and support are important competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment industry  and we manage these functions through our global customer operations group 
some of these operations are focused on wire bonders and packaging materials  and others focus on test related products 
we rely on a combination of a direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and distributors for the sale of our various product lines 
in order to support our customers whose semiconductor assembly operations are located primarily outside of the united states  we have sales  service  and support personnel based in china  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and europe  and applications labs in singapore  japan  israel  taiwan  and germany 
we provide timely customer service and support by positioning our service representatives and spare parts near customer facilities  and afford customers the ability to place orders locally and to deal with service and support personnel who speak the customer s language and are familiar with local country practices 
backlog at september   we had a backlog of customer orders totaling million  compared to million at june  and million at september  our backlog consists of customer orders which are scheduled for shipment within months 
virtually all orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer with 
table of contents limited or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of revenues for any succeeding quarterly period 
for example  on august   we announced that discussions with customers indicated a general slowing in the rate of semiconductor growth 
as a result  some of these customers requested that we delay the shipment of wire bonders previously ordered and included in our backlog of customer orders at june  manufacturing the company believes excellence in manufacturing can create a competitive advantage  both through lower costs and superior responsiveness 
in order to achieve these goals  we manage our manufacturing operations through a single organization and are trending to fewer  larger factories to take advantage of economies of scale and the cost savings available in low labor cost areas 
equipment 
our equipment manufacturing activities consist primarily of integrating outsourced parts and subassemblies  and testing the finished product to customer specifications 
during fiscal  most of our equipment manufacturing took place in singapore  with a small number of machines built in willow grove  pennsylvania 
we believe the outsourcing model enables us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures and focus on product differentiation through technology innovations in system design and manufacturing quality control 
just in time inventory management has reduced our manufacturing cycle times and reduced our on hand inventory requirements 
we have received iso certification for our equipment manufacturing facility in singapore 
packaging materials 
we manufacture expendable tools at facilities in yokneam  israel and suzhou  china  and bonding wire at facilities in singapore and thalwil  switzerland 
we manufacture blades for wafer sawing in santa clara  california 
our bonding wire facility in switzerland has received iso certification  our bonding wire facility in singapore has received qs and iso certifications  our blade facility in california has received iso certification  our bonding tools facility in yokneam  israel has received iso and iso certifications  and our bonding tools facility in suzhou  china has received iso and iso certifications 
test interconnect products 
we manufacture test probe cards in various facilities located in gilbert  arizona  hayward and san jose  california  hsin chu  taiwan  east kilbride  scotland  singapore  suzhou  china  and corbeil  france 
we manufacture ate interface assemblies in gilbert  arizona and test sockets in hayward  california and singapore 
as part of our ongoing cost reduction activities  we sold our ate test board fabrication assets in dallas  texas in the third quarter of fiscal and moved to an outsource strategy for these components  and in fiscal we closed a test manufacturing facility in meyreuil  france 
research and product development many of our customers generate technology roadmaps describing the future manufacturing capability requirements needed to support their product development plans 
our research and product development activities are organized so that our products anticipate our customers requirements 
this can happen either through continuous improvement of our existing products  including upgrades for products already installed in customers facilities  or through the creation of next generation products 
examples of our continuous improvement strategy include the nutek and maxum plus wire bonders mentioned above both improvements of the maxum our advanced epoxy line of probe cards  and our duracap line of bonding tools 
major next generation development is underway for our wire bonder  probe card and test socket product lines 
whether we proceed via continuous improvement  or via next generation technology development  our goal is technology leadership in each of our major product lines 
our net expenditures for research and development totaled approximately million  million  and million during our fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
competition the market for semiconductor equipment  packaging materials  and test interconnect products is intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include price  as well as speed throughput  
table of contents production yield  and customer support  each of which contribute to lower the overall cost per package being manufactured 
our major equipment competitors include wire bonders asm pacific technology and shinkawa significant competitive factors in the semiconductor packaging materials industry include performance  price  delivery  product life  and quality 
our significant packaging materials competitors include bonding tools gaiser tool co  small precision tools  inc and peco saw blades disco corporation bonding wire tanaka electronic industries  sumitomo metal mining  heraeus  and nippon metal 
our test products face competition from a few large international firms as well as many small regional firms 
significant competitive factors in the test interconnect industry include performance  price  delivery time  product life  and quality 
our significant competitors include wafer test formfactor  inc  japan electronic materials  and micronics japan company package test everett charles  synergetix  johnstech international  enplas semiconductor in each of the markets we serve  we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  some of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
some of our competitors are asian and european companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers because many of these customers appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
intellectual property where circumstances warrant  we seek to obtain patents on inventions governing new products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research  engineering and manufacturing activities 
we currently hold a number of united states patents  some of which have foreign counterparts 
we believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the life cycles of the technologies disclosed and claimed in the patents 
we believe that our portfolio of patents will have more value in the future but that our success will depend primarily on our engineering  manufacturing  marketing and service skills 
in addition  we believe that much of our important technology resides in our trade secrets and proprietary software 
as long as we rely on trade secrets and unpatented knowledge  including software  to maintain our competitive position  we cannot assure you that competitors may not independently develop similar technologies and possibly obtain patents containing claims applicable to our products and processes 
our ability to defend ourselves against these claims may be limited 
in addition  although we execute non disclosure and non competition agreements with certain of our employees  customers  consultants  selected vendors and others  there is no assurance that such secrecy agreements will not be breached  or that they can be enforced 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees 
in addition  we are subject to environmental laws which may require investigation and cleanup of any contamination at facilities we own or operate or at third party waste disposal sites we use or have used 
these laws could impose liability upon us even if we did not know of  or were not responsible for  the contamination 
we have in the past and will in the future incur costs to comply with environmental laws 
we are not  however  currently aware of any costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters  including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third party waste disposal sites  that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
it is possible  however  that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future 

table of contents employees at september   we had  permanent employees and temporary and contract workers worldwide 
the only employees represented by a labor union are the bonding wire employees in singapore 
generally  we believe our employee relations to be good 
competition in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry is intense  particularly with respect to engineering 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees

introduction we design  manufacture and market capital equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect products as well as service  maintain  repair and upgrade equipment  all used to assemble or test semiconductor devices 
we are currently the world s leading supplier of semiconductor wire bonding assembly equipment  according to vlsi research  inc our business is currently divided into three product segments equipment  packaging materials  and wafer and package test interconnect products 
we believe we are the only major supplier to the semiconductor assembly industry that can provide customers with semiconductor wire bonding equipment along with the complementary packaging materials and test interconnect products that actually contact the surface of the customer s semiconductor devices 
we believe that the ability to control all of these assembly related products provides us with a significant competitive advantage and should allow us to develop system solutions to the new technology challenges inherent in assembling and packaging next generation semiconductor devices 
in the march quarter  we sold the remaining assets of our advanced packaging technologies segment  which consisted solely of our flip chip business unit which licensed flip chip technology and provided flip chip bumping and wafer level packaging services 
as a result  we have reflected the flip chip business unit as a discontinued operation and 
table of contents have not included the results of its operations in our revenues and expenses from continuing operations as reported in our financial statements or in this discussion of our results of operations 
we have reclassified our prior period financial statements to coincide with the current year presentation 
the semiconductor industry historically has been volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by downturns 
one such downturn started in fiscal and persisted throughout most of fiscal the industry recovered from this downturn in late fiscal through the first three quarters of fiscal as a result of the industry recovery throughout the majority of fiscal and our continuing efforts to reduce our operating expenses and manage our business  we achieved the following in fiscal net sales increased to million sg a and r d expenses decreased by million long term notes were refinanced resulting in a million reduction in annualized cash interest expense million in fiscal  a million reduction in our long term notes and  an extension of the maturity date of the long term notes 
generated net income of million generated million of cash from operating activities while we achieved the above positive results in fiscal  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we experienced a fall off in sales compared to our third quarter 
based on declining order activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal  customer indications and other factors we believe that the semiconductor industry entered a downturn 
there can be no assurances regarding levels of demand for our products  and in any case  we believe the historical volatility both upward and downward will persist 
during the industry downturn from fiscal through most of fiscal  we incurred significant resizing charges to scale down the size of our business and consolidated operations 
even after implementing these formal resizing plans see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements  we have continued to lower our cost structure by further consolidating operations  moving certain of our manufacturing capacity to china  moving a portion of our supply chain to lower cost suppliers and designing better but lower cost equipment 
cost reduction efforts have become an important part of our normal ongoing operations and we believe this will drive down our cost structure below current levels  while not diminishing our product quality 
however  we expect to incur additional quarterly charges such as severance and facility closing costs as a result of these long term cost reduction programs 
our goal is to be both the technology leader  and the lowest cost supplier in each of our major lines of business 
we reported a loss from operations of our test business segment of million in fiscal we are continuing with our plan to improve the performance of this segment through new product introductions  consolidation of test facilities  the transfer of a greater portion of test production to our asia facilities  and outsourcing a greater portion of the test production 
we expect this plan will continue through and will result in future period charges and or restructuring charges 

table of contents products and services we offer a range of wire bonding equipment and spare parts  packaging materials and test interconnect products 
set forth below is a table listing the percentage of our total net sales from continuing operations for each business segment for the three fiscal years ended september   and dollars in thousands fiscal year ended september  net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect other in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the assets related to the saw and hard material blade businesses that were part of the equipment segment and packaging materials segment  respectively 
those businesses had fiscal net sales of million 
comprised of sales associated with our substrate business that was closed in fiscal over time  our equipment sales are highly volatile  based on the semiconductor industry s need for new capability and capacity  whereas packaging materials and test interconnect sales tend to be more stable  following the trend of total semiconductor unit production 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial results by business segment 
equipment we manufacture and market a line of wire bonders  which are used to connect very fine wires  typically made of gold  aluminum or copper  between the bond pads of a semiconductor die and the leads on the integrated circuit ic package to which the die has been attached 
we believe that our wire bonders offer competitive advantages by providing customers with high productivity throughput and superior package quality process control 
in particular  our machines are capable of performing very fine pitch bonding as well as creating the sophisticated wire loop shapes that are needed in the assembly of advanced semiconductor packages 
our principal products are ball bonders 
automatic ic ball bonders represent a large majority of our semiconductor equipment business 
as part of our competitive strategy  we have been introducing new models of ic ball bonders every to months  with each new model designed to increase both productivity and process capability compared to its predecessor 
in may  we began marketing the maxum ic ball bonder  which offered up to more productivity than its predecessor 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we began shipping the maxum plus to customers offering further productivity increases  as well as process capability improvements 
in addition  in january of  we began shipping the nu tek  a new automatic wire bonder optimized for low lead count ics and discrete device applications  which are both segments of the market where we had not previously participated 
specialty wire bonders 
we also produce other models of wire bonders  targeted at specific market niches  including the model  a large area ball bonder designed for wire bonding hybrid  chip on board  and other large area applications  the waferpro plus  for wafer level bumping for area array applications  the triton rda  a wedge bonder designed for ribbon bonding  and the model  a large area wedge bonder 
we also manufacture and market a line of manual wire bonders 
we believe that our industry knowledge and technical experience have positioned us to deliver innovative  customer specific offerings that reduce the cost of owning our equipment over its useful life 
in response to customer trends in outsourcing packaging requirements  we provide repair and maintenance services  a variety of equipment upgrades  machine and component rebuild activities and expanded customer training through our customer operations group 
packaging materials we manufacture and market a range of semiconductor packaging materials and expendable tools for the semiconductor 
table of contents assembly market  including very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire  capillaries  wedges  die collets and saw blades  all of which are used in packaging and assembly processes 
our packaging materials are designed for use on both our own and our competitors assembly equipment 
a wire bonder uses a capillary or wedge tool and bonding wire much like a sewing machine uses a needle and thread 
our principal products are bonding wire 
we manufacture very fine gold  aluminum and copper wire used in the wire bonding process 
this wire is bonded to the chip surface and package substrate by the wire bonder and becomes a permanent part of the customer s semiconductor package 
we produce wire to a wide range of specifications  which can satisfy most wire bonding applications across the spectrum of semiconductor packages 
expendable tools 
our expendable tools include a wide variety of capillaries  wedges  die collets and wafer saw blades 
the capillaries and wedges actually attach the wire to the semiconductor chip  allow a precise amount of wire to be fed out to form a permanent wire loop  then attach the wire to the package substrate  and finally cut the wire so that the bonding process can be repeated again 
die collets are used to pick up and place die into packages before the wire bonding process begins 
our hub blades are used to cut silicon wafers into individual semiconductor die 
test interconnect we offer a broad range of fixtures used to temporarily contact a semiconductor device while it is still in the wafer format wafer probing  thereby providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
we also offer test sockets used to test the final semiconductor package package or final testing 
our principal test interconnect products are probe cards 
probe cards consist of complex  multilayer printed circuit boards pcb upon which are attached numerous probe needles designed to make temporary contact to each of the bond pads or bumps on a die while the die is still in a wafer format  providing electrical connections to automatic test equipment 
automatic test equipment ate interface assemblies 
ate interface assemblies typically consist of electro mechanical assemblies  electrical contactors and intricate multilayer pcbs  which mechanically and electrically connect to the ate test prober and carry electrical signals to a probe card  and ultimately the semiconductor device under test 
test sockets 
test sockets hold packaged semiconductor devices while making electrical connections to their leads through spring loaded contacts 
changes in the design of a semiconductor device often require changes in the probe card  test socket and  in certain cases  the ate interface assembly used to test that semiconductor 
customers generally purchase new versions of these custom designed products each time there is a design change in the semiconductor being tested 
changes in semiconductor design and processes drive improvements in test interconnect technology in order to support significant increases in the number and density of bond pads or leads being tested and the speed of the electrical signals being tested 
accounting policies  pronouncements and estimates we believe the following accounting policy is critical to the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  the collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have satisfied any equipment installation obligations and received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue based upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
our standard terms are ex works k s factory  with title transferring to our customer at our loading dock or upon embarkation 
we do have a small percentage of sales with other terms  and revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the related customer purchase order 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service 
table of contents contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a prorated straight line basis over the term of the contract 
revenue from royalty arrangements and license agreements is recognized in accordance with the contract terms  generally prorated over the life of the contract or based upon specific deliverables 
our business is subject to contingencies related to customer orders as follows right of return a large portion of our revenue comes from the sale of machines that are used in the semiconductor assembly process 
these items are generally built to order  and often include customization to a customer s specifications 
other product sales relate to consumable products  which are sold in high volume quantities  and are generally maintained at low stock levels at our customer s facility 
as a result  customer returns represent a very small percentage of customer sales on an annual basis 
our policy is to provide an allowance for customer returns based upon our historical experience and management assumptions 
warranties our products are generally shipped with a one year warranty against manufacturer s defects and we do not offer extended warranties in the normal course of our business 
we recognize a liability for estimated warranty expense when revenue for the related product is recognized 
the estimated liability for warranty is based upon historical experience and our estimates of future expenses 
conditions of acceptance sales of our consumable products and bonding wire generally do not have customer acceptance terms 
in certain cases  sales of our equipment products do have customer acceptance clauses which generally require that the equipment perform in accordance with specifications during an on site factory inspection by the customer  as well as when installed at the customer s facility 
in such cases  if the terms of acceptance are satisfied at our facility prior to shipment  the revenue for the equipment will be recognized upon shipment 
if the customer must first install the equipment in their own factory  then generally  revenue associated with that sale is not recognized until acceptance is received from the customer 
price protection we do not provide price protection to our customers 
critical estimates and assumptions generally accepted accounting principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the more significant areas involving the use of estimates in our financial statements include allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  carrying value and lives of fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  self insurance reserves  pension benefit liabilities  resizing  warranty  litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which are the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we are also subject to concentrations of customers and sales to a few geographic locations  which would also impact the collectability of certain receivables 
if economic or political conditions were to change in some of the countries where we do business  it could have a significant impact on the results of our operations  and our ability to realize the full value of our accounts receivable 
inventory reserves 
we generally provide reserves for equipment inventory and spare part and consumable inventories considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future demand  and test interconnect inventory considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future demand 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and a review of consumable inventory levels at our customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to our suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
if 
table of contents required  we rereserve for the difference between the carrying value of our inventory and the lower of cost or market value  based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and the next cyclical market upturn 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory reserves may be required 
we review and dispose of excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets 
our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets is based upon our estimates of future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we manage and value our intangible technology assets in the aggregate  as one asset group  not by individual technology 
we perform our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with our annual planning process 
we also test for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs 
our impairment testing resulted in an impairment charge of million in fiscal in our flip chip business unit and a fiscal impairment charge of million in the test business unit and million in the hub blade business 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in accordance with sfas and sfas deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
in fiscal and we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets generated from our us net operating losses 
in fiscal we reversed the portion of the valuation allowance that was equal to the us federal income tax expense on our us income 
if the company were to generate additional us net operating loss carryforwards  additional valuation allowances would be set up against these deferred tax assets 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for exit or disposal activities which addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we have adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  however  this standard will in certain circumstances change the timing of recognition of restructuring resizing costs 
overview of statement of operations net sales 
our equipment sales depend on the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers worldwide which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and technology driven advancements in semiconductor design 
the semiconductor industry historically has been highly volatile  and has experienced periodic downturns followed by rebounds 
downturns have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment 
for example  a downturn in the semiconductor industry from fiscal through most of fiscal contributed to lower net sales in each of those fiscal years in comparison to our fiscal net sales 
this downturn was followed by increased market demand during most of our fiscal resulting in an increase in our equipment net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced weakening customer demand for our equipment and we expect further weakening in the first quarter of fiscal our packaging materials sales depend on manufacturing expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers and subcontract assemblers  many of which also purchase our equipment products 
however  the volatility in demand for our packaging materials is less than that of our equipment sales due to the consumable nature of these products 

table of contents our test interconnect solutions sales depend on the manufacturing expenditures of some of the same semiconductor manufacturers and subcontractors as our equipment and packaging materials sales as well as other customers 
because of the consumable and customized nature of most of our test products  however  the volatility in demand for these test products is less than that of our equipment sales 
cost of goods sold 
equipment cost of goods sold consists mainly of subassemblies  materials  direct and indirect labor costs and other overhead 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we rely on sole source suppliers for some material components 
packaging materials cost of goods sold consists primarily of gold and aluminum  direct labor and other materials used in the manufacture of bonding wire  capillaries  wedges and other company products  with gold making up the majority of the cost 
gold bonding wire is generally priced based on a fabrication charge per  feet of wire  plus the value of the gold 
to minimize our exposure to gold price fluctuations  we obtain gold for fabrication under a contract with our gold supplier which generally matches the price we pay for the gold with the price we invoice our customers 
accordingly  fluctuations in the price of gold are generally absorbed by our gold supplier or passed on to our customers 
since gold makes up a significant portion of the cost of goods sold of our bonding wire business unit  the gross profit as a percentage of sales of that business unit and therefore the packaging materials segment will be lower than can be expected in the equipment business 
we rely on one supplier for our gold requirements 
test interconnect cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor and indirect labor for engineering design and materials used in the manufacture of wafer and ic package testing cards and devices 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense is comprised primarily of personnel and related costs  professional costs  and depreciation expense 
research and development expense 
our research and development costs consist primarily of labor  prototype material and other costs associated with our development efforts to strengthen our product lines and develop new products and depreciation expense 
included in research and development expense is the cost to develop the software that operates our semiconductor assembly equipment  which is expensed as incurred 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended september   september  and september  the table below shows the principal line items from our historical consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of our net sales  for the three years ended september fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development  net resizing asset impairment goodwill impairment amortization of goodwill and intangibles gain on sale of assets loss on sale of product lines income loss from operations fiscal years ended september  and september  bookings and backlog 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded bookings of million compared to million in fiscal a booking is recorded when a customer order is reviewed and a determination is made that all specifications can be met  production or service can be scheduled  a delivery date can be set  and the customer meets the company s credit requirements 
at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled million  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
for example  on august   we announced that discussions with customers indicated a general slowing in the rate of semiconductor growth 
as a result  some of these customers requested that we delay the shipment of wire bonders previously ordered and included in our backlog of customer orders at june  sales business segment net sales dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  change equipment packaging materials test interconnect other na comprised of residual sales associated with our substrate business that was closed in fiscal sales 
net sales from continuing operations for the year ended september  were million  an increase of from million in fiscal due primarily to the improved demand in the semiconductor industry for our automatic ball bonders throughout the majority of fiscal our equipment segment was the primary beneficiary of the increased demand in the semiconductor industry during fiscal 
table of contents  recording an increase in net sales compared to the prior year 
according to vlsi research  our market share of worldwide revenue for automatic ball bonders for the first half of calendar increased to from in the second half of calendar and in the first half of calendar the higher net sales resulted primarily from a increase in unit sales of our automatic ball bonders 
we recorded our highest quarterly ball bonder unit volume in the history of the company in the second quarter of fiscal this large percentage increase in ball bonder unit sales was partially offset by the elimination of sales of dicing saws in fiscal due to the sale of this business in august  relatively flat sales in specialty bonders and spare parts  and a lower average selling price asp per ball bonder 
the blended asp for our automatic ball bonders was lower than the prior year  due primarily to customer mix 
this reflected general lowering of asp for any particular model over its product life cycle 
to mitigate this we introduce new models with additional features that enable us to demand a higher selling price 
we experienced a higher asp on our newer maxum plus model compared to maxum 
the blended asp varies with the proportion of newer models sold and with customer mix 
our packaging materials business also benefited from the increased demand in the semiconductor industry with a million or increase in net sales 
our capillary unit sales were up in fiscal compared to the prior year 
blended capillary asp was down slightly from the prior year 
the reduction in blended capillary asp is a function of the general decline in unit prices and mix between high and low end capillaries 
high end capillaries support advanced packaging applications and have higher asp s 
as in our equipment business  we introduce new capillaries with additional capabilities that enable us to demand a higher selling price 
our wire unit sales measured in kft increased in fiscal over the prior year due to increased orders from existing customers and new customers 
wire asp is heavily dependent upon the price of gold and can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in fiscal the price of gold accounted for approximately million of the sales increase over the prior year and the increase in unit volume accounted for approximately million of the increase 
our test interconnect sales were million in fiscal or above the prior year 
our vertically configured retractable pin probe cards accounted for million of the increase due to higher unit sales 
net sales of our other major test product lines were slightly above the prior year but negatively impacted by the sale of our pc board business in the second quarter of fiscal our sales of pc board products were approximately million lower in fiscal compared to the prior year 
blended asps are not meaningful in the test business due to lack of a standard unit of measure and the large difference in part types sold 
as such  blended asp s are not a metric used by management for test interconnect sales 
the majority of our sales are to customers that are located outside of the united states or that have manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised of our total sales in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of these foreign sales were to customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea and japan 
taiwan accounted for the largest single destination for our product shipments with of our shipments in fiscal compared to of our shipments in the prior fiscal year 

table of contents gross profit business segment gross profit dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect other na comprised of residual gross profit associated with our substrate business that was closed in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased million in fiscal from the prior year and our gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved percentage points 
the higher gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the improved demand in the semiconductor industry  particularly for our automatic ball bonders 
included in the results for fiscal were million of inventory write downs 
included in the results for fiscal is a charge for inventory write downs of million 
our equipment gross profit increased million from the prior year and the equipment gross margin increased percentage points from the prior year 
the higher sales volume of ball bonders accounted for million of the increased gross profit and an reduction in the manufacturing cost per ball bonders partially offset by the lower asp accounted for million of the improvement 
our lower cost per unit was the main reason for the percentage point increase in gross margin and due to the lowering of production costs over our products life cycle via better supply chain management  engineering more cost effective parts and volume purchasing 
our packaging materials gross profit increased million from the prior year  with capillaries gross profit accounting for million of the increase 
higher capillary unit volume accounted for million of this improvement and lower capillary costs associated with shifting a portion of capillary production to china accounted for million of the variance 
these favorable results were partially offset by lower capillary asp s 
our wire gross profit was approximately million higher than the prior year reflecting higher unit sales measured in kft but the wire gross margin was lower than the prior year due to the increase in the price of gold  which makes up a significant portion of our wire cost of sales 
our test interconnect business gross profit increased million and its gross margin increased percentage points 
the higher gross profit and gross margin was due primarily to higher unit sales in our vertically configured retractable pin probe cards and test sockets product lines and the associated manufacturing efficiencies 
duplicate costs associated with the start up of production of cantilever products in our china facility partially offset the positive impact from the higher vertical and package test sales 

table of contents operating expenses dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales selling  general and administrative research and development  net resizing recovery costs asset impairment gain on sale of assets amortization of intangible assets loss on sale of product lines selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses were relatively flat when compared with the prior year but sg a expense as a percentage of sales was down percentage points 
in fiscal  sg a expense included a variable expense for incentive compensation of million compared to no expense for incentive compensation in the prior year 
also included in fiscal were severance charges of million million of which was associated with the closing of a probe card production facility in france  and million of start up costs in our china facility to transition production capacity 
included in the sg a expense for fiscal were costs associated with workforce reductions severance of million  start up costs for our new china facility of approximately million  and a million charge for the early termination of an information technology services agreement  partially offset by the favorable reversal of a million reserve previously established for potential obligations to us customs 
other than the above mentioned costs  our sg a costs were lower than the prior year and reflected our efforts to contain operating costs with higher sales volume 
the workforce reduction severance charges identified in the previous paragraph were included in sg a expense because they were not related to formal and distinct restructuring programs  but rather  they were normal and recurring management of employment levels in response to business conditions and our ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure 
also  if the business conditions had improved  we were prepared to rehire some of these terminated individuals 
these charges are in contrast to the formal and distinct resizing programs we established in prior fiscal years 
research and development 
research and development r d expense in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal while we saw lower payroll and related expenses due to our ongoing cost reduction efforts  we continued to invest in the development of next generation wire bonders and new products for our test interconnect business 
in fiscal we also purchased a license for an interconnection device which we believe will form the nucleus for our next generation of semiconductor sockets for our package test products 
resizing the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns 
the industry experienced excess capacity and a severe contraction in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment during our fiscal  and most of we developed formal resizing plans in response to these changes in the business environment with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
accounting for resizing activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans 
we documented and committed to these plans to reduce spending that included facility closings rationalizations and reductions in workforce 
we recorded the expense associated with these plans in the period that we committed to carry out the plans 
although we made every attempt to consolidate all known resizing activities into one plan  the extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places limitations on achieving this objective 
the recognition of a resizing event does not necessarily preclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods 
in fiscal  we reversed thousand of these resizing charges and in fiscal we reversed thousand of these resizing charges due to the actual severance cost associated with the terminated positions being less than the cost originally estimated 
we recorded resizing charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
table of contents in addition to the formal resizing costs identified below  we continued and are continuing to downsize our operations in fiscal  and these downsizing efforts resulted in workforce reduction charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in contrast to the resizing plans discussed above  these workforce reductions were not related to formal or distinct restructurings  but rather  the normal and recurring management of employment levels in response to business conditions and our ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure 
in addition  during fiscal  if the business conditions were to have improved  we were prepared to rehire some of these terminated individuals 
these recurring workforce reduction charges were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
a summary of the charges  reversals and payments of the formal resizing plans initiated in fiscal appears below in thousands fiscal resizing plans severance and benefits commitments total provision for resizing plans in fiscal continuing operations discontinued operations payment of obligations in fiscal balance  september  change in estimate payment of obligations in fiscal balance  september  change in estimate payment of obligations balance  september  the individual resizing plans and acquisition restructuring plans initiated in fiscal are identified below fourth quarter in january  we acquired the advanced substrate technology of micromodule systems  a cupertino  california company  to enable production of high density substrates 
while showing some progress in developing our substrate technology  the business was not profitable and would have required additional capital and operating cash to complete development of the technology 
in light of the business downturn that was affecting the semiconductor industry at the time  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we could not afford to further develop the substrate technology and would close our substrate operations 
as a result  we recorded a resizing charge of million 
the resizing charge included a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions and lease obligations of million 
we expected  and achieved  annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately million as a result of this resizing plan 
by june   all the positions had been eliminated 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the lease obligations are expected to continue into  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in addition to these resizing charges  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of fixed assets and million of intangible assets associated with the closure of the substrate operation 
this substrate business was included in our then existing advanced packaging business segment 
third quarter as a result of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry and our desire to improve the performance of our test business segment  we decided to move towards a hour per day manufacturing model in our major us wafer test facility  which would provide our customers with faster turn around time and delivery of orders and economies of scale in manufacturing 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan to reduce headcount and consolidate manufacturing in our test business segment 
as part of this plan  we moved manufacturing of wafer test products from our facilities in gilbert  arizona and austin  texas to our facilities in san jose  california and dallas  texas and from our kaohsuing  taiwan facility to our hsin chu  taiwan facility 
the resizing plan included a severance 
table of contents charge of million for the elimination of positions as a result of the manufacturing consolidation 
the resizing plan also included a charge of million associated with the closure of the kaohsuing  taiwan facility and an austin  texas facility representing costs of non cancelable lease obligations beyond the facility closure and costs required to restore the production facilities to their original state 
we expected  and achieved  annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately thousand as a result of this resizing plan 
all of the positions have been eliminated and both facilities have been closed 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance  facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue through  or such earlier time as the obligations can be satisfied 
second quarter as a result of the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry and our desire to more efficiently manage our business  in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan comprised of a functional realignment of business management and the consolidation and closure of certain facilities 
in connection with the resizing plan  we recorded a charge of million million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  consisting of severance and benefits of million for positions that were to be eliminated as a result of the functional realignment  facility consolidation  the shift of certain manufacturing to china including the company s hub blade business and the move of our microelectronics products to singapore and a charge of million for the cost of lease commitments beyond the closure date of facilities to be exited as part of the facility consolidation plan 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we closed five test facilities two in the united states  one in france  one in malaysia  and one in singapore 
these operations were absorbed into other company facilities 
the resizing charge for the facility consolidation reflects the cost of lease commitments beyond the exit dates that are associated with these closed test facilities 
to reduce our short term cash requirements  we decided  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  not to relocate our hub blade manufacturing facility from the united states to china or our microelectronics product manufacturing from the united states to singapore  as previously announced 
this change in our facility relocation plan resulted in a reversal of million of the resizing costs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as a result  we reduced our expected annual savings from this resizing plan for payroll related expenses by approximately million 
also in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed thousand thousand in continuing operations and thousand in discontinued operations of the severance resizing expenses and in the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed thousand of resizing expenses  previously recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  due to actual severance costs associated with the terminated positions being less than those estimated as a result of employees leaving the company before they were severed 
as a result of the functional realignment  we terminated employees at all levels of the organization from factory workers to vice presidents 
the organizational change shifted management of our company businesses to functional ie sales  manufacturing  research and development  etc 
areas across product lines rather than by product line 
for example  research and development activities for the entire company are now controlled and coordinated by one corporate vice president under the functional organizational structure  rather than separately by each business unit 
this structure provides for a more efficient allocation of human and capital resources to achieve corporate r d initiatives 
we expected annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately thousand as a result of this resizing plan 
as a result of the decision not to relocate our hub blade manufacturing facility or our microelectronics product manufacturing we ultimately achieved annual payroll related savings of approximately million 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance charges are expected to continue into  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
asset impairment 
in fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million associated with exiting our pc board fabrication business and the closure of a probe card production facility in france 
the fiscal charge included  million associated with the discontinuation of a test product  million due to the reduction in the size of a test facility in dallas  texas  and thousand resulting from the write down of assets that were sold and assets that became obsolete 

table of contents we perform our annual test for impairment of intangible assets at the end of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with the completion of our annual forecasting process 
however  we also test for impairment whenever a triggering event occurs 
we performed interim goodwill impairment tests on the goodwill associated with our test interconnect business during the quarters ended december  and march  due to the existence of an impairment trigger  which was the losses experienced at this business 
based on the results of these tests and our annual impairment test on intangibles assets associated with both our wire and test businesses  no impairment charge was recorded in fiscal the fair value of the wire and test reporting units was based on discounted cash flows of our projected future cash flows from this reporting unit  consistent with the methods used in fiscal and when conducting our goodwill impairment analysis  we calculate our potential impairment charges based on the two step test identified in sfas and using the implied fair value of the respective reporting units 
we use the present value of future cash flows from the respective reporting units to determine the implied fair value 
we also tested our intangible assets for impairment in the march quarter  as a result of the sale of certain assets of the test operations and recorded an impairment charge of million associated with the reporting unit s purchased technology intangible asset 
the million charge is included in the million asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we also recorded an asset impairment charge of million  to write down assets to their realizable value  in our discontinued flip chip operation 
gain in sale of assets 
in fiscal  we realized a gain of thousand on the sale of land and a building and thousand on the sale of a portion of our pc board business 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense in both fiscal and was associated with our intangible assets for customer accounts and completed technology arising from the acquisition of our test division 
the slightly lower amortization expense in fiscal compared to the prior year was due to the impairment of our complete technology intangible asset mentioned above 
the aggregate amortization expense for these items for each of the next five fiscal years is expected to approximate million 
loss on sale of product lines 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the fixed assets  inventories and intellectual property associated with our saw and hard material blade product lines for million in cash 
we wrote off million of net assets associated with the transaction 
in addition  we sold the assets associated with our polymers business for thousand 
this loss on sale of product lines of million has been reclassified to be included in our operating expenses section of the consolidated statement of operations  from its prior presentation outside of the operating results 
income loss from operations income loss from operations by business segments appears below dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect corporate and other  na  na our income from operations in fiscal was million compared to a loss from operations of million in the prior fiscal year 
the turn from a loss to profit generally reflected increased demand in the semiconductor industry throughout most of fiscal and our ongoing efforts to reduce operational expenses 
equipment operating income increased million from the prior year due primarily to higher sales and gross profit and lower operating costs 
packaging materials operating income increased million  also due primarily to 
table of contents higher sales and gross profit and lower operating costs 
test interconnect operating loss was million or less than the prior year due primarily to higher gross profit 
in order to improve the operating results of this business segment  we plan to consolidate test facilities  transfer a greater portion of the test production to our asian facilities  outsource a greater portion of the test production  and introduce new products 
we expect implementation of this plan will continue through and will result in future period charges and or restructuring charges 
our loss from corporate and other activities was million higher than the prior year due to recording million of employee incentive compensation expense in fiscal compared to no incentive compensation in the prior year 
interest and charge on early extinguishment of debt 
interest income in fiscal was million compared to thousand in the prior fiscal year 
the higher interest income in fiscal was due primarily to higher cash and short term investments 
interest expense in fiscal was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
interest expense in both fiscal and primarily reflects interest on our convertible subordinated notes 
the lower interest expense in fiscal was due to the refinancing of our and convertible subordinated notes with lower interest and convertible subordinated notes 
we also reduced the total amount of subordinated debt outstanding by million 
we incurred a cost of million to redeem our and convertible subordinated notes  of which was a cash expense associated with the redemption premium and was due to the write off of deferred financing expenses associated with the initial issuance of the notes 
tax expense 
tax expense in fiscal reflects income tax on income in foreign jurisdictions  alternative minimum tax on us income and certain state income tax 
in fiscal  we reversed the portion of our valuation allowance approximately million that was equal to our us taxable income  excluding taxable income subject to the us alternative minimum tax 
until we can be reasonably assured that we can utilize our us operating loss carryforwards  our income tax provision will reflect only us alternative minimum tax  certain state tax and foreign taxation 
our tax expense in fiscal reflects income tax on income in foreign jurisdictions 
in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against tax benefits from the fiscal losses in the us on october  the us government passed the american jobs creation act 
the act provides for certain tax benefits including but not limited to the reinvestment of foreign earnings in the united states 
we are currently evaluating the act and may or may not benefit from such provisions 
discontinued operations 
in february  we entered into a joint venture agreement with delco electronics corporation delco providing for the formation and management of flip chip technologies  llc fct 
fct was formed to license certain technologies and to provide wafer bumping services on a contract basis 
in march  we purchased the remaining interest in the joint venture owned by delco for million and included fct in our then existing advanced packaging business segment 
in fiscal  our then existing advanced packaging business segment consisted solely of fct  which was not profitable 
in february  we sold the assets of fct for approximately million in cash and notes and the agreement by the buyer to satisfy approximately million of our lease liabilities and the assumption of certain other liabilities 
the sale included fixed assets  inventories  and intellectual property of our flip chip business 
the major classes of fct assets and liabilities sold included million in accounts receivable  thousand in inventory  million in property  plant and equipment  thousand in other long term assets  million in accounts payable and million in accrued liabilities 
we recorded a net loss on the sale of fct of thousand 
net sales from fct in fiscal were million  and in fiscal were million 
the net loss of our former flip chip business unit comprises our discontinued operations 
included in the fiscal loss from discontinued operations is an asset impairment charge of million and a goodwill impairment charge of million 
net income loss 
our net income in fiscal was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal  for the reasons enumerated above 

table of contents fiscal years ended september  and september  bookings and backlog 
during the fiscal year ended september  we recorded bookings of million compared to million in fiscal at september   the backlog of customer orders totaled million  compared to million at september  since the timing of deliveries may vary and orders are generally subject to cancellation  our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period 
sales business segment net sales dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  change equipment packaging materials test interconnect other sales 
net sales from continuing operations for the year ended september  were million  an increase of from million in fiscal equipment sales were higher in fiscal compared to the prior year due primarily to a increase in unit sales of automatic ball bonders  which is the dominant product in the equipment business segment 
the increase in ball bonder unit sales was partially offset by lower sales of other bonding machines and accessories 
the blended average selling price per automatic ball bonder unit asp in fiscal was flat compared to the prior year 
however  asps generally go down over time for any particular model 
to mitigate this we introduce new models with additional features that enable us to demand a higher selling price 
the blended asp varies with the proportion of newer models sold and with customer mix 
packaging material sales in fiscal were higher then the prior year 
our capillary unit sales were up in fiscal  while our blended capillary asp was below the prior year 
blended capillary asp is a function of the general decline in unit prices and mix between high and low end capillaries 
high end capillaries support advanced packaging applications and have higher asp s 
as in our equipment business  we introduce new capillaries with additional features that enable us to demand a higher selling price 
our wire unit sales measured in kft decreased in fiscal due primarily to a shift in product mix from the prior year 
the lower wire unit sales were offset by an average increase of in the price of gold  which is reflected in our gold wire asp 
the price of gold has a significant impact on our wire asp and can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in fiscal  the increase in the price of gold accounted for million of the sales increase over the prior year 
our test interconnect sales in fiscal were below the prior year due primarily to lower unit sales in our cantilever product lines  partially offset by higher sales of vertical and package test products 
asps are not meaningful in the test business due to lack of a standard unit of measure and the large difference in part types sold 
as such  asps are not a metric used by the company s management 
the majority of our sales are to customers that are located outside of the united states or have manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
shipments of our products with ultimate foreign destinations comprised of our total sales in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of these foreign sales were to customer locations in the asia pacific region  including taiwan  malaysia  singapore  korea and japan 
taiwan accounted for the largest single destination for our product shipments with of our shipments in fiscal compared to of our shipments in the prior fiscal year 

table of contents gross profit dollars amounts in thousands fiscal year ended september  sales sales equipment packaging materials test interconnect other gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal included in the results for fiscal and fiscal are charges for inventory write downs of million and million  respectively 
the inventory write down charge in fiscal was due primarily to excess and obsolete inventory and discontinued products 
the charge for inventory write downs in fiscal includes three distinct components million related to the write down of spare parts inventories  million associated with the discontinuance of our model dual spindle saw  and million related to excess and obsolete inventory 
we provide reserves for equipment inventory and for spare parts and consumables inventory considered to be in excess of months of forecasted future demand 
the forecasted demand is based upon internal projections  historical sales volumes  customer order activity and review of consumable inventory levels at our customers facilities 
we communicate forecasts of our future demand to suppliers and adjust commitments to those suppliers accordingly 
we review and dispose of our excess and obsolete inventory on a regular basis 
in fiscal we disposed of million of excess and obsolete inventory and in fiscal we disposed of million of excess and obsolete inventory 
the charges for inventory write downs in fiscal and fiscal primarily involve items that are not part of our continuing product offerings and accordingly  should not have a significant impact on our future business or profitability 
our equipment gross margin increased percentage points from the prior year  of which percentage points was due to the inventory write offs discussed above 
excluding these inventory write offs  equipment gross margin increased by percentage points  due to reduction in the cost per ball bonder unit produced 
our lower cost per unit reflected the lowering of production costs over a product life cycle along with a change in product mix and our continuing efforts to drive down our cost structure 
our packaging materials gross margin was adversely affected by the higher price of gold in fiscal compared to fiscal  which makes up a significant portion of our wire cost of sales 
however  the higher capillary unit sales accounted for the increase in gross profit dollars 
our test interconnect gross margin decreased percentage points from fiscal  of which percentage points was due to the inventory write offs discussed above 
lower sales and associated gross profit accounted for the remaining reduction in test gross margin

selling  general and administrative referred to as sg a expenses decreased million in fiscal or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the lower sg a expenses in fiscal resulted primarily from our cost saving initiatives  principally related to reductions in employment levels 
included in the sg a expense for fiscal were costs associated with workforce reductions severance of million  start up costs for our new china facility of approximately million and a million charge for the early termination of an information technology services agreement partially offset by the favorable reversal of a million reserve  previously established for potential obligations to us customs 
included in the fiscal sg a expense were workforce reductions severance of million and training and start up costs for our new china facility of million 
the workforce reduction severance charges identified in the previous paragraph were included in sg a expense because they were not related to formal and distinct restructuring programs  but rather  they were normal and recurring management of employment levels in response to business conditions and our ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure 
also  if the business conditions had improved  we were prepared to rehire some of these terminated individuals 
these charges are in contrast to the formal and distinct resizing programs we established in prior fiscal years 
research and development 
research and development r d expense in fiscal decreased million or from fiscal the lower r d expense in fiscal was primarily due to the closure of our substrate business unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal and lower payroll and related expenses due to our ongoing cost reduction efforts 
resizing the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns 
the industry experienced excess capacity and a severe contraction in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment during our fiscal  and most of we developed formal resizing plans in response to these changes in our business environment with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
accounting for resizing activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans 
we documented and committed to these plans to reduce spending that included facility closings rationalizations and reductions in workforce 
we recorded the expense associated with these plans in the period that it committed to carry out the plans 
although we make every attempt to consolidate all known resizing activities into one plan  the extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting environment places limitations on achieving this objective 
the recognition of a resizing event does not necessarily preclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods 
in fiscal  we reversed thousand thousand in the first half of of these resizing charges due to the actual severance cost associated with the terminated positions being less than the cost originally estimated 
we recorded resizing charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition to the formal resizing costs identified below  we continued to downsize our operations in fiscal and these downsizing efforts resulted in workforce reduction charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in contrast to the resizing plans discussed above  these workforce reductions were not related to formal or distinct

the individual resizing plans and acquisition restructuring plans initiated in fiscal and are identified below charges in fiscal year fourth quarter in january  we acquired the advanced substrate technology of micromodule systems  a cupertino  california company  to enable production of high density substrates 
while showing some progress in developing the substrate technology  the business was not profitable and would have required additional capital and operating cash to complete development of the technology 
in light of the business downturn that was affecting the semiconductor industry at the time  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we could not afford further development of the substrate technology and would close our substrate operations 
as a result  we recorded a resizing charge of million 
the resizing charge included a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions and lease obligations of million 
we expected  and achieved  annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately million as a result of this resizing plan 
by june   all the positions had been eliminated 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the lease obligations are expected to continue into  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied 
in addition to these resizing charges  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of fixed assets and million of intangible assets associated with the closure of the substrate operation 
this substrate business was included in our then existing advanced packaging business segment

as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a resizing plan to reduce headcount and consolidate manufacturing in its test business segment 
as part of this plan  we moved manufacturing of wafer test products from our facilities in gilbert  arizona and austin  texas to our facilities in san jose  california and dallas  texas and from our kaohsuing  taiwan facility to our hsin chu  taiwan facility 
the resizing plan included a severance charge of million for the elimination of positions as a result of the manufacturing consolidation 
the resizing plan also included a charge of million associated with the closure of the kaohsuing  taiwan facility and an austin  texas facility representing costs of non cancelable lease obligations beyond the facility closure and costs required to restore the production facilities to their original state 
we expected  and achieved  annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately thousand as a result of this resizing plan 
all of the positions have been eliminated and both facilities have been closed 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance are expected to continue through fiscal and cash payments for facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue through  or such earlier time as the obligations can be satisfied

in connection with the resizing plan  we recorded a charge of million million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  consisting of severance and benefits of million for positions that were to be eliminated as a result of the functional realignment  facility consolidation  the shift of certain manufacturing to china including our hub blade business and the move of our microelectronics products to singapore and a charge of million for the cost of lease commitments beyond the closure date of facilities to be exited as part of the facility consolidation plan 

table of contents in the second quarter of fiscal  we closed five test facilities two in the united states  one in france  one in malaysia  and one in singapore 
these operations were absorbed into other company facilities 
the resizing charge for the facility consolidation reflects the cost of lease commitments beyond the exit dates that are associated with these closed test facilities 
to reduce our short term cash requirements  we decided  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  not to relocate either our hub blade manufacturing facility from the united states to china or our microelectronics product manufacturing from the united states to singapore  as previously announced 
this change in our facility relocation plan resulted in a reversal of million of the resizing costs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as a result  we reduced our expected annual savings from this resizing plan for payroll related expenses by approximately million 
also in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed thousand thousand in continuing operations and thousand in discontinued operations of the severance resizing expenses and in the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed thousand of resizing expenses  previously recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  due to actual severance costs associated with the terminated positions being less than those estimated as a result of employees leaving the company before they were severed 
as a result of the functional realignment  we terminated employees at all levels of the organization from factory workers to vice presidents 
the organizational change shifted management of the company businesses to functional ie sales  manufacturing  research and development  etc 
areas across product lines rather than by product line 
for example  research and development activities for the entire company are now controlled and coordinated by one corporate vice president under the functional organizational structure  rather than separately by each business unit 
this structure provides for a more efficient allocation of human and capital resources to achieve corporate r d initiatives 
we expected annual payroll related savings of approximately million and annual facility operating savings of approximately thousand as a result of this resizing plan 
as a result of the decision not to relocate either our hub blade manufacturing facility or its microelectronics product manufacturing  we ultimately achieved annual payroll related savings of approximately million 
the plans have been completed but cash payments for the severance charges and the facility and contractual obligations are expected to continue into fiscal  or such time as the obligations can be satisfied

in addition to the workforce resizings and the facility consolidations  over the past two fiscal years we have terminated several of our major initiatives in an effort to more closely align our cost structure with expected revenue levels 
as a result  we recorded asset impairment charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal charge included million associated with the discontinuation of a test product  million due to the reduction in the size of a test facility in dallas  texas  and thousand resulting from the write down of assets that were sold and assets that became obsolete 
the fiscal charge included million associated with the cancellation of a company wide integrated information system  million associated with the closure of the substrates operation  million charge for the write off of development and license costs of certain engineering and manufacturing software  which had not yet been completed or placed in service and would never be utilized  million associated with a closed wire facility in taiwan  and million related to leasehold improvements at the leased probe card manufacturing facilities in malaysia and the united states  which have been closed 
we also recorded an asset impairment charge of million  to write down assets to their realizable value  in our discontinued operation 
goodwill impairment 
effective october   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intangible assets that are classified as goodwill and those with indefinite lives are no longer amortized under the provisions of this standard 
intangible assets with determinable lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful life 
we perform our annual impairment test at the end of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  which coincides with the completion of our annual forecasting process 
we also test for impairment between our annual tests if a trigger event occurs that may have the effect of reducing the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
when conducting our goodwill impairment analysis  we calculate our potential impairment charges based on the two step test identified in sfas and using the implied fair value of the respective reporting units 
we use the present value of future cash flows from the respective reporting units to determine the implied fair value 
our intangible assets other than goodwill are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows  and if impaired  written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values 
our intangible assets are comprised of customer accounts and complete technology in its test interconnect business segment 
we manage and value our complete technology in the aggregate as one asset group 
in fiscal  we reviewed our business and determined that there are five reporting units to be reviewed for impairment in accordance with the standard the reporting units were the bonding wire  hub blade  substrate  flip chip and test businesses 
the bonding wire and hub blade businesses were included in our packaging materials segment  the substrate business was included in our advanced packaging segment  the test business comprised our test segment and the flip chip business unit is included in discontinued operations 
there is no goodwill associated with our equipment segment 
upon adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the required transitional impairment testing of intangible assets  and based upon those analyses  did not identify any impairment charges as a result of adoption of this standard effective october  upon adoption of the standard in fiscal  we reclassified million of intangible assets relating to an acquired workforce in the test reporting unit into goodwill and correspondingly reduced goodwill by million of goodwill associated with a deferred tax liability established for timing differences of us income taxes on the workforce 
table of contents intangible 
also in fiscal  we reduced goodwill associated with the test reporting unit by million reflecting the settlement of a purchase price dispute with the former owners of probe technology and increased goodwill associated with its flip chip reporting unit by thousand reflecting an increase in the cost to purchase the former joint venture partner s equity share 
in fiscal  and  the semiconductor industry experienced a severe industry downturn 
due to the prolonged nature of the industry downturn  we continually recalibrated our businesses and projections of future operating activities 
we saw an up tick in our business in the spring of and at that time believed we were emerging from the effects of an industry downturn 
however  this up tick in business was not sustained and our business turned back down in the second half of fiscal by the end of our fiscal  our recalibrated forecasts of future cash flows from our test  hub blades and substrate reporting units were substantially lower than in the beginning of that fiscal year  which lead to the closing of the substrate business and an associated write off of all the substrate intangible assets of million and goodwill impairment charges in the test business of million and in our hub blades business of million 
likewise  by the end of fiscal  our forecast of future cash flows from our flip chip business unit were lower than previous forecasts and resulted in goodwill and asset impairment charges of million and the subsequent sale of the assets of this business 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the period in which our analysis of future business conditions indicated that the reporting unit s fair value  and the implied value of its goodwill  was less than its carrying value 
due to the amount of goodwill associated with our test reporting unit  we retained a third party valuation firm to assist management in estimating the test reporting unit s fair value at september  the appraisal was based on discounted cash flows of this reporting unit 
the estimated fair value was determined using our weighted average cost of capital 
the estimated fair value was then corroborated by comparing the implied multiples applicable to the test reporting unit s projected earning to guideline companies forward earnings and based on this it was determined that they were within the range of the guideline companies 
the fair value of our test reporting unit at september  was determined in the same manner  however  as it was greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit  there was no goodwill impairment 
we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge at september  in our hub blade reporting unit 
we calculated the fair value of this reporting unit based on the present value of its projected future cash 
the estimated fair value was determined using our weighted average cost of capital 
the triggering event for this impairment charge was the recalibrated forecasts  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when we first determined that the fair value of the hub blade reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
in september  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge at our flip chip business unit 
the fair value of this reporting unit was determined using quoted prices from potential purchasers of this reporting unit 
the quoted prices were subsequently confirmed upon the sale of the assets of the flip chip reporting unit in february of the triggering event for this impairment charge was also recalibrated forecasts in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when we first determined that the fair value of our flip chip reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the lower amortization expense in fiscal was due to the elimination of amortization expense in fiscal on acquired technology at our former substrate business that was written off upon the closure of this business in the fourth quarter of fiscal the amortization expense in fiscal is associated with the intangible assets of our test business unit 
loss on sale of product lines 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the fixed assets  inventories and intellectual property associated with our sawing and hard material blade product lines for million in cash 
we wrote off million of net assets associated with the transaction 
in addition  we sold the assets associated with our polymers business for thousand 
this loss on sale of product lines of million has been reclassified to be included in our operating expenses section of the consolidated statement of operations  from its prior presentation outside of the operating results

the smaller operating loss in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to higher sales and gross profit  lower sg a and r d expenses  no resizing expenses  and lower asset and goodwill impairment charges 
equipment operating loss was reduced from million to million due primarily to higher sales and gross profit and lower operating costs 
packaging materials operating income increased by million or due primarily to recording million of assets and goodwill impairment charges in the prior year and higher sales and gross profit in the current year 
test interconnect operating loss was million less then the prior year due primarily to recording million of goodwill and assets impairment charges in the prior year compared to million of assets impairment charges in fiscal in order to improve the operating results of this business  we plan to consolidate test facilities  transfer a greater portion of the test production to our asian facilities  outsourcing a greater portion of the test production  and new product introductions 
we expect implementation of this plan will continue through and will result in future period charges and or restructuring charges 
our loss from corporate and other activities was million less than the prior year due to asset impairment charges of million and operating costs of our former substrate operation recorded in the prior year 
interest 
interest income in fiscal was thousand compared to million in the prior year 
the lower interest income was due primarily to lower cash balances to invest coupled with lower interest rates on short term investments 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the lower interest expense in fiscal resulted from the elimination in fiscal of interest associated with a receivable securitization program  which was cancelled in july of other income and minority interest 
other income of million in fiscal was associated with the cash settlement of an insurance claim associated with a fire in our bonding tools facility 
other income also includes minority interest of thousand in fiscal for the portion of the loss of a foreign test division subsidiary that was owned by a third party 
we purchased the third party s interest in fiscal tax expense

the tax expense in fiscal was due primarily to a million charge to establish a valuation allowance against our us net operating loss carryforwards  a million charge to provide for tax expense on repatriation of certain foreign earnings and foreign income taxes of million 
these charges were partially offset by a benefit of million from the pretax loss in the us discontinued operations

we received million from the exercise of stock options  and we received million from the sale of our flip chip business unit 
our primary need for cash for the next fiscal year will be to provide the working capital necessary to meet our expected production and sales levels and to make the necessary capital expenditures to enhance our production and operating activities 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditure needs to be approximately million 
we financed our working capital needs and capital expenditure needs in fiscal through internally generated funds from our equipment and packaging materials businesses and expect to continue to generate cash from operating activities in fiscal to meet our cash needs 
we expect to use the excess cash generated from our equipment and packaging materials business to fund the operation of our test business until such time that our test performance improvement plans are complete and our test segment is self funding 

table of contents our long term debt at september  and consisted of the following in thousands fiscal year of maturity conversion price rate outstanding balance at  september  type convertible subordinated notes convertible subordinated notes convertible subordinated notes convertible subordinated notes other subject to adjustment 
includes a mortgage of million held by a limited liability company which the company began consolidating into its financial statements at december  in accordance with fin in the quarter ended december   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement to qualified institutional investors 
the notes mature on november   bear interest at per annum and are convertible into common stock of the company at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment for certain events 
the notes are general obligations of the company and are subordinated to all senior debt 
the notes rank equally with the company s convertible subordinated notes 
there are no financial covenants associated with the notes and there are no restrictions on incurring additional debt or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
interest on the notes is payable on may and november each year 
we used the majority of the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes to redeem all of our million of convertible subordinated notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
we recorded a charge of million associated with the redemption of these notes  million of which was due to the write off of unamortized note issuance costs and million due to the redemption premium 
in the quarter ended june   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement to qualified institutional investors 
the notes mature on june   bear interest at per annum and are convertible into common stock of the company at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment for certain events 
the conversion rights of these notes may be terminated on or after june  if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days 
the notes are general obligations of the company and are subordinated to all senior debt 
the notes rank equally with our convertible subordinated notes 
there are no financial covenants associated with the notes and there are no restrictions on incurring additional debt or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
interest on the notes is payable on june and december each year 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes along with cash remaining from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes and cash from operations to purchase all of our convertible subordinated notes at purchase prices between and of the principal amount of the notes 
the company recorded a charge of million associated with the purchase of these notes  million of which was due to the write off of unamortized note issuance costs and million due to the purchase premium 
under gaap  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on our liquidity 
certain of the following commitments as of september  have not been included in our consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations included in this form k  however  they have been disclosed in the following table in order to provide a more complete picture of our financial position and liquidity 
the most significant of these are our operating lease commitments and inventory purchase obligations 

table of contents the following table identifies obligations and contingent payments under various arrangements at september   including those not included in our consolidated balance sheet in thousands total amounts due in less than year amounts due in years amounts due in years amounts due in more than years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations commercial commitments gold supply financing guarantee standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and commercial commitments represents contractual amounts not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at september  long term debt includes the amounts due under our convertible subordinated notes due  convertible subordinated notes due and a mortgage of million held by a limited liability company which the company began consolidating into its financial statements at december  in accordance with fin the capital lease obligations principally relate to a building lease 
the operating lease obligations represent obligations due under various facility and equipment leases with terms up to fifteen years in duration 
inventory purchase obligations represent outstanding purchase commitments for inventory components ordered in the normal course of business 
to reduce the cost to procure gold  we changed our gold supply financing arrangement in fiscal as a result  gold for wire fabrication is no longer treated as consignment goods and is now reflected and included in our inventory with a corresponding amount in accounts payable 
at september   both our inventory and accounts payable included million of this gold compared to none at september  although we no longer purchase gold on a consignment basis  our obligation to pay for the gold generally does not arise  and the price we pay for the gold is not fixed  until we price and sell the gold wire to our customers 
the guarantee for our gold supply financing arrangement is secured by the assets of our wire manufacturing subsidiary and contains restrictions on that subsidiary s net worth  ratio of total liabilities to net worth  ratio of ebitda to interest expense and ratio of current assets to current liabilities  all of which we were within compliance 
the standby letters of credit represent obligations of the company in lieu of security deposits for a facility lease and employee benefit programs 
at september   the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes was million  and the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes was million 
the fair values were determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of our other assets and liabilities approximates the book value of those assets and liabilities 
at september   the standard poor s rating on our convertible subordinated notes was ccc and our convertible subordinated notes were not rated 
we have a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees who were employed on september  the benefits for this plan were based on the employees years of service and the employees compensation during the three years before retirement 
our funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of us federal employee benefit and tax laws 
we contributed approximately million based on the market price at the 
table of contents time of contribution in company stock to the plan in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  we expect to make a contribution of company common stock of approximately million 
effective december   the benefits under the company s pension plan were frozen 
as a consequence  accrued benefits no longer change as a result of an employee s length of service or compensation 
we believe that our existing cash reserves and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  our liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on normal operations of the business and others related to uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
we may seek  as we believe appropriate  additional debt or equity financing to provide capital for corporate purposes 
we may also seek additional debt or equity financing for the refinancing or redemption of existing debt and or to fund strategic business opportunities  including possible acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances or other business arrangements which could require substantial capital outlays 
the timing and amount of such potential capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industry conditions  competitive factors  the condition of financial markets and the nature and size of strategic business opportunities which we may elect to pursue 
risk factors the semiconductor industry is volatile with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns our operating results are significantly affected by the capital expenditures of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and by those of vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems 
expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and by vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors  including personal computers  telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics  and automotive goods 
significant downturns in the market for semiconductor devices or in general economic conditions reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with periods of rapid growth followed by industry wide retrenchment 
these periodic downturns and slowdowns have adversely affected our business  financial condition and operating results 
they have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity  and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
these downturns historically have severely and negatively affected the industry s demand for capital equipment  including the assembly equipment  the packaging materials and test interconnect solutions that we sell 
the semiconductor industry experienced downturns in fiscal through the first half of fiscal  in fiscal through the first three quarters of fiscal and we are currently seeing a slowing in customer demand for our wire bonders 
in the downturn  our net sales declined from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the downturn  our net sales declined from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal the business environment was improved in the fourth quarter of fiscal through the first nine months of fiscal but we experienced slowing in demand for our wire bonders in our fourth quarter of fiscal and we anticipate further slowing in demand for our wire bonders in the first fiscal quarter of there can be no assurances regarding the level of demand for our products  and in any case  we believe the historical volatility both upward and downward will persist 
any downturn may be more severe and prolonged than those experienced in the past 
downturns adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may experience increasing price pressure our historical business strategy for many of our products has focused on product performance and customer service more than on price 
the length and severity of the most recent economic downturn increased cost pressures on our customers and we have observed increasing price sensitivity on their part 
in response  we are actively seeking to reduce our cost structure by moving operations to lower cost areas and by reducing other operating costs 
if we are unable to realize prices that allow us to continue to compete on the basis of performance and service  our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future in the past  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly  we expect that they will continue to fluctuate 
although these fluctuations are partly due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry  they also reflect other factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause our revenues and or operating margins to fluctuate significantly from period to period are market downturns  the mix of products that we sell because  for example our test division has lower margins than assembly equipment and packaging materials  some lines of equipment within our business segments are more profitable than others  and some sales arrangements have higher margins than others  the volume and timing of orders for our products and any order postponements  virtually all of our orders are subject to cancellation  deferral or rescheduling by the customer without prior notice and with limited or no penalties  changes in our pricing  or that of our competitors  higher than anticipated costs of development or production of new equipment models  the availability and cost of the components for our products  unanticipated delays in the introduction of our new products and upgraded versions of our products and market acceptance of these products when introduced  customers delay in purchasing our products due to customer anticipation that we or our competitors may introduce new or upgraded products  and our competitors introduction of new products 
many of our expenses  such as research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense  do not vary directly with our net sales 
as a result  a decline in our net sales would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we were to incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we did not experience comparable increased net sales  our operating results would decline 
in a downturn  we may have excess inventory  which is required to be written off 
some of the other factors that may cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  severance  resizing and the costs of relocating or closing down facilities  inventory write offs due to obsolescence  and inflationary increases in the cost of labor or materials 
because our revenues and operating results are volatile and difficult to predict  we believe that consecutive period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 

table of contents we may not be able to rapidly develop  manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business we believe that our continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we must timely introduce these products and product enhancements into the market in response to customers demands for higher performance assembly equipment  leading edge materials and for test interconnect solutions customized to address rapid technological advances in integrated circuits and capital equipment designs 
our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer performance  features and lower prices that may render our products less competitive 
the development and commercialization of new products requires significant capital expenditures over an extended period of time  and some products that we seek to develop may never become profitable 
in addition  we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner that will satisfy our customers future needs or achieve market acceptance 
most of our sales and a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the united states  and we rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain product lines  all of which subject us to risks from changes in trade regulations  currency fluctuations  political instability and war approximately of our net sales for fiscal  of our net sales for fiscal and of our net sales for fiscal were attributable to sales to customers for delivery outside of the united states  in particular to customers in the asia pacific region 
we expect this trend to continue 
thus  our future performance will depend  in significant part  on our ability to continue to compete in foreign markets  particularly in asia pacific 
these economies have been highly volatile  resulting in significant fluctuation in local currencies  and political and economic instability 
these conditions may continue or worsen  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we also rely on non united states suppliers for materials and components used in our products  and most of our manufacturing operations are located in countries other than the united states 
we manufacture our automatic ball bonders and bonding wire in singapore  capillaries in israel and china  bonding wire in switzerland  test products in taiwan  china  france  and scotland and we have sales  service and support personnel in china  hong kong  japan  korea  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan and europe 
we also rely on independent foreign distribution channels for certain of our product lines 
as a result  a major portion of our business is subject to the risks associated with international  and particularly asia pacific  commerce  such as terrorism  war and civil disturbances or other events that may limit or disrupt markets  expropriation of our foreign assets  longer payment cycles in foreign markets  international exchange restrictions  restrictions on the repatriation of our assets  including cash  possible disagreements with tax authorities regarding transfer pricing regulations  the difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations  episodic events outside our control such as  for example  the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  tariff and currency fluctuations  changing political conditions  
table of contents labor conditions and costs  foreign governments monetary policies and regulatory requirements  less protective foreign intellectual property laws  and legal systems which are less developed and which may be less predictable than those in the united states 
because most of our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars  an increase in value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies  particularly the japanese yen  will make our products more expensive than those offered by some of our foreign competitors 
our ability to compete overseas in the future may be materially and adversely affected by a strengthening of the united states dollar against foreign currencies 
because we have significant assets  including cash  outside the united states  those assets are subject to risks of seizure  and it may be difficult to repatriate them  or repatriation may result in the payment by us of significant united states taxes 
our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the united states and those foreign countries in which our customers  subcontractors  and materials suppliers have operations 
a protectionist trade environment in either the united states or those foreign countries in which we do business  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance or other trade policies  may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
in addition  any change to existing united states laws or the enactment of new laws penalizing united states companies for reducing the number of united states based employees and hiring more employees in foreign countries may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may not be able to consolidate manufacturing facilities without incurring unanticipated costs and disruptions to our business in an effort to further reduce our cost structure  we have initiated a process of closing some of our manufacturing facilities and expanding others 
we may incur significant and unexpected costs  delays and disruptions to our business during this consolidation process 
because of unanticipated events  including the actions of governments  employees or customers  we may not realize the synergies  cost reductions and other benefits of any consolidation to the extent or within the timeframe that we currently expect 
our business depends on attracting and retaining management  marketing and technical employees as with many other technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  marketing and technical employees 
in particular  we periodically experience shortages of engineers 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain the managerial  marketing and technical personnel we require  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
difficulties in forecasting demand for our product lines may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excesses we typically operate our business with a relatively short backlog 
as a result  we sometimes experience inventory shortages or excesses 
we generally order supplies and otherwise plan our production based on internal forecasts of demand 
we have in the past  and may again in the future  fail to forecast accurately demand for our products  in terms of both volume and configuration for either our current or next generation wire bonders 
this has led to and may in the future lead to delays in product shipments or  alternatively  an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
if we fail to forecast accurately demand for our products  including assembly equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
advanced packaging technologies other than wire bonding may render some of our products obsolete advanced packaging technologies have emerged that may improve device performance or reduce the size of an integrated circuit package  as compared to traditional die and wire bonding 
these technologies include flip chip and chip scale packaging 
some of these advanced technologies eliminate the need for wires to establish the electrical connection between a die and its package 
the semiconductor industry may  in the future  shift a significant part of its volume into 
table of contents advanced packaging technologies  such as those discussed above  which do not employ our products 
if a significant shift to advanced packaging technologies were to occur  demand for our wire bonders and related packaging materials may be materially and adversely affected 
because a small number of customers account for most of our sales  our revenues could decline if we lose a significant customer the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and their subcontract assemblers and vertically integrated manufacturers of electronic systems purchasing a substantial portion of our semiconductor assembly equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions 
sales to a relatively small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our net sales 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  sales to advanced semiconductor engineering  our largest customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we expect that sales of our products to a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
thus  our business success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with our important customers 
any one of a number of factors could adversely affect these relationships 
if  for example  during periods of escalating demand for our equipment  we were unable to add inventory and production capacity quickly enough to meet the needs of our customers  they may turn to other suppliers making it more difficult for us to retain their business 
similarly  if we are unable for any other reason to meet production or delivery schedules  particularly during a period of escalating demand  our relationships with our key customers could be adversely affected 
if we lose orders from a significant customer  or if a significant customer reduces its orders substantially  these losses or reductions may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for raw materials  components and subassemblies 
if our suppliers do not deliver their products to us  we would be unable to deliver our products to our customers our products are complex and require raw materials  components and subassemblies having a high degree of reliability  accuracy and performance 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of these components and subassemblies and we rely on sole source suppliers for some important components and raw materials  including gold 
as a result  we are exposed to a number of significant risks  including lack of control over the manufacturing process for components and subassemblies  changes in our manufacturing processes  in response to changes in the market  which may delay our shipments  our inadvertent use of defective or contaminated raw materials  the relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources of some of our suppliers  which may limit their ability to manufacture and sell subassemblies  components or parts in the volumes we require and at acceptable quality levels and prices  reliability or quality problems with certain key subassemblies provided by single source suppliers as to which we may not have any short term alternative  shortages caused by disruptions at our suppliers and subcontractors for a variety of reasons  including work stoppage or fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters  delays in the delivery of raw materials or subassemblies  which  in turn  may delay our shipments  and the loss of suppliers as a result of the consolidation of suppliers in the industry 
if we are unable to deliver products to our customers on time for these or any other reasons  if we are unable to meet customer expectations as to cycle time  or if we do not maintain acceptable product quality or reliability  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents our test division and our diversification presents significant management and operating challenges during fiscal  we acquired two companies that design and manufacture test interconnect solutions  cerprobe corporation and probe technology corporation  and combined their operations to create our test division 
since its acquisition in  this division has not performed to our expectations 
problems have included difficulties in rationalizing duplicate products and facilities  and in integrating these acquisitions 
our plan to correct these problems centers on the following steps standardize production processes between the various test manufacturing sites  create and ramp production of our highest volume products in a new lower cost site in china and or outsource production where appropriate  then rationalize excess capacity by converting existing higher cost  low volume manufacturing sites to service centers 
if we are unable to successfully implement this plan  our operating margins and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected by the performance of our test division 
more generally  our diversification strategy has increased demands on our management  financial resources and information and internal control systems 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to manage and integrate our test division and our equipment and packaging materials businesses and to continue successfully to implement  improve and expand our systems  procedures and controls 
if we fail to integrate our businesses successfully or to develop the necessary internal procedures to manage diversified businesses  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may from time to time in the future seek to expand our business through acquisition 
in that event  the success of any such acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate and finance on acceptable terms the acquisition 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions industries the semiconductor equipment  packaging materials and test interconnect solutions industries are very competitive 
in the semiconductor equipment and test interconnect solutions markets  significant competitive factors include performance  quality  customer support and price 
in the semiconductor packaging materials industry  competitive factors include price  delivery and quality 
in each of our markets  we face competition and the threat of competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  some of which have or may have significantly greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
some of these competitors are asian and european companies that have had and may continue to have an advantage over us in supplying products to local customers who appear to prefer to purchase from local suppliers  without regard to other considerations 
we expect our competitors to improve their current products performance  and to introduce new products and materials with improved price and performance characteristics 
our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to or better than ours 
new product and materials introductions by our competitors or by new market entrants could hurt our sales 
if a particular semiconductor manufacturer or subcontract assembler selects a competitor s product or materials for a particular assembly operation  we may not be able to sell products or materials to that manufacturer or assembler for a significant period of time because manufacturers and assemblers sometimes develop lasting relations with suppliers  and assembly equipment in our industry often goes years without requiring replacement 
in addition  we may have to lower our prices in response to price cuts by our competitors  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete in these or other areas in the future 
if we cannot compete successfully  we could be forced to reduce prices  and could lose customers and market share and experience reduced margins and profitability 
our success depends in part on our intellectual property  which we may be unable to protect our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
to protect this technology  we rely principally on contractual restrictions such as nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions in our agreements with employees  subcontractors  
table of contents vendors  consultants and customers and on the common law of trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we also rely  in some cases  on patent and copyright protection 
we may not be successful in protecting our technology for a number of reasons  including the following employees  subcontractors  vendors  consultants and customers may violate their contractual agreements  and the cost of enforcing those agreements may be prohibitive  or those agreements may be unenforceable or more limited than we anticipate  foreign intellectual property laws may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our patent and copyright claims may not be sufficiently broad to effectively protect our technology  our patents or copyrights may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or we may otherwise be unable to obtain adequate protection for our technology 
in addition  our partners and alliances may also have rights to technology that we develop 
we may incur significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be weakened 
third parties may claim we are infringing on their intellectual property  which could cause us to incur significant litigation costs or other expenses  or prevent us from selling some of our products the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  with frequent introductions of new products and technologies 
industry participants often develop products and features similar to those introduced by others  creating a risk that their products and processes may give rise to claims that they infringe on the intellectual property of others 
we may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and incur significant liability for that infringement 
if we are found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others  we could be enjoined from continuing to manufacture  market or use the affected product  or be required to obtain a license to continue manufacturing or using the affected product 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing or re engineering our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly  impractical or time consuming 
occasionally  third parties assert that we are  or may be  infringing on or misappropriating their intellectual property rights 
in these cases  we will defend against claims or negotiate licenses where we consider these actions appropriate 
intellectual property cases are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if we become involved in this type of litigation  it could consume significant resources and divert our attention from our business 
some of our customers are parties to litigation brought by the lemelson medical  education and research foundation limited partnership lemelson  in which lemelson claims that certain manufacturing processes used by those customers infringe patents held by lemelson 
we have never been named a party to any such litigation 
some customers have requested that we indemnify them to the extent their liability for these claims arises from use of our equipment 
we do not believe that products sold by us infringe valid lemelson patents 
if a claim for contribution were to be brought against us  we believe we would have valid defenses to assert and also would have rights to contribution and claims against our suppliers 
we have not incurred any material liability with respect to the lemelson claims or any other pending intellectual property claim to date and we do not believe that these claims will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the ultimate outcome of any infringement or misappropriation claim that might be made  however  is uncertain and we cannot assure you that the resolution of any such claim would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may be materially and adversely affected by environmental and safety laws and regulations we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  storage  use  emission  discharge  transportation and disposal of hazardous material  investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and the health and safety of our employees 
increasingly  public attention has focused on the environmental impact of manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations 

table of contents proper waste disposal plays an important role in the operation of our manufacturing plants 
in many of our facilities we maintain wastewater treatment systems that remove metals and other contaminants from process wastewater 
these facilities operate under permits that must be renewed periodically 
a violation of those permits may lead to revocation of the permits  fines  penalties or the incurrence of capital or other costs to comply with the permits  including potential shutdown of operations 
in the future  existing or new land use and environmental regulations may impose upon us the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements  restrict our ability to expand our operations  subject us to liability for  among other matters  remediation  and or cause us to curtail our operations 
we cannot assure you that any costs or liabilities associated with complying with these environmental laws will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have significant intangible assets and goodwill  which we are required to evaluate annually in fiscal and  we recorded substantial write downs of goodwill 
however  our financial statements continue to reflect significant intangible assets and goodwill 
we are required to perform an impairment test at least annually to support the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
should we be required to recognize additional intangible or goodwill impairment charges  our financial condition would be adversely affected 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  and under pennsylvania law may discourage other companies from attempting to acquire us some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of pennsylvania law may discourage some transactions where we would otherwise experience a fundamental change 
for example  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that classify our board of directors into four classes  with one class being elected each year  permit our board to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval  and prohibit us from engaging in some types of business combinations with a holder of or more of our voting securities without super majority board or stockholder approval 
further  under the pennsylvania business corporation law  because our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  stockholders may remove directors only for cause 
these provisions and some other provisions of the pennsylvania business corporation law could delay  defer or prevent us from experiencing a fundamental change and may adversely affect our common stockholders voting and other rights 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   or other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate and our profitability terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
our primary facilities include administrative  sales and r d facilities in the united states and manufacturing facilities in the united states  israel  singapore and china 
also  these attacks have disrupted the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels for all of our facilities 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect the sales of our products in the united states and overseas 
the existing conflicts in afghanistan and iraq  and particularly in israel  where we maintain a manufacturing facility  or any broader conflict  could have a further impact on our domestic and international sales  our supply chain  our production capability and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of any of these armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or your investment 

table of contents we may be unable to generate enough cash to service our debt our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other activities will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
if our convertible debt is not converted to our common shares  we will be required to make annual cash interest payments of million in each of fiscal years through  thousand in fiscal and thousand in fiscal on our aggregate million of convertible subordinated debt 
principal payments of million and million on the convertible subordinated debt are due in fiscal and  respectively 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness is affected by the volatile nature of our business  and general economic  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
our indebtedness poses risks to our business  including that we must use a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  product development and other general corporate purposes  insufficient cash flow from operations may force us to sell assets  or seek additional capital  which we may be unable to do at all or on terms favorable to us  and our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash in an amount sufficient to enable us to service interest  principal and other payments on our debt  including the notes  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we are not restricted under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness from incurring additional debt in the future 
if new debt is added to our current levels  our leverage and our debt service obligations would increase and the related risks described above could intensify 
changes in stock option accounting rules may adversely impact our reported operating results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
we have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to hire  incentivize and retain our workforce 
currently  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income of using the fair value recognition method 
we have elected to apply apb and accordingly  we do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb concluded that sfas no 
r  share based payment  will be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  under sfas no 
r  companies must measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  using a fair value based method and these payments must be recognized as expenses in our statements of operations 
the implementation of sfas no 
r beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal will have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations because we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock options rather than disclosing the impact on results of operations within our footnotes in accordance with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this will result in lower reported earnings per share  which could negatively impact our future stock price 
in addition  this could negatively impact our ability to utilize employee stock plans to recruit and retain employees and could result in a competitive disadvantage to us in the employee marketplace
