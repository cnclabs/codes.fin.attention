item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of future results 
overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of medical systems based on our helinx technology 
we have been unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for the intercept blood system for platelets  which is approved for sale in europe  all of our product candidates are in the research and development stage  and we have not received significant revenue to date from product sales 
we must conduct significant research  development  pre clinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities on these product candidates that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after commercialization of additional products 
our ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on our ability to successfully complete development and obtain additional regulatory approvals and on baxter s ability to commercialize and achieve market acceptance of the intercept blood system 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
further  under the agreements discussed below  baxter provides significant funding for development of the intercept blood system  based on an annual budgeting process  and is responsible for manufacturing and marketing the products following regulatory approvals 
these agreements may be modified or terminated 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to collaborative arrangements  contract research and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  external laboratory studies and development activities performed by baxter  for research and development services performed 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue and research and development expenses revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the project are incurred 
revenue related to at risk milestones specified under development contracts is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
license fees and payments for achieved milestones are non refundable and are not subject to future performance 
we receive certain united states government grants that support our research effort in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
investments we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents consist principally of short term money market instruments and commercial paper 
we have classified all debt securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
accrued liabilities we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  external laboratory studies and development activities performed by baxter  for research and development services performed 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
loan and interest payable to a related party baxter capital has commenced legal proceedings against us seeking immediate repayment of amounts outstanding under a loan to us 
we do not agree with baxter capital s allegation that a default has occurred and therefore believe that under the terms of the loan  no principal or interest payments are due until january we have recorded interest expense based on a per annum interest rate 
if we are unsuccessful in defending the action by baxter capital  then we could be liable for additional interest and penalties 
due to the uncertainty of the outcome of the loan dispute with baxter capital  we have classified the loan and accrued interest balance as a current liability 
baxter capital has instructed baxter to remit to baxter capital payments owing to us for revenue sharing on platelet product sales 
we have accounted for amounts paid to baxter capital by baxter on our behalf as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
collaborations agreement with baxter for the development of the intercept blood system for platelets 
we have a development and commercialization agreement with baxter for the joint development of the intercept blood system for inactivation of viruses  bacteria and other infectious pathogens in platelets used for transfusion 
this agreement provides for baxter and us to generally share system development costs equally  subject to mutually determined budgets established from time to time  and for us to receive approximately of revenue from sales of inactivation system disposables after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods to the extent the cost exceeds specific amounts 
baxter has an exclusive  worldwide distribution license and is responsible for manufacturing and marketing the intercept blood system for platelets 
this agreement expires in december and provides for both parties to make good faith efforts to negotiate one or more three year renewals unless either party provides written notice of termination no later than months prior to the expiration date 
agreement with baxter for the development of the intercept blood system for red blood cells and intercept blood system for plasma 
we also have a development and commercialization agreement with baxter for the joint development of the intercept blood system to inactivate viruses  bacteria and other infectious pathogens in red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma for transfusion 
this agreement provides for baxter and us generally to share red blood cell system development costs equally  subject to mutually determined budgets established from time to time 
we are solely responsible for funding the development costs of the intercept blood system for plasma 
baxter has an exclusive  worldwide distribution license and will be responsible for manufacturing and marketing the intercept blood system for red blood cells and intercept blood system for plasma following regulatory approvals 
the agreement also provides for an equal sharing of revenue from sales of red blood cell system disposables  and for us to receive and baxter to receive of revenue from sales of plasma system disposables  in each case after each party is reimbursed for its cost of goods and a specified percentage  not to exceed of revenue  is retained by baxter for marketing and administrative expenses 
the termination of phase iii clinical trials of the red blood cell system does not affect the terms of the agreement and is not expected to affect current sources of development funding revenue  but will significantly delay the development of  and any potential revenue from  sales of the red blood cell system 
funding from baxter 
as of december   we have received million in equity investments from baxter and million in an equity investment from baxter international inc and subsidiaries pension trust  have received proceeds from a million loan from baxter capital and have recognized approximately million in milestone and development funding revenue from baxter  since inception 
baxter has advised us that baxter international inc and subsidiaries pension trust is not an affiliate of baxter 
baxter capital has commenced legal proceedings against us seeking immediate repayment of amounts outstanding under the loan 
baxter capital alleges that changes in our business constitute a default under the terms of the loan 
cooperative agreement with the armed forces of the united states 
in february  we were awarded a million cooperative agreement by the army medical research acquisition activity division of the department of defense 
in september and may  we were awarded additional million and million cooperative agreements  respectively  both of which were awarded to continue funding of projects to develop our pathogen inactivation technologies to improve the safety and availability of blood that may be used by the united states armed forces for medical transfusions 
under the conditions of the agreements  we are conducting research on the inactivation of infectious pathogens  including unusual viruses  bacteria and parasites  which are of particular concern to the armed forces 
we are collaborating with investigators at walter reed army institute of research to investigate ways to improve the storage and shelf life of blood and blood components  which may be used for medical transfusion support in combat zones  and a portion of the funding we receive is used by us to fund this research 
agreement with kirin 
in january  we entered into a collaborative agreement with the pharmaceutical division of kirin to develop and market products for stem cell transplantation based on our helinx technology 
under the terms of the agreement  we will jointly develop the products with kirin 
we received an initial license fee of million 
the license fee is being deferred and recognized as development funding ratably over the development period 
we may not receive additional funding from kirin 
although the agreement calls for kirin to fund all development expenses for the asia pacific region and a portion of our development activities aimed at obtaining product approval in the united states  no such development activities co funded by kirin are currently ongoing 
upon product approval  kirin has exclusive rights to market the products in the asia pacific region  including japan  china  korea and australia  and we will receive a specified share of product revenue  including a royalty and reimbursement of our cost of goods 
we retain all marketing rights for the rest of the world  including the united states and europe 
agreement with the national marrow donor program 
in october  we entered into an agreement with the national marrow donor program  or nmdp  a non profit corporation  under which the nmdp sponsors a clinical trial of our allogeneic cellular immune therapy in patients receiving matched unrelated bone marrow transplants 
the agreement was amended in december under the amended agreement  we provide our helinx compound amotosalen  illumination devices  training of clinical sites and program oversight in exchange for reimbursement by the nmdp of our related costs 
we recognized  in development funding from the nmdp in the year ended december  the amended agreement expires on march  results of operations compared with revenue 
for the year ended december   milestone and development funding from related parties decreased to million from million for amounts recognized in were from baxter for development of the intercept blood system for platelets  whereas in a million milestone payment from baxter was earned upon regulatory approval of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
development funding is in the form of balancing payments made by baxter to us  if necessary  to reimburse us for development spending in excess of the levels determined by baxter and us 
in  we expect to recognize development funding totaling less than million from baxter for both the platelet and red blood cell programs 
development funding from baxter was of total revenue for development funding from other sources  which includes kirin and the nmdp  decreased to million for from million for revenue recognized from kirin in was from the up front payment that was deferred and recognized ratably over the development period 
there is no development activity co funded by kirin currently ongoing or planned at cerus 
the current agreement with the nmdp expires on march  if the agreement with the nmdp is renewed  development funding to cerus  if any  may be less than under the existing agreement 
development funding from the nmdp was of total revenue for development funding from kirin was of total revenue for revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million for from million for the increase was principally due to a million increase in program expenditures under the cooperative agreements with the armed forces of the united states  most of this increase supporting research and development applicable to the intercept blood system 
during  we also recognized million of revenue from six separate research grants from the national institutes of health 
two of these grants expired in and the rest expire in we may not receive additional government grants in the future 
we recognized  and  of product sales revenue in and  respectively  from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
as a result of the loan dispute with baxter capital  recognition of product sales revenue in the amount of  for the fourth quarter of has been deferred until payment of such revenue is expected to be collected 
we do not expect to recognize any further product sales revenue until the loan dispute with baxter capital is resolved and we cannot predict when this will occur 
the intercept blood system for platelets is currently undergoing validation studies and regulatory reimbursement review in many european countries 
we do not expect sales of the system in europe to be significant at least until the system is approved for sale and reimbursement in the larger market european countries 
we expect that underlying product sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe in will continue to increase  however  we do not expect potential product sales revenue in  if recognizable  to be sufficient for us to achieve a level of profitable operations 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for scientific personnel  payments to consultants  supplies and chemicals used in in house laboratories  costs of research and development facilities  depreciation of equipment and external contract research expenses  including clinical trials  pre clinical safety studies  compound manufacturing and other laboratory studies 
research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease was due primarily to reduced development spending at baxter and also to the termination of phase iii clinical trials in the red blood cell program in september our total research and development costs included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for  and million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for we anticipate that our research and development expenses will decrease primarily as a result of the restructuring of our operations relating to the termination of red blood cell system phase iii clinical trials  which included a reduction in workforce of approximately in october ongoing expenses relating to the termination of the red blood cell phase iii clinical trials will be recognized as incurred in and will be significantly lower than expenses in in the longer term  we anticipate that our research and development expenses may increase if an additional united states clinical trial of the intercept blood system for platelets is conducted  and as development is completed for the intercept blood system for plasma and research and development activity relating to other clinical and pre clinical programs increases 
due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical products  including but not limited to intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of future pre clinical and clinical study results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects  see risk factors above 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for the slight decrease was principally attributable to fewer administrative personnel and consultants in we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease slightly in as a result of our restructuring  due to the reduction in workforce in october in the longer term  we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase moderately as development and commercialization activities progress 
net interest income expense 
net interest expense was million for compared to net interest income of million for we received proceeds from a million loan from baxter capital in january and recorded million of related interest expense in interest income from investments was million for compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to reduced yields on investments as a result of declines in market interest rates 
we expect to earn interest at market rates in proportion to the balances we maintain 
compared with revenue 
for the year ended december   milestone and development funding from baxter and the consortium increased to million from million for the increase was due to a million milestone payment from baxter earned in upon regulatory approval of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
development funding from baxter was of total revenue for development funding from the consortium was less than of total revenue for development funding from other sources  which includes kirin and the nmdp  decreased to million for from million for the decrease was due to a million decrease in development funding from kirin in development funding from the nmdp was of total revenue for development funding from kirin was of total revenue for revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million for from million for the increase was principally due to a million increase in program expenditures under the cooperative agreements with the armed forces of the united states that were entered into in february and september during  we also recognized revenue under a grant from the national institutes of health that expired in july we recognized  of product sales revenue in from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was due primarily to the addition of scientific personnel  increased facilities costs and increased development spending at baxter 
our total research and development costs incurred included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for  and million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs for general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was principally attributable to the addition of administrative personnel  increased costs for insurance and increased facilities expenses associated with expansion of our operations 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to reduced investment balances carried in and less favorable yields on investments as a result of declining interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of capital to date have primarily consisted of public offerings and private placements of equity securities  the loan from baxter capital  payments received under our agreements with baxter  kirin  the nmdp and the consortium  united states government grants and cooperative agreements and interest income 
to date  we have not received significant revenue from product sales  and we will not derive significant revenue from product sales unless and until one or more products receive regulatory approval and achieve market acceptance 
as a result of the loan dispute with baxter capital  recognition of product sales revenue in the amount of  for the fourth quarter of has been deferred 
we do not expect to recognize any further product sales revenue until the loan dispute with baxter capital is resolved and we cannot predict when this will occur 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million in the use of cash primarily resulted from a net loss of million and changes in other operating balances  including accrued interest of million 
net cash used in investing activities in of million resulted principally from the purchases of million of short term investments and the purchase of million of furniture and equipment  offset by the sales and maturities of million of short term investments 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to million of net cash used in operating activities for and the classification of million of loan and accrued interest payable to baxter capital as current liabilities as of december  due to uncertainty as to the potential outcome of legal proceedings  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the loan in january and million from the public offering of common stock in june we believe that our available cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from existing development and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements until at least december  irrespective of the timing of repayment of any amounts due under the loan from baxter capital 
these near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including the development progress and costs of the intercept blood system and other programs  payments to or from baxter and the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property position 
our long term capital requirements will be dependent on these factors and on the outcome of the loan dispute with baxter capital whereby baxter capital is seeking immediate repayment of outstanding principal  interest and default penalties totaling million as of december   the outcome of ongoing securities class action and derivative lawsuits against us  our ability to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of the intercept blood system and other product candidates  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
if baxter were to terminate its agreements with us  we might not be able to meet our long term capital requirements 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to our investors  and may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
in august  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to offer and sell up to million of common stock and or debt securities 
in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock with gross proceeds  calculated for registration statement purposes  of million under the shelf registration statement 
we have no current commitments to offer or sell additional securities pursuant to this registration statement 
commitments our commitments are as follows payments due by period from december  total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations loan and interest payable to a related party   minimum purchase requirements capital lease obligations operating leases    total contractual cash obligations    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  if material 
unrealized gains and losses at december  and were not material 
our investments primarily consist of short term money market mutual funds  united states government obligations and commercial paper 
we do not believe our exposure to interest rate risk to be material given the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
the table below presents the amortized principal amount  which approximates fair value  and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at december  amortized principal amount weighted average interest rate in thousands cash equivalents  short term investments days year  short term investments years  total investments
