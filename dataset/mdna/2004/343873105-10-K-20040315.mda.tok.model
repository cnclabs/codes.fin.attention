item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general flushing financial corporation holding company  a delaware corporation  is the parent holding company for flushing savings bank  fsb bank  a federally chartered stock savings bank 
the bank was organized in as a new york state chartered mutual savings bank 
in  the bank converted to a federally chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name from flushing savings bank to flushing savings bank  fsb 
the bank converted to a federally chartered stock savings bank in as a federal savings bank  the bank s primary regulator is the office of thrift supervision ots 
the bank s deposits are insured to the maximum allowable amount by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the bank owns three subsidiaries flushing preferred funding corporation  flushing service corporation  and fsb properties inc the holding company also owns a special purpose business trust  flushing financial capital trust i trust 
during the third quarter of  the holding company issued million of floating rate capital securities through the trust 
these securities are included in borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations includes the collective results of the holding company  the trust and the bank collectively  the company  but reflects principally the bank s activities 
management views the company as operating as a single unit  a community savings bank 
therefore  segment information is not provided 
overview the company s principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in originations and purchases of one to four family focusing on mixed use properties properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units  multi family residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans  mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage backed securities  and us government and federal agency backed securities  corporate fixed income securities and other marketable securities 
to a lesser extent  the company originates certain other loans  including construction loans  small business administration loans and other small business loans 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its loan and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds  consisting primarily of interest paid on deposit accounts and borrowed funds 
net interest income is the result of the company s interest rate margin  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and the average balance of interest earning assets compared to the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the company also generates non interest income from loan fees  service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage servicing fees  and other fees  income earned on bank owned life insurance boli  dividends on federal home bank of new york fhlb ny stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans 
the company s operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense 
the company s results of operations also can be significantly affected by its periodic provision for loan losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned 
however  the company has not recorded a provision since management strategy 
management s strategy is to continue the bank s focus as a consumer oriented institution serving its local markets 
in furtherance of this objective  the company intends to continue its emphasis on the origination of one to four family mixed use property  multi family residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans  maintain asset quality  manage deposit growth and maintain a low cost of funds  manage interest rate risk  explore new business opportunities  and manage capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively implement this strategy 
the company s strategy is subject to change by the board of directors 
one to four family  multi family residential and commercial real estate lending 
in recent years  the company has emphasized the origination of higher yielding mortgage loan products 
market interest rates on one to four family residential mortgage loans remained at their lowest levels in over years during as a result  many borrowers sought to refinance their mortgages due to the low interest rate environment 
the company has not actively pursued this refinance market due to the low interest rate environment 
instead  the company has focused its origination efforts on higher yielding multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
the company expects to continue this emphasis on higher yielding mortgage loan products 
the following table shows loan originations and purchases during  and loan balances as of december  loan originations and purchases loan balances december  percent of gross loans dollars in thousands multi family residential commercial real estate one to four family mixed use properties one to four family residential construction co operative apartments other loans total the company s increased emphasis on multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans has increased the overall level of credit risk inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the greater risk associated with one to four family mixed use property  multi family and commercial real estate loans could require the company to increase its provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained by the company 
to date  the company has not experienced significant losses in its multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loan portfolios  and has determined that  at this time  additional provisions are not required 
maintain asset quality 
by adherence to its strict underwriting standards the bank has been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans with net charge offs of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has maintained the strength of its loan portfolio  as evidenced by the company s ratio of its allowance for loan losses to non performing loans of and at december  and  respectively 
the company seeks to maintain its loans in performing status through  among other things  strict collection efforts  and consistently monitors non performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status 
to this end  management reviews the quality of loans and reports to the loan committee of the board of directors of the bank on a monthly basis 
from time to time  the company has sold and may continue to make sales of non performing assets 
during  the bank sold million of non performing loans 
the bank did not incur any losses in connection with these sales 
non performing assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were and at december  and  respectively 
managing deposit growth and maintaining low cost of funds 
the company has a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from its market area through its eleven full service offices 
although the company seeks to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers  the company also seeks to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and its strategic plan 
management intends to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies 
the company generally relies on its deposit base as its principal source of funding 
however  the bank is also a member of the fhlb ny  which provides it with an additional source of borrowing 
these borrowings help the company fund asset growth and increase net interest income 
during  the company realized an increase in due to depositors of million and an increase in borrowed funds of million 
managing interest rate risk 
the company seeks to manage its interest rate risk by actively reviewing the repricing and maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the mix of loans originated by the company fixed or arm is determined in large part by borrowers preferences and prevailing market conditions 
the company seeks to manage the interest rate risk of the loan portfolio by actively managing its security portfolio and borrowings 
by adjusting the mix of fixed and adjustable rate securities  as well as the maturities of the securities  the company has the ability to manage the combined interest rate sensitivity of its assets 
see interest rate sensitivity analysis 
additionally  the company seeks to balance the interest rate sensitivity of its assets by managing the maturities of its liabilities 
during  in response to the lowest interest rates in over years  the bank renewed existing borrowings  and obtained new borrowings  with fixed rate terms from three to six years to lock in these low rates 
management believes that the interest rate exposure of the company has been reduced by extending the terms of these borrowings 
exploring new business opportunities 
the company has in the past increased growth through acquisitions of financial institutions and branches of other financial institutions  and will continue to pursue growth through acquisitions that are  or are expected to be within a reasonable time frame  accretive to earnings 
the company has also opened new branches  the most recent of which was opened in astoria  queens in october the company does not currently have plans to acquire another financial institution or open additional branches 
managing capital 
the bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by the ots 
these requirements limit the dividends the bank is allowed to pay to the holding company  and can limit the annual growth of the bank 
as part of the company s strategy to find ways to best utilize its available capital  during flushing financial corporation continued its stock repurchase programs by repurchasing  shares of its common stock 
also  during the fourth quarter of   shares of treasury stock were used to pay the stock dividend discussed below 
the company did not hold any treasury shares at december   and the number of outstanding shares was  at december    shares remain to be repurchased under the current stock repurchase program 
common stock split 
on november   the board of directors of the company declared a three for two stock split of the company s common stock in the form of a stock dividend  which was paid on december  each stockholder received one additional share for every two shares of the company s common stock held at the record date  december  cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares 
the company issued  shares of its common stock  of which  shares had been held as treasury stock 
all share and per share amounts in this annual report have been restated to reflect this three for two stock split paid on december  trends and contingencies 
the company s operating results are significantly affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions  including changes in market interest rates  the strength of the local economy  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
interest rates remained low during  and at december  were at their lowest level in over years 
we remained strategically focused in on the origination of multi family residential  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
as a result of this strategy  we were able to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio then we would have otherwise experienced 
prevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans 
in a declining interest rate environment  such as that experienced in recent years  the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancings tends to increase  as do prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
call provisions associated with the company s investment in us government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment 
such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of the company s loan portfolio and mortgage backed and other securities as the company reinvests the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment 
however  the company typically receives additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced  which partially offsets the reduced yield on the company s loan portfolio resulting from prepayments 
in periods of low interest rates  the company s level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher yielding instruments or other investments not offered by the company  which in turn may increase the company s cost of funds and decrease its net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources are utilized 
by contrast  an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities  which could adversely affect net interest income 
in addition  depositors tend to open longer term  higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect the bank s net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline 
additionally  adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at repricing dates 
during  the company experienced many of the trends associated with a declining interest rate environment discussed above 
many of the bank s mortgagors chose to refinance their loans 
we saw a significant increase in our mortgagors refinancing with other institutions 
however  contrary to the trends discussed above  we saw an increase in due to depositors of million during management believes that the increase in due to depositors is attributed in part to the bank s marketing efforts  which focused on rates offered on select deposit products 
combining the increase in deposits with higher than anticipated loan prepayments  we experienced an increase in our cash position 
rather than investing these funds in low yielding long term investment securities  we invested these funds in readily marketable mortgage backed securities and shorter term investment securities to provide readily available funding for loan originations 
other securities primarily consists of securities issued by government agencies and mutual or bond funds that invest in government and government agency securities 
at december   we had loans in process of million 
for the year ended december   certificate of deposits increased million while lower costing deposits increased million 
during  borrowed funds increased million  primarily due to a leveraging strategy implemented in june in which we borrowed million from the fhlb ny and invested the proceeds in mortgage backed securities with an initial spread of basis points 
as a result of the declining interest rate environment experienced during the past three years  and the increase in lower costing deposits  we experienced a decrease in our cost of funds in each quarter during the cost of funds declined to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of as a result of the low interest rate environment during the past three years  the yield on our total interest earning assets declined basis points during from this was more than offset by a basis point decline in the cost of our total interest bearing liabilities 
this resulted in an increase of basis points in the net interest spread to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the net interest rate margin improved one basis point to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the net interest margin improved to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of we are unable to predict the direction of future interest rate changes 
should interest rates increase during  we could see a reversal of some the trends we experienced in we could see an increase in the cost of our existing deposit accounts and in obtaining new funds 
however  approximately of the company s certificates of deposit accounts and borrowed funds do not reprice or mature during the next year 
as a result  the average cost of our interest bearing liabilities may not immediately reflect the full effect of an increasing interest rate environment 
also  in an increasing interest rate environment  mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities with lower rates do not usually prepay as quickly 
a reduction in the level of our mortgagors refinancing their loans would reduce prepayment penalties we receive  resulting in a reduction in the yield on our mortgage portfolio and net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  this could result in our cost of funds increasing more than the yield on our interest earning assets 
during  the nation s economy was generally considered to be expanding 
yet  world events  particularly the war on terror  the war in iraq  and the u 
s 
dollar s decline against other currencies  as well as slow job growth  continued to have an effect on the economic recovery 
these economic conditions can result in borrowers defaulting on their loans  or withdrawing their funds on deposit at the bank to meet their financial obligations 
while we have not seen a significant increase in delinquent loans  and have seen an increase in deposits  we cannot predict the effect of these economic conditions on the company s financial condition or operating results 
interest rate sensitivity analysis a financial institution s exposure to the risks of changing interest rates may be analyzed  in part  by examining the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
accordingly  a positive gap may enhance net interest income in a rising rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling rate environment 
conversely  a negative gap may enhance net interest income in a falling rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the table below sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans  other loans and mortgage backed securities are based on industry averages  which generally range from to  depending on the contractual rate of interest and the underlying collateral 
passbook and money market accounts were assumed to have a withdrawal or run off rate of  based on historical experience 
while management believes that these assumptions are indicative of actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by the company  there is no guarantee that these trends will continue in the future 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis at december  three months and less more than three months to one year more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years to ten years more than ten years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets mortgage loans other loans short term securities securities available for sale mortgage backed securities other total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities passbook accounts now accounts money market accounts certificate of deposit accounts mortgagors escrow deposits borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of cumulative interest earning assets consists of interest earning deposits and federal funds sold 
does not include non interest bearing demand accounts totaling million at december  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar estimated maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates and may bear rates that differ in varying degrees from the rates that would apply upon maturity and reinvestment or upon repricing 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a significant change in the level of interest rates  prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and deposit withdrawal or run off levels  would likely deviate materially from those assumed in calculating the above table 
in the event of an interest rate increase  some borrowers may be unable to meet the increased payments on their adjustable rate debt 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes that the nature of the company s assets and liabilities remains static 
interest rates may have an effect on customer preferences for deposits and loan products 
finally  the maturity and repricing characteristics of many assets and liabilities as set forth in the above table are not governed by contract but rather by management s best judgment based on current market conditions and anticipated business strategies 
interest rate risk the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of the company s interest earning assets which could adversely affect the company s results of operations if such assets were sold  or  in the case of securities classified as available for sale  decreases in the company s stockholders equity  if such securities were retained 
the company manages the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust its exposure to interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  management prepares the earnings and economic exposure to changes in interest rate report for review by the board of directors  as summarized below 
this report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down shocked basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
the ots currently places its focus on the net portfolio value ratio  focusing on a rate shock up or down of basis points 
the ots uses the change in net portfolio value ratio to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities 
the market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation 
the net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
at december   the company is within the guidelines established by the board of directors for each interest rate level

net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of financial condition and the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and  and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown

as a result of the increased net income before income taxes  there was a million increase in income tax expense 
the increase in non interest income was primarily attributed to a million pre tax impairment writedown of the bank s investment in a worldcom  inc senior note during the second quarter of excluding this impairment writedown  which on an after tax basis was million  net income for the year ended december  would have been million  and diluted earnings per share would have been

the yield on loans decreased basis points to during from during our focus on the origination of higher yielding multi family residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans  along with the origination of one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  allowed us to maintain a higher yield on our loan portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced  despite the declining interest rate environment experienced during the past three years 
the yield on mortgage loans reflects the high refinancing activity that occurred during the bank s existing borrowers have been refinancing their higher costing mortgage loans at the current lower rates  which has resulted in a decrease on the yield of the mortgage portfolio 
this decrease has been partially offset by prepayment penalties that have been collected 
a decrease in refinancing activity would result in a decrease in prepayment penalties collected by the bank  and would result in a decrease in the yield on the mortgage portfolio 
the increase in interest income from mortgage backed securities is due to a million increase in the average balances of mortgage backed securities for the year ended december  to million  partially offset by a basis point decline in the yield to during from during the increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities is partially due to a leveraging strategy implemented in june due to the attractive low rates available for medium term borrowings  the company borrowed million in june and invested the proceeds in mortgage backed securities with an initial spread of approximately basis points 
the decrease in interest and dividends on other securities and interest earning deposits and federal funds sold is due to a decrease their average balances and yield  as funds previously held in these categories were reinvested in higher yielding assets

there was no provision for loan losses for the years ended december  and in assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  management considers the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
based on these reviews  no provision for loan losses was deemed necessary for the years ended december  and the ratio of non performing loans to gross loans was at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses as percentage of non performing loans was and at december  and  respectively

the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  reconciliation of non gaap financial amounts and ratios the preceding discussions include comparisons to and for the year ended december  that included an after tax impairment writedown of million relating to the bank s investment in a worldcom  inc senior note 
comparisons were also made excluding this writedown for that year 
management believes that this impairment writedown was a one time event that is not likely to be repeated  and is therefore not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the company 
excluding this writedown  in our view  presents a better comparison of the company s ongoing operating results 
a reconciliation of amounts and financial ratios of the company as reported in its financial statements to the adjusted amounts and financial ratios  which exclude this impairment writedown  is shown below for the year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share data net income as reported non interest income impairment writedown impairment writedown income tax benefit adjusted non interest income adjusted net income basic earnings per share return on average assets impairment writedown impairment writedown adjusted basic earnings per share adjusted return on average assets diluted earnings per share return on average equity impairment writedown impairment writedown adjusted diluted earnings per share adjusted return on average equity liquidity  regulatory capital and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed and other securities  proceeds from sales of securities and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from sales of loans 
deposit flows and mortgage prepayments  however  are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
at december   the bank had an approved overnight line of credit of million with the fhlb ny 
in total  as of december   the bank may borrow up to million from the fhlb ny in federal home loan advances and overnight lines of credit 
as of december   the bank had borrowed million in fhlb ny advances

in addition  the trust has million in capital securities which are included in borrowed funds and the bank had million in repurchase agreements to fund lending and investment opportunities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
management believes their available sources of funds are sufficient to fund current operations 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  overnight interest earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of days or less 
the level of these assets is dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million from december  the company also held marketable securities available for sale with a carrying value of million at december  at december   the company had commitments to extend credit principally real estate mortgage loans of million and open lines of credit for borrowers principally construction loan and home equity loan lines of credit of million 
since generally all of the loan commitments are expected to be drawn upon  the total loan commitments approximate future cash requirements  whereas the amounts of lines of credit may not be indicative of the company s future cash requirements 
the loan commitments generally expire in ninety days  while construction loan lines of credit mature within eighteen months and home equity loan lines of credit mature within ten years 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the company s total interest and operating expenses in were million and million  respectively 
certificates of deposit accounts which are scheduled to mature in one year or less as of december  totaled million 
the market value of the assets of the company s defined benefit pension plan is million at december   which is million less than the benefit obligation 
during  the bank contributed million to the pension plan 
the underfunding is primarily due to a decline in the market value of pension plan s investments in and this underfunding has also been increased due to the reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation from a rate of in to in this reduction in the discount rate has resulted in an increase in the present value of the projected benefit obligation 
the company does not anticipate a change in the market value of these assets which would have a significant effect on liquidity  capital resources  or results of operations 
during  funds provided by the company s operating activities amounted to million 
these funds  together with million provided by financing activities and million available at the beginning of the year  were utilized to fund net investing activities of million 
financing activities were primarily provided by a growth in due to depositors of million and million borrowed during june to fund a hedging strategy 
principal payments and calls on loans and securities provided additional funds 
the primary investment activity of the company is the origination of loans  and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
during  the bank had loan originations and purchases of million 
further  during  the company purchased million of mortgage backed and other securities 
at the time of the bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank  the bank was required by the ots to establish a liquidation account which is reduced as and to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their qualifying deposits 
the balance of the liquidation account at december  was million 
in the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the bank  each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account 
the bank is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend or to repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect would be to cause the bank s regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account 
unlike the bank  the holding company is not subject to ots regulatory restrictions on the declaration or payment of dividends to its stockholders  although the source of such dividends could depend upon dividend payments from the bank 
the holding company is subject  however  to the requirements of delaware law  which generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the excess of its net assets the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities over its stated capital or  if there is no such excess  to its net profits for the current and or immediately preceding fiscal year 
regulatory capital position 
under ots capital regulations  the bank is required to comply with each of three separate capital adequacy standards tangible capital  leverage and core capital and total risk based capital 
such classifications are used by the ots and other bank regulatory agencies to determine matters ranging from each institution s semi annual fdic deposit insurance premium assessments  to approvals of applications authorizing institutions to grow their asset size or otherwise expand business activities 
at december  and  the bank exceeded each of the three ots capital requirements

critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition 
these policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
several of these policies require management s judgment to determine the value of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies 
the accounting policy that requires significant management valuation judgment is determining the allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses is provided to absorb estimated losses on existing loans that may be uncollectable 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing all impaired loans on an individual basis 
the remaining portfolio is evaluated based on the company s historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience 
a full credit cycle must be used  or loss estimates may be inaccurate 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available 
notwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the allowance for loan losses  the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands borrowed funds deposits loan commitments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension and other postretirement benefits deferred compensation plans total the company has significant obligations that arise in the normal course of business 
the company finances its assets with deposits and borrowed funds 
the company also uses borrowed funds to manage its interest rate risk 
the company has the means to refinance these borrowings as they mature through its financing arrangements with the fhlb ny and its ability to arrange repurchase agreements with broker dealers and the fhlb ny

the amounts do not include an increase for possible future retirees or increases in health plan costs 
the amount shown in the more than years column represents the amount required to increase the total amount to the projected benefit obligation of the directors plan and the medical and life insurance benefit plans  and the total that will be due under the supplemental retirement plan for the president  since these are unfunded plans

these plans generally require the deferred balance receives credit for earnings at a rate earned by certain mutual funds 
the employees will not receive a distribution from these plans until their employment is terminated 
the amounts shown for less than five years represent the amounts the bank will contribute to these plans  and assumes no employee will terminate their employment in less than five years 
the amount shown in more than five years represents the current accrued liability for these plans 
this expense is provided in the consolidated statements of income  and the liability has been provided in the consolidated statements of financial condition
