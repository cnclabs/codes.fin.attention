item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of the operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
historical results and percentage relationships among accounts are not necessarily an indication of trends in operating results for any future period 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
overview we are engaged in the business of issuing title insurance policies and performing other title related services  such as escrow activities in connection with real estate transactions 
we operate through over offices located in arizona  california and nevada and employ over  individuals 
our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our key performance indicators revenue  net income and non financial performance indicators opened orders  closed orders  average revenue per closed order  as well as the trends and uncertainties affecting our industry and markets and analyzes our liquidity and capital resources 
we reported net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant increase in earnings was due to the inclusion of operating results from nations holding group for the full year  as these operations were acquired in september also contributing to the increase in earnings was a strong housing market and high level of refinance transactions  particularly during the first three quarters of  resulting from low mortgage interest rates 
our revenue from title insurance  escrow and related real estate services is primarily from three sources residential resale  lender refinance and commercial real estate transactions 
we recognize revenue for the services we perform when the corresponding real estate transaction closes 
typically  we receive payment for our services at the time the related real estate transaction closes 
in some cases  we bill for services provided  principally related to our lender business  and collect the account receivable at a later date 
during fiscal  we anticipate that refinance transactions will decline to pre historical levels  which we expect will result in a decrease in our revenues and profits from existing operations 
opened orders began declining from  during the third quarter to  during the fourth quarter the decline in opened orders stabilized late in the fourth quarter and through february   we experienced an increase of over opened orders per day compared to december levels 
while this increase appears favorable  we believe maintaining operational flexibility in will be imperative 
the cyclical nature of the title insurance industry requires us to manage operating expense levels in response to market fluctuations 
while we believe the decrease in opened orders in the fourth quarter was primarily related to seasonality in the demand for title insurance and related services  we anticipate overall opened orders in to be lower than in for our existing operations 
application of critical accounting policies we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments  which form the basis for our critical accounting policies 
our most critical accounting policies relate to reserves for title insurance and escrow losses  related contingencies and litigation surrounding title and escrow losses and impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets 
reserves for title insurance and escrow losses when evaluating title insurance and escrow losses we estimate reserves for known claims as well as a provision for incurred but not reported losses based on several factors including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  and the current industry and legal environments 
settlement of claims for known  as well as incurred but not reported losses  for amounts greater than what has been provided for in these financial statements would require additional provision in future periods 
contingencies and litigation contingencies and litigation are reviewed by us on an ongoing basis and  in conjunction with legal counsel  determinations are made as to the outcome of any lawsuits and advice of claims 
based on this assessment  any required reserves are reflected in our financial statements 
to the extent a litigation claim or other contingency is settled for an amount greater than or less than what was anticipated  the difference would be reflected in a future period 
impairment of intangible assets we perform a test of each reporting unit for which goodwill is attributed to evaluate for any impairment of intangible assets at least annually 
this includes  among other things  a review of events or circumstances which would indicate an impairment of goodwill 
future losses from reporting units to which goodwill is attributed may lead to an impairment charge in future periods 
we believe estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
transactions affecting comparability of results of operations in january  we acquired land title of nevada  inc the acquisition marked our entrance into the las vegas  nevada market  adding five branch offices and employees 
the transaction included payment of million in cash and issuance of a million  five year note to the seller for a total purchase price of approximately million 
included in the results of operations during was revenue of approximately million and pre tax income of million related to the acquisition of land title of nevada  inc in september  we acquired nations holding group  including its wholly owned subsidiaries united title company  first california title company and united title insurance company 
the acquisition significantly increased our presence in california and enabled us to internally underwrite approximately of all title insurance policies that we issued in this acquisition has significantly improved the profitability of our existing operations because we no longer have to share all title insurance premiums with third party underwriters on transactions for which we issue and underwrite title insurance policies 
the purchase price  including direct transaction costs  was approximately million  which consisted of million in cash and million in redeemable preferred stock 
as part of the purchase we also issued warrants  valued at  to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the redeemable preferred stock includes an cumulative dividend  payable quarterly  and is redeemable after september at a redemption value of million 
a seven year term loan provided million to assist in the financing of the cash portion of the purchase price 
the term loan bears interest at the prime rate or libor plus 
we funded the remaining cash portion of the purchase price from our working capital 
in april  we increased our presence in northern california with the acquisition of five branch offices that perform title and escrow services 
the acquisition also included ownership interest in joint title plants and had a total cash purchase price of million 
included in the results of operations during was revenue of approximately million and pre tax income of million related to the acquisition of the five branch offices in northern california and nations holding group

we experienced a slight decline in the average revenue per closed order during compared to the prior year reflecting the increase in business mix toward refinance transactions  which typically carry lower revenue in comparison to residential resale and commercial real estate transactions 
as a result of anticipated changes in the interest rate environment in  and the impact that it will have on the demand for our services  we expect a decline in opened orders in compared to  resulting in a decrease in title and escrow related revenue from existing operations 
the significant components of other income include interest income from invested cash balances and fixed maturity bonds  investment dividends and revenue from servicing seller financed mortgages 
other income decreased as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  to from compared to the prior year

the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of united title insurance company  a title insurance underwriter  in operating results as a result of the nations holding group acquisition 
prior to this acquisition  our provision related solely to escrow losses  and title losses that were generally limited to a  deductible per claim 
however  for policies underwritten by united title insurance company  we are typically responsible for up to  per claim 
these factors also contribute to the million increase in the reserve for title insurance and escrow losses on our balance sheet at december  compared to december  the significant components of other operating expenses include title plant maintenance and access  supplies  utilities  insurance  allowance for bad debt  depreciation  delivery and professional fees 
other operating expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year

as a result  for the year ended december   approximately of this expense category is relatively variable in relation to revenue 
other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue in this expense category is a result of expenses which are relatively fixed  such as telecommunication costs  insurance  depreciation and utilities

the increase in open orders in compared to the prior year reflects the favorable residential mortgage refinance and resale environment experienced during as well as the result of including nations holding group s order counts for the final four months of we experienced an increase in the average fee per closed order during when compared to the prior year due to increases in property values in our markets and  to a lesser extent  due to increases in fees charged for title and escrow services

liquidity and capital resources we require capital above our ongoing operating needs to expand our geographical base  further implement our market penetration program  recruit and train new personnel and purchase additional property and equipment to implement our expansion program 
during the year ended december   we financed our operating and business development activities through operating cash flows and through the use of cash on hand 
in january  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire nationwide appraisal services corporation 
terms of the acquisition call for payment of up to million in cash at closing  with deferred payments of up to million dependent upon specified conditions

at december   we had approximately million accrued for incentive bonuses that we intend to pay during first quarter the following table sets forth our contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of december  contractual commitments and commercial obligations payments due by period contractual obligations less than one year thereafter in thousands debt maturities minimum lease commitments total in addition  we have preferred stock  which is non convertible and redeemable after for million 
the redeemable preferred stock has an cumulative dividend  payable quarterly 
our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share to stockholders of record as of january   and we paid this dividend totaling million on january  on february   we announced another quarterly cash dividend in the amount of 
per common share to be paid on april  to stockholders of record at the close of business on march  we have two million revolving lines of credit 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at the prime rate at december  
at december   there were no borrowings under either of these credit facilities

cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million during the prior year 
the increase in cash provided is the result of an improvement in earnings in compared to the significant non operating uses of cash for the year ended december  compared to the prior year included investment activities  most notably the net purchase of million of securities for the investment portfolio of united title insurance company 
additionally  as part of financing activities  we repaid million of debt during the year ended december   million of which was paid in advance of the required repayment schedule 
our title insurance underwriter  united title insurance company  is subject to regulations that limit its ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to its parent  principally for the protection of policy holders 
generally  the total amount of dividends and distributions is limited to the greater of of united title insurance company s surplus  which amount was million as of december   or of net income for the year period ended december   provided that the amount does not exceed united title insurance company s earned surplus 
under these restrictions  united title insurance company could pay  to its parent  dividends of million during without prior regulatory approval 
in order to strengthen united title insurance company s balance sheet and to attain higher ratings from third party rating agencies  no dividends have been paid by united title insurance company

of our million investment portfolio  consisting of short term investments  fixed maturity bonds and equity securities  relates to united title insurance and would be subject to the aforementioned restrictions 
we believe that cash on hand  anticipated future cash receipts and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating plans and to pay all obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that such sources  together with the debt commitment letter  will be sufficient to meet our expansion plans for the foreseeable future 
seasonality and quarterly results historically  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter  when fewer families move  buy or sell homes  with increased volumes in the spring and summer 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the year  subject to interest rate stability 
demand for our title insurance and related services generally tracks these seasonal demand patterns of the residential real estate market  although acquisitions of other title insurance companies and changes in interest rates may alter these traditional seasonal demand patterns 
we typically report our lowest revenue and earnings in the first quarter  with revenue and earnings increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter and declining again in the fourth quarter 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly operating data for each of the eight quarters ended december  such data have been prepared substantially on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report on form k  and include all adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
however  our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
future fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors  including interest rates and general real estate economic conditions  seasonality  the timing of acquisitions  and our ability to control costs in response to declining order volume 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results may be neither meaningful nor predictive of our future performance 
the quarterly data should be read together with the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
three months ended march  june  september  december  in thousands except per share data total revenue net income earnings attributable to common shares net income per common share other data opened orders closed orders average revenue per closed order three months ended march  june  september  december  in thousands except per share data total revenue net income earnings attributable to common shares net income per common share other data opened orders closed orders average revenue per closed order net income in fourth quarter was lower than fourth quarter primarily due to the decrease in revenue  while overall expenses were comparable in the respective periods 
we experienced a decline in demand in fourth quarter  however opted not to institute broad based cost saving measures as we anticipated an increase in demand for our services after the holiday season 
the decline in opened orders stabilized late in the fourth quarter and through february   we experienced an increase of over opened orders per day compared to december levels 
while this increase appears favorable  maintaining operational expense control in will be imperative 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our business is cyclical due to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the level of real estate activity 
periods of high interest rates adversely effect real estate activity and therefore title and escrow revenues 
in addition  the amount of interest income derived from available cash is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
our investment portfolio and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
an increase or decrease in prevailing interest rates typically translate into a decrease or increase in fair values of interest sensitive financial instruments 
at december   the carrying amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturity bonds and equity securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt approximate fair value 
fair values of fixed maturity bonds may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the security and other general market conditions 
our investments in equity securities are based on quoted market prices by third party sources 
market prices are subject to variability and as a result  the amount we may realize from a sale of an equity security investment may ultimately be significantly different than the reported market values 
variability in market prices may occur as a result of changes in economic conditions  relative price of similar  alternative investment choices and the market s perceived change in the value of the security itself 
our long term debt is comprised of three term loans  two of which provide for variable interest rates 
had interest rates increased or decreased basis points  interest expense on outstanding debt would have increased or decreased approximately  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively
