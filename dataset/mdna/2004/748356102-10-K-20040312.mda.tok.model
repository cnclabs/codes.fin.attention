item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
market resources  general questar s market resources group is the primary growth driver within questar 
as shown in the organization chart  market resources conducts its operations through several subsidiaries 
questar e p acquires and develops gas and oil properties 
wexpro develops cost of service reserves for questar gas 
gas management provides gas gathering and processing services for affiliates and third parties 
energy trading markets equity and third party gas and oil  provides risk management services  and owns and operates an underground gas storage reservoir 
questar e p conducts a blended program of lower risk development drilling and low risk reserve acquisitions 
it plans to take some exploration risks in by drilling one or more wells to evaluate deeper potential on its existing acreage at pinedale western wyoming and the uinta basin eastern utah 
it maintains a geographical balance and diversity with core activities in the rocky mountain region of wyoming  utah and colorado and the midcontinent region of oklahoma  texas and louisiana 
natural gas remains the primary focus of the market resources exploration and production e p operations 
as of year end  market resources had proved nonregulated reserves excluding cost of service reserves of bcf of gas and mmbbls of oil and ngls 
on an energy equivalent ratio  natural gas comprised approximately percent of proved nonregulated reserves again  excluding cost of service reserves 
e p growth strategy during the last three years  questar e p has focused on drilling wells and expanding production volumes from the pinedale anticline area in western wyoming 
on a combined basis  questar e p and wexpro have an approximate percent average working interest in  acres in the mesa area 
for  net nonregulated production from questar e p s wells at pinedale was bcfe compared to bcfe a year earlier 
during  questar e p continued its gas directed wasatch formation development drilling program in the uinta basin 
questar e p participated in gross wells in this region in  and had net production of bcfe 
to date  market resources has drilled three pinedale wells on acre spacing to evaluate optimum well density 
the three new wells were direct acre offsets to the mesa unit well drilled by a market resources affiliate in  the well was completed in only four lance formation intervals 
the well has produced approximately bcfe  primarily from a single interval 
market resources measured the reservoir pressure in the same interval for the three acre pilot wells 
the data indicates little depletion as a result of the original well 
during  market resources plans to drill additional acre pilot wells before seeking approval for field wide acre development 
except for reserves from the three currently producing acre pilot wells  market resources has not booked any proved reserves on acre locations at pinedale 
at year end  questar e p had over operated wasatch well locations yet to drill 
however  it expects lower production from the uinta basin in questar e p has now drilled over wells in the uinta basin since acquiring shenandoah energy inc sei in mid well performance on average has been below what was predicted at the time of the acquisition 
the current average expected ultimate recoverable eur reserves for all wasatch wells drilled to date is approximately bcfe  compared to predicted eur of to bcfe at the time of the sei acquisition 
questar e p attributes disappointing well performance to several factors  including high variability of the extent  quality and thickness of individual reservoirs and gathering system constraints 
in  questar e p drilled or participated in six wells around the periphery of its acreage to evaluate the potential of deeper mesaverde  blackhawk  and mancos formation targets at depths ranging from  to  feet 
results to date confirm the presence of gas in the deeper horizons  but initial production rates and projected eur from the deeper targets have been marginally economic 
questar e p may drill several additional wells in to continue evaluation of deep potential on its extensive uinta basin leasehold 
also in  questar e p identified multiple oil pools and an updip gas play in the shallow green river formation 
it continues to believe there is untapped potential in its extensive uinta basin leasehold acreage  but the extent and timing of exploitation remains uncertain 
questar e p has begun a systematic review of legacy properties in the greater green river basin in southwestern wyoming and northwestern colorado  where it has  gross leasehold acres  net acres 
it is evaluating deep potential  downspacing potential  and other play concepts on the flanks of older fields and will likely drill wells to evaluate some of these new opportunities in questar e p has successfully exploited gas and oil properties in the midcontinent that were obtained through acquisitions between and total midcontinent production was bcfe in  compared to bcfe in during  questar e p initiated a hartshorne coalbed methane cbm development project in the arkoma basin of eastern oklahoma 
it holds an average percent working interest in over  leasehold acres 
the hartshorne coal has been recognized as a potential cbm play for decades 
however  the thin to foot thick coal seam at  feet was only marginally economic when developed using conventional drilling and completion methods 
questar e p is using new directional drilling technology to drill horizontal laterals of  to  feet while remaining within the thin coal interval 
this approach greatly improves individual well recoveries and the overall economics of the play 
average well costs to date have been less than  with average expected reserves of to bcfe and average initial production of above mcfe per day 
based on acre spacing  questar e p has a working interest in about locations on its operated leasehold and will continue development in e p  risk management questar e p manages risk by focusing primarily on development drilling 
in addition  market resources will at times hedge up to percent of its forecasted production from proved developed reserves when commodity prices are attractive 
questar e p hedges production to lock in acceptable returns to protect cash flows and earnings from a decline in commodity prices 
market resources also manages market access risk by building the necessary infrastructure  particularly gathering and processing facilities  to handle production volumes 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  for more information concerning the e p group s risk management activities 
natural gas prices are volatile and subject to seasonal variations 
historically  the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months 
in addition to seasonal variations and commodity prices  weather both in terms of temperatures and moisture can have dramatic impacts on natural gas prices and on questar e p s operations 
transportation capacity significantly impacts gas prices 
the rocky mountain region is the fastest growing  major producing region in the united states 
the region produces more gas volumes than it can use  particularly during the non heating season of each year 
only about percent of the gas produced in the rockies is consumed by local markets 
since most production volumes must be transported outside the area  the availability of pipeline capacity is critical 
the expansion of the kern river pipeline in may of  which added an additional 
bcf of daily capacity from the rocky mountain area  helped sustain price levels during the summer of this new expansion  however  is fully subscribed  making it possible that prices will again be depressed during the summer of as production volumes from wyoming continue to increase 
e p  competition and customers questar e p faces competition in all aspects of its business  including the acquisition of reserves and leases  obtaining goods  services and labor  and marketing its production 
its growth strategy depends  in part  on its ability to purchase reasonably priced reserves and develop such reserves in a low cost and efficient manner 
during  questar e p decreased its lease operating expenses as a result of selling high operating cost properties in and increasing pinedale production volumes 
questar e p  through energy trading  sells natural gas production to a variety of customers including pipelines  gas marketing firms  industrial users and local distribution companies 
it regularly evaluates counterparty credit and may require financial guarantees from parties that fail to meet its credit criteria 
crude volumes are sold to refiners  remarketers and other companies  including some with pipeline facilities near the producing properties 
in the event pipeline facilities are not available  crude oil is trucked to storage  refining or pipeline facilities 
e p  regulation questar e p s operations are subject to various levels of government controls and regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling and production of wells  maintaining bonding requirements to drill and operate wells  submitting and implementing spill prevention plans  filing notices relating to the presence  use  and release of specified contaminants incidental to gas and oil production  and regulating the location of wells 
the operations are also subject to various conservation matters  including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units  the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of gas and oil properties 
most of questar e p s leases in the rocky mountain area are granted by the federal government and administered by federal agencies 
development of pinedale leasehold acreage is subject to the terms of winter drilling restrictions 
during the last two years  questar e p has been working with federal and state officials in wyoming to obtain authorization for limited winter drilling activities and has developed innovative measures  such as drilling multiple wells from a single location  to minimize the impact of its activities on wildlife and the habitat 
wexpro  general wexpro provides market resources with steady growth and predictable earnings through a business model that is unique in the energy industry 
wexpro conducts gas and oil development and production activities on certain producing properties for questar gas under the terms of a comprehensive settlement agreement that allows it to recover its costs plus a return on its investment 
the terms of the settlement agreement are described in note in item of this report 
the gas volumes produced by wexpro for questar gas are reflected in the latter s rates at cost of service prices 
wexpro s production and reserves statistics are not included in such statistics for any nonregulated activities 
cost of service gas  plus the gas attributable to royalty interest owners  satisfied percent of questar gas s system requirements during the average wellhead cost net of revenue credits of questar gas s cost of service gas in was per dth  which was lower than questar gas s average cost for field purchased gas 
wexpro  other wexpro s gas and oil development and production activities are subject to the same type of regulation as questar e p 
it  however  is also subject to scrutiny by the utah division of public utilities and the monitors hired by the division to review the prudence of its actions and its costs when operating assets for questar gas 
wexpro  under the terms of the settlement agreement  also owns oil producing properties 
the revenues from the sale of crude oil produced from such properties are used to recover operating expenses and to provide wexpro with a return on its investment 
any net income remaining after recovery of expenses and wexpro s return on investment is divided between wexpro percent and questar gas percent 
gathering  processing and marketing  general gas management performs gas gathering and processing activities 
under a contract with questar gas  gas management gathers cost of service volumes produced from properties operated by wexpro 
gas management has expanded its scope of gathering and processing activities to serve questar e p and other producers 
it is a percent partner in rendezvous gas services rendezvous  a joint venture that operates gas gathering facilities in western wyoming 
these facilities gather volumes from the pinedale anticline and jonah fields in western wyoming for delivery to various interstate pipelines that serve the region 
gas management plans to build a new gathering line from its blacks fork plant to a connection with the kern river pipeline 
gas management s processing margins are subject to the price difference between natural gas and ngls 
gas management is restructuring some of its processing agreements with producers from keep whole contracts to fee based contracts 
a keep whole contract insulates producers from ngl and gas price risk while a fee based contract eliminates commodity price risk for the plant owner 
energy trading conducts energy marketing activities 
it combines gas volumes purchased from third parties and equity production production from affiliates to build a flexible and reliable portfolio 
as a wholesale marketing entity  energy trading concentrates on markets in the pacific northwest  rocky mountains and midwest that are close to reserves owned by affiliates or accessible by major pipelines 
it contracts for firm transportation capacity on pipelines and firm storage capacity at clay basin a large baseload storage facility owned by questar pipeline 
energy trading uses derivatives as a risk management tool to provide price protection for physical transactions involving equity production and marketing transactions 
it executes hedges in the form of fixed price swaps for equity production on behalf of market resources with a variety of contracts of varying duration 
energy trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions 
see notes and included in item and item a of this report for additional information relating to hedging activities 
energy trading pays questar e p index prices for production volumes on which the latter entity calculates and pays royalties 
energy trading then resells such volumes and bears profit and loss risk 
in addition to contracting for storage capacity at clay basin  energy trading also owns a percent interest in and operates the clear creek storage facility in southwestern wyoming 
it uses owned and leased storage capacity together with firm transportation capacity to take advantage of price differentials and arbitrage opportunities 
regulated services questar s regulated services unit includes questar pipeline and questar gas 
questar pipeline transmission and storage  general questar pipeline is an interstate pipeline company that transports natural gas in the rocky mountain states of utah  wyoming and colorado and stores gas volumes in utah and wyoming 
as a natural gas company under the natural gas act of  questar pipeline is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as to rates and charges for storage and transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  construction of new facilities  extensions or abandonments of service and facilities 
questar pipeline s core transmission system is strategically located in the rocky mountain area near large reserves of natural gas 
it is referred to as a hub and spoke system  rather than a long line pipeline  because of its physical configuration  multiple connections to other major pipeline systems and access to six major producing areas 
in addition to this core system  questar pipeline  through a subsidiary  also owns and operates the southern trails pipeline  a mile line that extends from the rio blanco hub in the san juan basin to just past the california state line 
questar pipeline operates the clay basin storage facility  which is the largest underground storage reservoir in the rocky mountain region 
through a subsidiary  questar pipeline also owns gathering lines and a processing plant in price  utah that removes carbon dioxide from coalbed methane gas 
questar pipeline  customers  growth and competition questar pipeline s system was originally built to serve retail distribution markets in utah  and questar gas remains questar pipeline s largest single transportation customer 
during  questar pipeline transported mmdth for questar gas  compared to mmdth in questar gas has reserved firm transportation capacity of about mmdth per day on an ongoing basis or about percent of questar pipeline s reserved capacity  during the three coldest months of the year 
questar pipeline s primary transportation agreement with questar gas will not expire until june  given its strategic location and connections to other systems  questar pipeline also transported mmdth for nonaffiliated customers and delivered such volumes to pipelines owned by kern river pipeline  northwest pipeline  colorado interstate gas  transcolorado  wic and other systems 
questar pipeline s tariff provides a higher hydrocarbon dew point specification than other systems  which requires less processing by producers before natural gas volumes are delivered to questar pipeline s system 
kern river and northwest both require lower dew point gas  which means that questar pipeline must blend lower dew point processed gas with wet gas and in some instances isolate processed gas for delivery to such lines  which increases its operational costs 
during  questar pipeline increased its capacity for deliveries to kern river by mdth per day through the roberson creek interconnect in southwestern wyoming 
questar pipeline also completed its tie line expansion in late questar gas holds long term contracts for mdth per day on this new line  which is expandable to mdth per day with additional compression 
tie line provided critical incremental supplies and operating flexibility during a period of record demand in early rocky mountain producers and marketers want capacity on transmission systems that move gas to california kern river  the pacific northwest northwest pipeline or midwestern markets trailblazer pipeline  colorado interstate gas 
questar pipeline provides access for many producers to the systems 
some parties  including gas management  an affiliate of questar pipeline  are building gathering lines that allow producers to make direct connections to such pipeline systems 
questar pipeline continues efforts to build or acquire pipelines that transport gas out of the rocky mountains 
questar pipeline is unwilling to build significant new projects or expand its existing system without long term contracts for capacity 
questar pipeline has recently announced that it has sufficient market support for an expansion of its southern system in central utah 
this expansion  which is scheduled to be in service before the heating season  will add a daily mdth of capacity  which is fully supported by long term contracts 
in addition  questar pipeline is evaluating customer support for two additional projects 
a potential pipeline project would connect piceance gas supplies with the kanda hub in western wyoming 
questar pipeline is also assessing the feasibility of a gas storage project in western wyoming 
questar pipeline will continue to expand its system on an incremental basis to serve the needs of its customers 
the eastern segment of the southern trails line was placed into service in mid marketing constraints and california regulators continue to pose obstacles for questar pipeline s efforts to develop the western segment of southern trails from the california border to long beach  california 
questar pipeline continues to be involved in discussions with interested parties to sell or develop the western segment 
questar pipeline  regulation questar pipeline is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc as to rates and facilities 
within the last year  it filed necessary tariff provisions to comply with the ferc s segmentation rules and received regulatory permission to file revised tariff sheets to increase its fuel gas costs charged to shippers 
some shippers are protesting the increased fuel gas costs and are urging the ferc to suspend the tariff sheets pending a hearing or technical conference 
questar pipeline also recently filed a request for clarification of order no 
issued by the ferc in november of this order establishes standards of conduct for transmission providers when dealing with energy affiliates 
gas management and energy trading are energy affiliates of questar pipeline 
questar pipeline was actively involved in convincing the ferc to exempt local distr ibution companies such as questar gas from being labeled energy affiliates 
questar pipeline is also subject to the jurisdiction of the department of transportation dot with respect to safety requirements in the design  construction and operation of its transmission and storage facilities 
questar pipeline  in common with questar gas  is subject to the additional requirements of the pipeline safety improvement act of this act and rules issued by the dot require interstate pipelines and local distribution companies to implement a year program of risk analysis  pipeline assessment and remedial repair for transmission pipelines located in high consequence areas such as populated areas 
questar pipeline estimates that its annual cost to comply with the act will be about million 
after the initial year assessment  the pipelines in high consequence areas must be reassessed every seven years 
questar gas retail distribution  general questar gas distributes natural gas as a public utility in utah  southwestern wyoming and a small portion of southeastern idaho 
as of december   it was serving  sales and transportation customers  a percent increase from the  customers as of year end customers are defined in terms of active meters 
questar gas is the only non municipal gas distribution utility in utah  where over percent of its customers are located 
questar gas has the necessary regulatory approvals granted by the public service commissions of utah and wyoming pscu and pscw and the public utility commission of idaho to serve these areas 
it also has long term franchises granted by communities and counties within its service area 
questar gas  growth questar gas s growth is tied to the economic growth of utah and southwestern wyoming 
it has over percent of the load for residential space heating and water heating in utah 
questar gas  risk management questar gas faces the same risks as other local distribution companies 
these risks include revenue variations based on seasonal changes in demand  sufficient supplies  sufficient delivery points  and adequate distribution facilities 
questar gas s sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal  with a substantial portion of such sales made during the heating season 
the typical residential customer in utah defined as a customer using dth per year consumes over percent of his total gas requirements in the coldest six months of the year 
questar gas  however  has a weather normalization mechanism for its general service customers 
this mechanism adjusts the non gas portion of a customer s monthly bill as the actual degree days in the billing cycle are warmer or colder than normal 
this mechanism reduces the sometimes dramatic fluctuations i n any given customer s monthly bill from year to year and reduces fluctuations in questar gas s revenues 
questar gas minimizes its supply risks by owning natural gas producing properties 
during  it satisfied percent of its system requirements with the cost of service gas and associated royalty interest volumes produced from such properties 
wexpro produces the gas from these properties  which is then gathered by gas management and transported by questar pipeline 
questar gas had estimated proved cost of service natural gas reserves of bcf as of year end  compared to bcf a year earlier 
questar gas also has a balanced and diversified portfolio of gas supply contracts for volumes produced in the rocky mountain states of wyoming  colorado  and utah 
questar gas has regulatory approval to include costs associated with hedging activities in its balancing account for pass through treatment 
questar gas has designed its distribution system and annual gas supply plan to handle design day demand requirements 
it periodically updates its design day demand  which is the volume of gas that firm customers could use during extremely cold weather 
for the heating season  questar gas used a design day demand of  mdth for firm sales customers 
questar gas has long term contracts with questar pipeline for transportation capacity and storage capacity at clay basin and three peak day facilities 
it also contracts to take deliveries at several locations on the kern river pipeline that runs through utah 
in third quarter  questar gas expects to have its new customer information system fully operational 
the new system should increase questar gas s overall efficiency  provide better information to customers and allow it to reduce labor costs 
questar gas s greatest risk  however  is associated with regulation  which is discussed below questar gas  regulation as a public utility  questar gas is subject to the jurisdiction of the pscu and pscw 
natural gas sales and transportation services are made under rate schedules approved by the two regulatory commissions 
questar gas is authorized to earn a return on equity of percent in utah and percent in wyoming 
both the pscu and pscw permit questar gas to recover gas costs through a balancing account procedure and to reflect gas changes on a periodic  generally semi annual  basis 
questar gas has also received permission from the pscu and pcsw to reflect specified costs associated with hedging contracts in its gas costs 
at year end  the pscu issued an order in questar gas s general rate case approving a stipulation that reflected a test year primarily based on november  and changed its accounting for contributions in aid of construction 
on august   the supreme court of utah utah court issued an order reversing a decision made by the pscu in august of concerning certain processing costs incurred by questar gas 
specifically  the court ruled that the pscu in did not comply with its statutory responsibilities and regulatory procedures when approving a stipulation that permitted questar gas to reflect million in rates per year to recover certain processing costs 
the court s action forced questar gas to record a liability for the amounts collected in rates since june of the pscu subsequently determined to proceed with deliberations in the case that ended with the stipulation and to address the question whether questar gas met its burden of demonstrating that it acted prudently to incur processing costs in its rates in order to enhance the heating value of natural gas volumes delivered to customers 
before the pscu could set a schedule of additional hearing and briefs  the committee of consumer services a state agency that appealed the pscu s original decision approving the stipulation  filed a petition for extraordinary relief with the utah court 
questar gas  the pscu  and the division of public utilities another state agency have filed briefs opposing the committee s request 
the utah court has calendared march   to consider the committee s petition 
questar gas has significant relationships with affiliates that have allowed it to lower its costs and improve its efficiency 
these affiliate relationships  however  are subject to increased scrutiny by regulatory commissions for evidence of subsidization and above market payments 
at the current time  questar gas is reviewing the need to file a general rate case in utah in questar gas is also subject to the requirements imposed by the pipeline safety improvement act of  which is administered by the dot 
the act requires questar to develop an integrity management plan and assess the integrity of its high pressure lines in high consequence areas on a recurring basis 
questar gas estimates that it may be required to spend to million per year to comply with the new requirements 
questar gas  competition questar gas is a public utility and currently has no direct competition from other distributors of natural gas for residential and commercial customers 
it has historically enjoyed a favorable price comparison with other energy sources used by residential and commercial customers except coal and occasionally fuel oil 
it provides transportation service to industrial customers that can buy volumes of gas directly from others and have such volumes transported at aggregate prices lower than questar gas s sales rates 
questar gas makes very low margins on this transportation service  but could lose customers to kern river 
other questar s other operations include information technology and communication services questar infocomm  web hosting and data centers consonus  commercial real estate management interstate land  and well head gas analysis and automation  field compression and engine maintenance energy services 
questar is refocusing attention on primary business units and has no plans to enlarge the scope of these activities 
the company recently announced a reorganization of its information technology services to eliminate duplication and increase efficiency that will result in consolidation of base services within the parent and integrate other services in the business units 
consonus has never fulfilled its business purpose and has significantly retrenched its operations 
interstate land is selling its primary parcels of commercial real estate and will be merged with another questar entity

year end prices do not include the effect of hedging 
estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues are affected by natural gas and oil prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating natural gas and oil reserves and their estimated values  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in this document are estimates 
reference should be made to note included in item of this report for additional information pertaining to the questar s proved reserves as of the end of each of the last three years 
market resources will file estimated reserves as of december   with the energy information administration in the department of energy on form eia although market resources uses the same technical and economic assumptions when it prepares the eia  it is obligated to report reserves for all wells it operates  not for all wells in which it has an interest  and to include the reserves attributable to other owners in such wells

questar pipeline s transmission system includes  miles of transmission lines that interconnect with other pipelines 
its core system includes two segments  often referred to as the northern system and southern system 
the northern system extends from northwestern colorado through southwestern wyoming into northern utah  while the southern system extends from western colorado to elberta  utah 
the transmission mileage figure includes lines at storage fields and tap lines used to serve questar gas  the miles of the southern trails system in service that is owned by a subsidiary and the miles of overthrust pipeline owned by subsidiaries

involves claims filed by grynberg under the federal false claims act and is substantially similar to other cases filed against pipelines and their affiliates that have all been consolidated for discovery and pre trial motions in wyoming s federal district court 
the cases involve allegations of industry wide mismeasurement of natural gas quantities on which royalty payments are due the federal government 
the questar defendants have been deposing grynberg and currently plan to file a motion contending that the court has no jurisdiction over the case because grynberg cannot satisfy the statutory requirements fo r jurisdiction

during the winter of  market resources produced six pinedale wells to the deeper mesaverde formation to assess its potential 
based on the wells encouraging production performance  all pinedale wells were drilled to the mesaverde 
the success of the wells drilled in demonstrate the widespread productive potential of the mesaverde 
also during  market resources demonstrated that pad drilling is a technically and commercially feasible option for full development of the pinedale anticline 
by directionally drilling up to development wells from each surface location  market resources can develop this world class gas accumulation while minimizing the surface disturbance and environmental impact on critical mule deer winter rangeland 
with year round drilling  market resources projects that it could drill all remaining wells on its pinedale acreage with only nine new drilling pads 
the company is working with various stakeholders on a five year study to assess the impact of winter drilling on wildlife 
production from market resources uinta basin properties grew to bcfe in production data indicates well performance in some areas is falling significantly below projections made at the time the company acquired shenandoah energy sei 
current average reserves for all wasatch formation wells completed to date is approximately bcfe per well compared to predicted reserves of to bcfe at the time of the acquisition 
factors causing reduced well performance include high variability of the size  quality and thickness of individual reservoirs and difficulties in optimizing the gathering system to handle the highly variable flowing wellhead pressures that exist between different age wells 
market resources continues to adjust its reserve base to reflect performance related revisions 
higher realized sales prices in resulted in higher production taxes

the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions  exploration  development and production activities 
under this method  the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties  successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the costs of carrying unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed 
costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred 
the costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties 
individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment 
net capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned 
capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves 
the calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement  surface restoration and property abandonment costs  net of estimated equipment salvage values 
other property and equipment is generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants 
a gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned  or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected 
the company engages independent consultants to prepare estimates of the nonregulated proved gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis 
if the undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset group  the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value which is determined using discounted future net revenues

the agreement was effective august   and sets forth the rights of questar gas s utility operations to share in the results of wexpro s oil development operations and the rate of return that wexpro will earn for managing questar gas s reserves 
the agreement was approved by the pscu and pscw in and affirmed by the utah supreme court in see item  note 
accounting for derivatives the company uses derivative instruments  typically fixed price swaps  to hedge against a decline in the average selling prices of its gas and oil production 
accounting rules for derivatives require that these instruments be marked to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date 
the difference between fair value and carrying value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives 
the company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas as amended 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
when a derivative is terminated before its contract expires  the associated gain or loss is recognized as income over the life of the previously hedged production 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered 
the company s exploration and production operations use the sales method of accounting for gas  oil and ngl revenues  whereby revenue is recognized on all gas  oil and ngl sold to purchasers 
a liability is recorded to the extent that the company has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property 
revenues and prices for gas  oil  and ngl are reported on a net to the well basis after adjustments for regional basis  gathering and processing fees  and quality 
rate regulation regulatory agencies establish rates for the storage  transportation  distribution and sale of natural gas 
the regulatory agencies also regulate  among other things  the extension and enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional natural gas facilities 
regulation is intended to permit the recovery  through rates  of the cost of service  including a return on investment 
questar gas and questar pipeline follow sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  that requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities by companies subject to cost based regulation 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  pscu and pscw have accepted the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities 
recording of unbilled revenues questar gas records revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
the company estimates revenues for the period from the date the bills are sent to customers to the end of the month 
the estimates are reconciled on an annual basis in the summer when customers gas bills are at their lowest amount 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
weather normalization questar gas s tariff provides for monthly adjustments to customer charges to approximate the impact of normal temperatures on nongas revenues 
questar gas estimates the weather normalization adjustment for the unbilled revenue each month 
the weather normalization adjustment is evaluated each month and reconciled on an annual basis in the summer to agree with the amount billed to customers 
this accounting treatment has been accepted by the pscu and pscw 
group depreciation both questar gas and questar pipeline use group depreciation for the majority of their fixed assets 
under this policy  assets are depreciated in groups of similar assets rather than on an individual asset basis 
when an asset is retired  the original cost and a like amount of accumulated depreciation are removed from the books 
the method typically increases depreciation expense over what would be recognized under the individual asset method  and eliminates gains and losses when a group depreciated asset is retired 
assets that can be separately identified  such as buildings  vehicles and computers  are depreciated on an individual asset basis 
the ferc  pscu and pscw have accepted the use of group depreciation 
employee benefit plans independent consultants hired by the company use actuarial models to calculate the yearly expenses of pension  postretirement benefits and benefit payments to recipients of a long term disability program 
the models consider mortality estimations  liability discount rates  return on investments  rate of increase of compensation  amortizing gain or loss from investments and medical cost trend rates among the key factors 
management makes assumptions based on parameters and advice from the consultants 
the company s general policy is to make contributions to the pension fund approximately equal to the yearly expense 
questar recorded an additional minimum pension liability of million  a million intangible pension asset and an after tax comprehensive loss of million as of december  related to its defined pension benefit plans 
in and  a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets  combined with a lower benefit liability discount rate  caused the calculated accumulated benefit obligation to exceed the fair value of the pension plan s assets 
the condition can be remedied by an increase in fair value of assets  an increase in the benefit liability discount rate and or through additional company contributions 
the company has no plans to materially increase the amount of its pension contributions in the near future 
improved returns on pension plan assets in reduced the additional minimum pension liability 
recent accounting developments the securities and exchange commission has requested that the financial accounting standards board review the applicability of certain provisions of sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk questar s primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas  oil and other hydrocarbons and volatility in interest rates 
a market resources subsidiary has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments 
commodity price risk management market resources bears the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses gas and oil price hedging arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements 
however  these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements 
the hedging contracts exist for a significant share of market resources owned gas and oil production and for a portion of gas and oil marketing transactions 
market resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives 
natural gas and oil price hedging support market resources earnings and cash flow targets and protect earnings from downward movements in commodity prices 
the volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by market resources board of directors 
the company intends to hedge up to of forecast production from proved developed reserves when prices are attractive 
proved developed production represents production from existing wells 
market resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves 
hedges are matched to equity gas and oil production  thus qualifying as cash flow h edges under the accounting provisions of sfas as amended and interpreted 
gas hedges are structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines  locking in basis and hedge effectiveness 
that portion of hedges no longer deemed effective is immediately recognized in the income statement 
the ineffective portion of hedges was not significant in  and as of december   approximately of forecast gas production is hedged at an average price of per mcf  net to the well 
hedges are more heavily weighted to the rockies to reduce basis risk and to protect returns on capital 
in addition  market resources could curtail production if prices drop below levels necessary for profitability 
market resources enters into commodity price hedging arrangements with several banks and energy trading firms 
generally  the contracts allow some amount of credit before market resources is required to deposit collateral for out of the money hedges 
in some contracts  the amount of credit allowed before market resources must post collateral varies depending on the credit rating assigned to market resources debt 
at market resources current credit ratings  the credit available from each counterparty ranges between million and million  depending on the agreement 
in cases where this arrangement exists  if market resources credit ratings fall below investment grade bbb by standard poor s or baa by moody s  counterparty credit generally falls to zero 
the company maintains lines of credit to cover potential collateral calls 
collateral required at december   wa s million 
a summary of market resources hedging positions for equity production as of february   is shown below 
prices are net to the well 
currently  all hedges are fixed price swaps with creditworthy counterparties  which allows the company to achieve a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point  ie  incorporating a known basis 
the swap price is then reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price

this investment consists of an allocation of the original price of the inch diameter line  relocation costs  and engineering costs 
questar has been actively pursuing various alternatives for the western segment including selling the pipeline and completing the conversion of the former liquids pipeline for natural gas service 
active discussions are being held with a party interested in acquiring the pipeline and completing the conversion to gas service 
questar intends to complete the sale of the pipeline during if not  questar will continue to pursue other alternatives  including conducting an open season to determine market support for putting the pipeline into natural gas service 
federal energy regulatory commission ferc order no 
on standards of conduct for transmission providers in november  the ferc issued final rules on nondiscriminatory standards when dealing with affiliated energy companies 
the initial notice of proposed rule making nopr would have included affiliated local distribution companies ldcs  such as questar gas  in the marketing affiliate regulations 
the final rule exempts ldcs from the regulations as long as they do not engage in off system sales 
as a policy  questar gas does not make off system sales 
questar does not believe that the final order will have a significant impact on its operating costs 
ferc rule on quarterly financial reporting the ferc issued a rule on quarterly financial reporting and revision to the annual reports 
the rule  among other issues  requires a new quarterly filing of financial statements 
the ferc has not previously required quarterly statements 
the added burden of preparing quarterly reports for the ferc is not expected to significantly increase operating costs
