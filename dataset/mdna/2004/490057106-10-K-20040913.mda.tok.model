overview revenues our revenues consist of three components net sales  research and development revenue and royalty income 
net sales 
net sales is comprised of sales of biomaterials products and the triactiv device 
biomaterials 
in the year of our ipo  fiscal  our biomaterials sales were comprised entirely of the absorbable collagen and polymer components of the angio seal supplied to our strategic alliance partner 
since that time  we have experienced significant sales growth in our biomaterials products as we have expanded our customer base and marketing activities  increased sales to existing customers and assisted in the development of new product offerings 
the biomaterials component of net sales  which comprises of total net sales  represents the sale of our biomaterials products to customers for use in the following markets orthopaedics sports medicine and spine  cardiology  drug biologics delivery  periodontal  general surgery and wound care 
the two most significant components of our biomaterials sales are our orthopaedic product sales and the absorbable components of the angio seal  supplied to st 
jude medical 
our orthopaedic product sales to date have consisted primarily of sales to arthrex  a privately held orthopaedics company for which we manufacture a wide array of sports medicine products 
during fiscal  we sold our first bone grafting and spine products to orthovita  a publicly held orthopaedic biomaterials company 
in the next fiscal year and beyond  we anticipate our sales of these products and new products to orthovita  to become a more significant portion of our total biomaterials sales 
below is a table showing the trends in our angio seal and orthopaedic sales fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of our total biomaterials sales percentage of total biomaterials sales product fiscal fiscal angio seal components orthopaedic products the decline in the angio seal components as a percentage of total biomaterials sales is related to the on going transition of the manufacture of the absorbable polymer anchor from us to st 
jude medical offset in part by increases in sales of the collagen component related to increased sales volume of the angio seal device 
based on discussions with st 
jude medical  we believe their current plans are that we will remain a supplier of approximately of the future anchor requirements for the angio seal 
we are to continue to supply a minimum of of the collagen component for the device under a three year contract with st 
jude medical  which currently expires in december the increase in our orthopaedic products sales as a percentage of total biomaterials sales is primarily related to the growth of sales to arthrex  which represented of total biomaterials sales for fiscal in addition  in our third fiscal quarter  we shipped our first commercial products to orthovita 
these sales represented approximately of our total biomaterials sales for fiscal we expect the growth in our overall biomaterials sales to continue because of greater acceptance by the medical community of biomaterials and technological advances which have expanded the applications for our biomaterials products 
biomaterials sales growth was in fiscal over fiscal due to this greater acceptance  we have been able to expand our biomaterials customer and product base by initiating new partnerships within the medical device industry  as well as expanding the product lines for our current customers 
triactiv system 
the triactiv device was commercially launched in europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal we are selling directly to the market in germany and through distributors throughout the rest of europe 
we currently have distribution agreements for sales in ireland  switzerland  austria  italy  netherlands and the united kingdom 
we have entered into two distribution agreements during fiscal  and are in the process of identifying additional distributors for markets in europe and asia 
the triactiv sales were less than of our total sales for fiscal we anticipate the triactiv system will become a more significant component of net sales during our fiscal year ending june  and beyond as we gain new customers in the european markets  introduce new versions and applications of the product and launch the product in the us market 
we currently anticipate commercial launch of the triactiv system in the us in the third quarter of fiscal  subject to us regulatory approval  via a direct sales force 
we received european community approval ce mark to market the second generation triactiv device  the triactiv r fx embolic protection system the triactiv fx  in november this second generation device incorporates several important ease of use design enhancements including an integrated  fully disposable flush and extraction system  a new balloon inflator that simplifies catheter exchanges during the procedure  and a monorail flush catheter to enhance device usage and reduce procedure time 
we expect to initiate european marketing of the triactiv fx in the second half of fiscal research and development revenue 
in fiscal  research and development revenue was derived from a national institute of standards and technology nist grant and a national institute of health nih grant 
in november  we received our first nist grant 
since that time we have been awarded a second nist grant and an nih grant 
under the first nist grant  a million grant over a three year period  we were researching cartilage regeneration utilizing our porous tissue matrix ptm technology 
although we continue to independently develop this technology  we received all remaining funds under this grant in our second quarter of fiscal in october we received the second nist grant  a million grant over a three year period  under which we are researching a synthetic vascular graft  also utilizing our ptm technology 
this project is expected to continue through october in january  we received from the nih   over a one year period  under which we were researching sustained or controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer utilizing our ptm technology 
research under this grant was completed in early fiscal  but we are continuing to independently develop this drug delivery technology for commercial use and expectations of future grant applications 
royalty income 
our royalty income consists of royalties received from st 
jude medical and orthovita 
royalties from st 
jude medical are received on every angio seal unit sold worldwide 
we anticipate sales of the angio seal will continue to grow as st 
jude medical continues to expand its sales and marketing efforts  including its recent launch of the angio seal product line in the japanese market  and releases future generations of the angio seal system  including its launch of the self tightening suture sts plus version of the device in the us and europe 
our royalty rate as of june  was 
the original rate of was contractually reduced from to  in accordance with our license agreements  during the fiscal quarter ended december  when a cumulative one million angio seal units had been sold 
there was one further contracted decrease in the royalty rate  to  upon reaching four million cumulative units sold 
this final rate reduction occurred in april we believe continued angio seal unit growth will partially offset this decline in royalty rate for a net reduction in royalty income in fiscal from fiscal of approximately 
we  therefore  expect that royalty income from the angio seal will continue to be a significant source of revenue 
as of june  approximately million angio seal units had been sold 
in march  we entered into an agreement with orthovita under which we will develop and commercialize products based on orthovita s proprietary  ultra porous vitoss tm bone void filler material in combination with our proprietary biomaterials 
the products will have applications in the bone grafting and spinal surgery markets 
under the agreement  the products will be co developed  we will manufacture the products and orthovita will market and sell the products worldwide 
orthovita launched the initial bone grafting and spinal product line  vitoss scaffold foam strips and cylinders  in the third quarter of fiscal and the second family of products  vitoss scaffold foam flow in june under the agreement  we receive a royalty on orthovita s end user sales of all co developed products 
we believe the unique technology associated with the vitoss foam products and the size and strength of the spine market will result in the orthovita component of royalty income becoming more significant over the next several quarters and beyond 
cost of products sold 
we have experienced an overall increase in gross margin during fiscal reflecting the continued increase in volume of biomaterials product sales 
this increased volume  from both our existing customers and new customers  has resulted in manufacturing efficiencies 
the volume increase also results in our fixed costs being spread over a greater number of units 
we anticipate the gross margin on our biomaterials products will continue to improve with continued increased sales volume 
we have experienced higher volume of our sales of biomaterials products and greater manufacturing efficiencies  which has lowered our unit costs in many of our product lines 
however  we also initiated three new product lines during fiscal  the orthovita vitoss foam strips  cylinder and flow products 
during the initial phases of production of these product lines we incurred higher costs due to the learning curve associated with initiating new products 
our expectations for the gross margin after maturity of this product line are expected to be in line with our overall gross margins for the company as a whole 
we anticipate the gross margin on our biomaterials products will continue to improve with expected increases in sales volume and efficiencies gained in new product lines 
these improvements could potentially be offset by low initial margins on the triactiv product line in our first year of us sales 
as a result of our expanding product mix  for fiscal  we believe our total gross margin  across all product lines  will be only slightly improved over fiscal research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary technologies  such as the triactiv system  absorbable and nonabsorbable biomaterials products and technologies and other development programs  including expenses under the nist and nih programs 
in december  we began our triactiv us pivotal clinical study  the pride study  a randomized trial at up to sites in the u 
s and europe 
we completed enrollment in the pride study during march we enrolled a total of patients in the pride study  including roll in patients  at sites in the us and sites in europe 
submission of data from the trial to the fda for k approval occurred in july if we are granted approval from the fda  we will market and sell the device in the us using a small direct sales team with an anticipated market launch in january we also completed a six patient pilot study  the tracer study  on the carotid artery application for the triactiv system in september this study was completed at one clinical site in costa rica 
the triactiv carotid application device was successfully used to provide protection from potential stroke causing emboli by actively removing debris during carotid stenting procedures 
we plan to begin enrollment in a ce mark study for the triactiv carotid application during fiscal we also plan to initiate a us registry on a next generation triactiv device  the triactiv lfx  in our third quarter of fiscal the study is a planned to patient study at sites in the us we cannot make any assurances as to the successful completion of these trials or subsequent regulatory approval for the triactiv system or for future applications in the us or in europe 
clinical efforts in pursuit of fda approval and continuing development of the triactiv system  as well as our continued development of proprietary biomaterials products and technologies  require significant research and development expenditures 
we anticipate research and development expense will continue to increase as we pursue commercialization of the triactiv system in the us  and explore opportunities for other indications related to the triactiv system as well as our other technologies  including the continued development of proprietary biomaterials technologies 
while we believe research and development expense will increase in dollars  we believe that it will decrease as a percentage of total revenue as our revenue continues to grow 
research and development expense was of total revenue in fiscal compared to of total revenue in fiscal we anticipate research and development will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal and beyond 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense includes general and administrative costs  including activities of our finance  human resource and business development departments  as well as costs related to the sales and marketing of our products 
the general and administrative component of selling  general and administrative expense increased over fiscal this increase was a result of the overall growth of our business as well as expenses incurred related to compliance with new sec and corporate governance regulations 
the sales and marketing component of selling  general and administrative expenses has also increased over fiscal this increase relates to increased sales efforts for the triactiv system in europe  which was commercially launched in may  and the move toward commercialization of the triactiv system in the us in january  we received ce mark approval from the european regulatory authority for the triactiv system  which allows commercial sale of the product in the european union 
we established a subsidiary in germany  kensey nash europe gmbh where we maintain a european sales and marketing team 
this team consisted of a vice president of european sales and marketing  three clinical specialists and four sales people as of june  we plan to continue to add personnel to this team when we believe it is required to meet our clinical and sales goals 
this team is selling the product direct in the german market and supports our distributor relationships in the rest of europe 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we await us regulatory approval of the triactiv system 
if approved by the fda  we will market and sell the triactiv system in the us through a small  dedicated direct sales force initially comprised of approximately ten salespeople 
our initial estimates of the cost of a direct sales plan would increase selling expense in fiscal by million to million  including personnel and marketing expenses  over fiscal we also continue to expand our marketing efforts for our biomaterials business 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate was approximately for fiscal year compared with for the year ended june  in the prior year our effective tax rate was reduced by a million tax credit related to historic qualified research and development activities of the company 
our fiscal effective income tax rate includes our current year research and development tax credit 
we are forecasting an effective tax rate for fiscal of approximately 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
accordingly  sales revenue is recognized when the related product is shipped 
all of our shipments are free on board fob shipping point 
revenue under research and development contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
royalty revenue is recognized as the related product is sold 
advance payments received for products or services are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation costs under accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
which permits i recognition of the fair value of stock based awards as an expense  or ii continued application of the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we account for our stock based employee and director compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb under this intrinsic value method  compensation cost represents the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the grant date over the amount the grantee must pay for the stock 
our policy is to grant stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant 
therefore  we have not recognized any compensation expense for options granted to employees 
we account for stock based awards to non employees using the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires using the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the option at the original grant date 
options granted to non employees  as defined under sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  are recorded as an expense over the service period 
we granted options to non employees  outside consultants  during fiscal and fiscal see note to the financial statements for information regarding options granted to non employees in july and october allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we maintain a bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  significant one time events and historical experience with each customer 
also  we record additional reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be adjusted 
we believe our allowance at june  is sufficient to cover all existing accounts receivable 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
adjustments to inventory are made at the individual part level for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired balances  to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality concerns 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if any of these factors differ from our estimates 
income taxes 
our estimated effective tax rate includes the impact of certain research and development tax credits 
material changes in  or differences from our estimates of  these three factors could impact our estimate of our effective tax rate 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and the following table summarizes our operating results for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended percent change june  of total june  of total from fy millions revenues millions revenues to fy total revenues net sales research development revenue royalty income cost of products sold research development expense selling  general administrative expense interest income net income total revenue and net sales 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in the fiscal net sales of products increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of our biomaterials products  specifically our orthopaedic products  which increased in fiscal over fiscal orthopaedic product sales increased as a result of increased sports medicine product sales to arthrex  our largest orthopaedic customer  and the initial sales of a new spine product line to orthovita under an agreement entered into in march sales to these two customers increased million  or  and million  which was entirely new business  respectively  over fiscal this increase was partially offset by a million  or decrease in angio seal component sales 
the decrease in angio seal component sales was related to the on going transition of the manufacture of the absorbable polymer anchor from us to st 
jude medical offset in part by increases in sales of the collagen component related to increased sales volume of the angio seal device 
based on discussions with st 
jude medical  we believe their current plans are for us to remain a supplier of approximately of the future anchor requirements for the angio seal 
we will continue to supply a minimum of of the collagen component for the device under a three year contract with st 
jude medical  which currently expires in december the triactiv sales represented less than of our total sales in fiscal and fiscal research and development revenue 
research and development revenues decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal fiscal revenues were generated under the nist synthetic vascular graft development grant and the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant 
in the prior fiscal year  revenues were generated under these same two grants in addition to the nist articular cartilage grant 
the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant provided revenue for four of the twelve months of fiscal  as the project concluded in october the nist vascular graft grant provided revenue for the entire year 
the decrease from the prior fiscal year reflects the conclusion of the nist articular cartilage grant in october  which provided  of revenue in fiscal and did not provide revenue in fiscal in addition  the decrease from the prior year reflected a decrease in reimbursements under the synthetic vascular graft grant  which generated  in revenue for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease was attributable to the timing of animal studies  which are a significant component of the total reimbursement under the grant 
specifically  an animal study concluded prior to the second quarter of fiscal and another animal study started in late third fiscal quarter of  in contrast to fiscal where an animal study was being conducted throughout the year 
the following table summarizes the research and development revenue for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  percentage change grant fiscal fiscal from fy to fy nist articular cartilage  nist vascular graft   nih breast cancer drug delivery   total r d revenue   royalty income 
royalty income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in royalty income was primarily due to the increase in angio seal royalties from st 
jude medical 
this increase occurred despite a decline  from to  in the contracted angio seal royalty rate in april our royalty rate as of june  was 
the original rate of was contractually reduced from to  in accordance with our license agreements  during the fiscal quarter ended december  when a cumulative one million angio seal units had been sold 
one final contracted decrease in the royalty rate  to  occurred upon reaching four million cumulative units sold in april the increase in royalty income despite this fourth quarter reduction in royalty rate reflected a greater number of units sold as well as an increase in the average selling price for the angio seal 
royalty units increased  as approximately million angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately  units sold during fiscal the average worldwide selling price increased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
we believe that the increase in units is due to st 
jude medical s continued sales and marketing efforts  which are resulting in greater market share and overall increased adoption of vascular closure devices in the market 
st 
jude medical s market share is estimated at in fiscal up from in fiscal and worldwide market penetration is estimated at over up from approximately in fiscal and  respectively 
st 
jude medical launched the most recent generation of the angio seal product line  the sts plus platform in september commanding a premium price over the previous version of the device 
in fiscal  royalty income also included a new royalty from orthovita under the march manufacturing  development and supply agreement between our two companies 
this royalty is received on all co developed vitoss products of end user sales of such products by orthovita 
the first royalty was earned in the third quarter of fiscal when orthovita commercially launched the first co developed products 
royalty income from orthovita was approximately  for the fiscal year cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross margin increased to from for the same periods 
the increase in gross margin reflected the higher margins on our biomaterials products attributable in part to higher volumes  which resulted in manufacturing efficiencies  as well as continued allocation of overhead across greater sales volumes  resulting in a decrease in per unit costs 
the higher margins were slightly offset by lower margins on the triactiv device and new biomaterials products  specifically orthovita 
the triactiv margins will continue to be lower than our biomaterials product margins until our manufacturing process matures and volumes increase 
also  we initiated a new product line during the third fiscal quarter  orthovita s vitoss foam products 
during the initial phases of production of this product line we incurred higher costs due to the learning curve associated with new products 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal while research and development expenses continued to increase in dollars  they decreased as a percentage of total revenue to from for fiscal periods ended june  and june   respectively 
expense increases were primarily due to our development efforts on our biomaterials products including our work under the nist grant 
biomaterials and other proprietary technologies spending increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal related primarily to increases in personnel costs totaling  and facility costs  including rent  electric and depreciation of  to support our continued development of new products and processes for our current and prospective customers 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as we investigate and develop new products  conduct clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for our proprietary products 
expense increases were also attributable to our continued development efforts on the triactiv  including clinical trial expenses 
research and development expenses related to the triactiv increased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal expense increases occurred in personnel costs  facility costs  including rent  electric and depreciation  and patent counsel fees and other consulting costs  all of which were to support the final efforts on our pride clinical study and the growth in the development efforts on the next generation of the triactiv  the triactiv lfx 
these cost increases were partially offset by a  decrease in fiscal from fiscal in various product design costs related to the triactiv svg application 
over the past year  there have been many new design features ease of use improvements for the triactiv product 
as of the third fiscal quarter  many of these design enhancements had been implemented and the expenses related to these improvements were not at the level they had been during the prior year 
in addition  there was a decrease in clinical trial costs  due to the conclusion of enrollment in the pride clinical study in march selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase related primarily to the triactiv european sales and marketing efforts  which increased  mainly due to a marketing clinical study in support of third party reimbursement of triactiv in europe 
the clinical study expenses increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this study is expected to conclude in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  increases occurred in the overall operations in europe to support our clinical and commercial efforts  including personnel costs  convention and travel expenses  as well as office and facility costs  including rent  phone  and electric 
these increases in the european sales and marketing expenses include an exchange rate premium from fiscal to the average exchange rate in fiscal was  whereas the average exchange rate in fiscal was 
of the increases above  approximately  of the  related to the increase in the exchange rate  or of each of the increases stated above is directly related to the difference in the exchange rate 
the us marketing expenses increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily for personnel expenses  and pre launch activities  such as marketing materials and publications  as we prepare for our commercial launch 
general and administrative expenses increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was attributable to increases of  in personnel costs   in facility costs  including rent  electric and depreciation and  in increased professional services and public company expenses  including investor relations and sec filing fees 
these personnel and facility cost increases were primarily related to the support of our continued sales and research and development growth  while increased professional fees as well as personnel costs were related to complying with the sarbanes oxley act of soa 
offsetting these increases was a decrease of  in audit and tax fees and a  decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
although the audit portion of our fees increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  our tax services fees in fiscal decreased by  related to a  professional service fee in fiscal for the research and development tax credit project performed 
there was a  professional service fee in fiscal when the final portion of the research and development tax credit project was performed 
related to the accounts receivable allowance  we were carrying a receivables reserve for an amount due from a company that had filed for bankruptcy 
the outstanding balance has since been paid and the reserve was no longer required 
net interest income 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was due to a lower principal balance on our debt balance as we continue to make our required quarterly payments 
interest income decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal although our cash and investment balances increased  this was more than offset by lower interest rates 
other non operating income expense 
other non operating income was  for fiscal compared to other non operating expense of for fiscal other non operating expense income for both periods represented primarily the net loss or gain on the sale of fixed assets

total revenues increased to million in the year ended june  from million in the year ended june  net sales of products increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal while triactiv sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  they represented less than of total sales for fiscal as such  the increase in total sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of the angio seal components and our orthopaedic products 
our orthopaedic products increased in fiscal over fiscal research and development revenue 
research and development revenues increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal fiscal revenues were generated under the nist articular cartilage and synthetic vascular graft development grants and the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant 
in the prior fiscal year  revenues were generated under the nist articular cartilage and synthetic vascular graft development grants 
the nist articular cartilage grant provided revenue for four of the twelve months of fiscal  as the project concluded in october the nist vascular graft grant provided revenue for the entire year 
the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant was initiated in september the increase over the prior fiscal year reflects the addition of the nih breast cancer grant  which provided  of revenue in fiscal and an increase in the activities and expenses related to the nist synthetic vascular graft grant 
the vascular graft grant revenue increased  in fiscal  from fiscal these increases were offset by a decrease of  in the nist articular cartilage grant due to the conclusion of the grant in early fiscal the following table summarizes the research and development revenue for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  percentage change from grant fiscal fiscal fy to fy nist articular cartilage   nist vascular graft   nih breast cancer drug delivery  total r d revenue   royalty income 
royalty income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase reflects a greater number of units sold as well as an increase in average selling price for the angio seal 
the average worldwide selling price increased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
royalty units increased as approximately  angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately  units sold during fiscal we believe that this unit increase was primarily due to st 
jude medical s increased sales and marketing efforts  resulting in market share gains for the angio seal product line in both the us and european markets and the full year impact of the self tightening suture sts version of the angio seal  which was introduced in the us in march cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross margin increased to from 
the increase in gross margin reflected the higher margins on our biomaterials products attributable in part to higher volumes which result in manufacturing efficiencies  as well as continued allocation of overhead across greater sales volumes  which results in a decrease in per unit costs 
the higher margins on our biomaterials products were slightly offset by lower margins on the triactiv 
the triactiv margins will continue to be lower than our biomaterials product margins until our manufacturing process matures and volumes increase 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal research and development expenses related to the triactiv increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to our continued development efforts on the triactiv  including clinical trial expenses  which increased million in fiscal over fiscal other increases occurred in personnel expenses  and operational expenses related to new design features ease of use improvements for the triactiv product line 
we also continued to expand our development efforts on our biomaterials products including our work under the nist grants 
biomaterials and other proprietary technologies spending increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increases related primarily to personnel costs  operational expenses related to product development costs  facility costs  including rent  electric and depreciation  and patent counsel fees and other consulting costs

selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million  in fiscal this increase was partially the result of increased sales and marketing expenses which increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase related primarily to european sales and marketing efforts on the triactiv  which increased million in fiscal from fiscal our subsidiary in germany was established in january since that time we have established a european sales and marketing team to meet our clinical and sales goals 
fiscal year was the first full year of european sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to  in increased personnel costs and  in increased professional services and public company expenses  including investor relations and filing fees 
these increases were related to our continued sales and research and development growth  but primarily to increased costs related to complying with the sarbanes oxley act of soa 
in addition  selling  general and administrative include a  professional service fee  which relates directly to a research and development tax credit project performed in our fiscal fourth quarter see below 
net interest income 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was due to a lower principal balance on the thm acquisition obligation as we continue to make the required quarterly payments and as a result of early repayment to certain debt holders 
interest income decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal although our cash and investment balances increased  this was more than offset by lower interest rates 
other non operating income expense 
other non operating income was for fiscal compared to other non operating expense of  for fiscal other non operating expense income for both periods represented primarily the net loss or gain on the sale of fixed assets 
net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was primarily the result of increased sales and royalty income as described above  offset in part by increased expenses associated with research and development and sales and marketing efforts related to the triactiv  also described above 
in addition  the company recognized million in income tax expense in fiscal compared to million of income tax expense in fiscal the tax expense in fiscal was net of a million research and development tax credit described below 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and investments were million at june   an increase of million from our balance of at the end of our prior fiscal year  june  in addition  our working capital was million at june   an increase of million from our working capital of million at june  net cash provided by our operating activities was million and million in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
in the fiscal year ended june   we had net income of million  a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of million and non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
in addition  changes in asset and liability balances provided  of cash 
the increase in cash provided by the change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to the utilization of our deferred tax asset coupled with a reduction in prepaid and other assets and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses 
this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
the decrease in our prepaid and other assets was directly attributable to pre payments related to our clinical trial contracts 
these prepaid balances are expensed when the service is performed 
as we completed enrollment in our pride study  many of the related services have been performed and pre payments expensed 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was directly related to our accrued tax liability 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million federal tax liability to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal prior to the fourth quarter  including the entire fiscal year  the deferred tax asset was utilized as we were in a net operating loss nol position and therefore no federal tax liability was recorded during those time periods 
increases in accounts receivable related to the increased sales levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the same period in fiscal in the fiscal year ended june   changes in asset and liability balances resulted in a net  use of cash  net income was million  a tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million and non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  this was the net result of purchase and redemption activity within our investment portfolio 
we had million of investments mature or called during the fiscal year we subsequently purchased new investments with these proceeds as well as invested an additional million of our cash or cash equivalents  for total investment purchases of million 
see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a description of our available for sale securities 
see discussion below for cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
we had an million capital spending plan for fiscal  of which we spent million through june  on machinery  equipment  furniture and fixtures as well as leasehold improvements to fit out additional leased space and to reconfigure existing space 
these expenditures were primarily related to the expansion of our research and development capabilities  expansion and upgrade of our mis technology  and the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities for our biomaterials and triactiv product lines million 
we have a million capital spending plan for fiscal which will be expended primarily to million on our new facility see discussion below and will be used to continue to expand our research and development and manufacturing capabilities and upgrade our mis technology 
our operating leases  all on our various facilities in exton  pennsylvania  also represent a significant cash outflow 
lease expense under non cancelable operating leases over the next three years will be as follows  in fiscal   in fiscal and in fiscal to address our current and future facilities requirements  in august we entered into an agreement for the purchase of land and construction of a new facility 
the new facility will be located in chester county  pennsylvania  approximately two miles from our existing location 
long term  the proposed building site will accommodate a  square foot facility and thus provide for our future growth and continued expansion 
our construction plan will have three phases 
phase one will include the construction of a  square foot building shell and the fit out of  square feet of space for our manufacturing and quality assurance operations and personnel 
phase one began in august  and will continue for a period of approximately months and have a total estimated cost of million  including the land purchase 
phase two would increase the total building shell size to  square feet and add another  square feet of fit out and is anticipated to be complete by the end of five years 
the second phase would allow the complete transition of all our personnel and operations to the new facility within five years 
phase three would complete the building to the maximum of  square feet  when necessary 
we intend to finance the construction of this building from current available cash on hand  cash from operations and or liquid investments 
in conjunction with our acquisition of thm in september of  we incurred a note payable to the shareholders of thm in the amount of million the acquisition obligation 
of that amount   remained outstanding as of june  the obligation was due in equal quarterly installments of  which began on december  and is scheduled to end on september  as of february   due to repayments to certain former shareholders of thm  we reduced our remaining quarterly installments to  through september  the cash outflow related to the acquisition obligation will be  in fiscal we have adequate cash balances at june  to repay the remaining amount under this obligation 
the exercise of stock options provided cash of million for the fiscal year ended june  we believe that option exercises will continue through fiscal due to the strength in our share price compared to the average exercise price of outstanding options 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company repurchased and retired  shares of common stock under a board approved repurchase program at a cost of approximately million at an average market price of per share 
we financed the repurchases using our available cash 
on august   we reinstated our stock repurchase plan see reinstatement of stock repurchase program below 
we plan to continue to spend substantial amounts to fund clinical trials  to gain regulatory approvals and to continue to expand research and development activities  particularly for the triactiv system and our biomaterials products 
in addition to the potential cash requirements associated with our announced reinstatement of the stock repurchase plan see below  we will continue to add additional manufacturing facilities to support the continued growth of our biomaterials business and expected commercial launch of the triactiv system  as discussed above 
if approved by the fda  we will market and sell the triactiv system in the us through a small  dedicated direct sales force initially comprised of approximately ten salespeople 
our initial estimates of the cost of a direct sales plan would increase selling expense in fiscal by million to million  including personnel and marketing expenses 
we believe our current cash and investment balances  in addition to cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing and capital requirements through at least the next months 
we also believe our cash and investment balances will be sufficient on a longer term basis  however  it will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development and costs associated with that commercialization  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearance by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of our efforts to expand our manufacturing  sales  and marketing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products 
the terms of any future equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financing may contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects  as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be available to us  or will be available to us on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations short term debt   operating lease obligations     total    see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our short term debt 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these obligations are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our operating leases 
our estimate of the time periods for which our cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund operations is a forward looking statement within the meaning of private securities litigation reform act of and is subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
in addition to those described above  factors which may cause such a difference are set forth under the caption risk factors in this annual report on form k 
research and development tax credit we recorded tax credits of  and  for fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the entire tax credit recorded for and  of the credit related to qualified research and development activities of the company for the period through stock repurchase program on october   we announced that our board of directors had approved a program to repurchase up to  of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock over six months from the date of the board approval 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company repurchased and retired  shares of common stock under the program at a cost of approximately million at an average market price of per share 
we financed the repurchases using our available cash 
on august   we announced that our board of directors had reinstated a program to repurchase issued and outstanding shares of common stock over six months from the date of the board approval 
the current plan calls for the repurchase of up to  shares  the balance under the original plan mentioned above 
as of september   we had repurchased and retired  shares of common stock under the program at a cost of approximately  or an average market price of per share 
we financed the repurchases using our available cash 
we plan to continue to repurchase our shares for cash  from time to time in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
the repurchase program does not require us to purchase any specific dollar value or number of shares 
any purchases under the program will depend on market conditions and may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  in addition to the other information set forth in this report  because they could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition  cash flows and prospects as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
risks related to our business we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the triactiv system in the united states 
the fda has not approved the triactiv system for marketing 
prior to granting approval  the fda may require clarification of information provided in our regulatory submissions  more information or more clinical studies 
if granted  fda approval may impose limitations on the uses for which our product may be marketed or how our product may be marketed 
should we experience delays or be unable to receive approval from the fda  our growth prospects will be diminished 
although we have received ce mark approval and even if we receive fda approval  we may not be successful commercializing the triactiv system through a direct sales force 
if the triactiv system obtains the necessary governmental approvals  we will need to commercialize the product 
we may not be able to successfully develop and train our own sales force to sell and market the triactiv system 
we recently began to build a sales and marketing force  but had no prior experience hiring or training a sales and marketing force 
we may not be able to expand and maintain an internal sales and marketing force with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize the triactiv  our growth prospects will be diminished 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from only two customers 
a substantial majority of our total revenues are derived from only two customers 
royalty income from  and sales of biomaterials to  st 
jude medical associated with the angio seal represented approximately of our total revenue for fiscal while sales of biomaterials products to arthrex  a distributor of orthopaedic products  represented approximately of total revenues 
it is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our products that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for the angio seal from customers of st 
jude medical 
our customer concentration exposes us to the risk of changes in the business condition of either our major customers and to the risk that the loss of a major customer would adversely affect our results of operations 
our relationship with these customers is subject to change at any time 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our revenues will continue to come from the angio seal  which is manufactured  marketed and distributed by st 
jude medical 
under our license agreements with st 
jude medical  the angio seal is manufactured  marketed and sold on a worldwide basis by st 
jude medical 
two of our significant sources of revenue for the future are expected to be sales of collagen to st 
jude medical for use in the angio seal and royalty income from the sale of the angio seal product line 
our success with the angio seal depends in part on the time  effort and attention that st 
jude medical devotes to the angio seal product line and on their success in manufacturing  marketing and selling the angio seal product line 
under the terms of our agreements with st 
jude medical  we have no control over the pricing and marketing strategy for the angio seal product line 
in addition  we depend on st 
jude medical to successfully maintain levels of manufacturing sufficient to meet anticipated demand  abide by applicable manufacturing regulations and seek reimbursement approvals 
st 
jude medical can terminate our arrangement at any time for any reason upon months notice 
at such time  all sales and marketing  manufacturing and distribution rights to the angio seal would be returned to us 
st 
jude medical may not successfully pass future inspections of its manufacturing facility or adequately perform its manufacturing  marketing and selling duties 
any such failure by st 
jude medical may negatively impact angio seal unit sales and therefore reduce our royalties 
if our biomaterials products are not successful  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
the success of our existing biomaterials products  as well as any we develop in the future  depends on a variety of factors  including our ability to continue to manufacture  sell and competitively price these products and the acceptance of these products by the medical profession 
in addition  we may be required to obtain regulatory approval for any future biomaterials products 
we will require substantial additional funds to develop and market our biomaterials products 
we expect to fund the growth of our biomaterials business out of our operating income  but this operating income may not be sufficient to develop new biomaterials products 
to date  we have relied on strategic partners or customers to market and sell our biomaterials products 
we cannot assure you that we will commercialize our products successfully through our planned development of a sales force 
we depend on our customers to market and obtain regulatory approvals for their biomaterials products 
we depend on the efforts of our biomaterials customers in marketing their products that include our biomaterials components 
there can be no assurance that our customers end use products that include our biomaterials components will be commercialized successfully by our customers or that our customers will otherwise be able to compete effectively in their markets 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are likely to become more competitive  and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
the markets for our current and proposed products are fragmented  intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product introductions and enhancements 
we expect that the competitive environment for our products will become more intense as additional companies enter our markets and as new techniques and technologies are adopted 
our biomaterials and medical devices compete directly and indirectly for customers with a range of products and technologies produced by a wide variety of companies  as well as other processes and procedures which do not require the use of our products or those of our competitors 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories in these markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our biomaterials products compete with the products of many of the larger companies in the industry 
in the vascular sealing device market  our products compete with products sold by datascope corporation  perclose  inc a subsidiary of abbott laboratories and vascular solutions  inc  amongst other smaller competitors 
the majority of vascular sealing is performed through manual compression  which represents our primary competition 
the triactiv is currently only commercially available in europe where our competitors include boston scientific corporation  johnson and johnson  inc  medtronic  inc 
which owns percu surge  inc and guidant corporation  among others 
if we are successful in commercializing the triactiv in the us  we anticipate the competitors will be the same companies against which we are competing in europe  as well as others 
our competitors may have broader product lines  which allow them to negotiate exclusive  long term supply contracts and offer comprehensive pricing for their products 
broader product lines may also provide our competitors with a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralized purchasing 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete 
because a significant portion of our revenue depends on sales of medical devices by our customers to the end user market  we are also affected by competition within the markets for these devices 
competition within the medical device market could also have an adverse effect on our business for a variety of reasons  including that our customers may compete directly with larger  dominant manufacturers with extensive product lines and greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
we are also unable to control other factors that may impact the commercialization of our components for end use products  such as marketing and sales efforts and competitive pricing pressures within particular markets 
if our products are not accepted by the medical community or if our products are replaced by new technologies  our business may suffer 
the success of our existing products depends on continued acceptance of these products by the medical community 
we cannot predict whether or not our products will continue to be accepted and if that acceptance will be sustained to over the long term 
the success of any products we develop in the future will depend on the adoption of these products by our targeted markets 
we cannot predict how quickly  if at all  the medical community will accept our future products or the extent to which our future products will be used 
if we encounter difficulties introducing future products into our targeted markets  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
in addition  new technologies and techniques may be developed which may render our current products  along with those under development  obsolete 
the loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors could limit our ability to manufacture our products 
we purchase certain materials and components for our products from various suppliers 
some of these components are custom made for us  including many of our absorbable polymer and suture raw materials which are used in our custom polymer products across all markets 
any loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors may require us to find new vendors 
we could experience production or development delays while we seek new vendors 
we may have problems manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products in the future 
the biomaterials industry is an emerging area  using many materials which are untested or whose properties are still not known 
consequently  from time to time we may experience unanticipated difficulties in manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products to our customers 
these difficulties may include an inability to meet customer demand  delays in delivering products or quality control problems with certain biomaterials products 
our use of hazardous materials exposes us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 
because we use hazardous substances in our research and development and manufacturing operations  we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases or exposures at or from our facility 
decontamination costs  other clean up costs and related damages or liabilities could substantially impair our business and operating results 
we are required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety  including requirements governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
st 
jude medical s and our international sales are subject to a number of risks that could harm future international sales of angio seal and our ability to successfully commercialize new products in international markets 
st 
jude medical sells the angio seal product line internationally and pays us a royalty on each unit sold 
we also sell the triactiv  as well as some of our other products  in the international markets 
our royalties from international sales of the angio seal product line by st 
jude medical and our revenues from our other international sales are subject to several risks  including the impact of recessions in economies both within and outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  fluctuations in exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm st 
jude medical s or our future international sales 
our success depends on key personnel  the loss of whom could impair our operating results and business 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of joseph w 
kaufmann  douglas g 
evans  wendy f 
dicicco and other members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could harm our operating results and business 
in addition  we will not be successful unless we can attract and retain skilled personnel  particularly in the areas of research and product development 
our failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate future acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business 
our operations continue to grow and we expect this expansion to continue as we execute our business strategy 
sustaining our growth has placed significant demands on management and our administrative  operational  information technology  manufacturing  financial and personnel resources 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  client support and financial control systems  and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may not be able to manage our growth successfully 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of any acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that could otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
furthermore  we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary substantially in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including market perception and customer acceptance of our products  market perception and acceptance of our customer s products  our efforts to increase sales of our biomaterials products  our efforts to gain fda approval and commercialize the triactiv  our efforts to gain ce mark and fda approval for future generations of the triactiv device  the loss of significant orders  changes in our relationship with st 
jude medical  our establishment of strategic alliances or acquisitions  timely implementation of new and improved products  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  increased competition  and litigation concerning intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
you should not rely upon our results of operations for any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights  our reputation and competitiveness in the marketplace may be materially damaged 
we regard our patents  biomaterials trade secrets and other intellectual property as important to our success 
we rely upon patent law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and license agreements with st 
jude medical to protect our proprietary rights 
although we have registered certain of our patents with applicable governmental authorities  effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available  and we have not sought protection for our intellectual property in every country where our products may be sold 
the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to ensure that third parties will not infringe or otherwise violate our patents or similar proprietary rights 
we may be accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and any related litigation could materially damage our operating results and business 
third parties may claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings brought against us could prohibit us from selling our products  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
we do not own or control the use of the angio seal device trademark 
the term angio seal is a trademark of st 
jude medical 
all goodwill generated by the marketing and sales of devices bearing the angio seal trademark belongs to st 
jude medical and not to us 
should the st 
jude medical license agreements terminate  we would not have the right to call any of our products angio seal unless we purchase or license the trademark from st 
jude medical 
without rights to the angio seal trademark  we would have to market our products under a different trademark 
moreover  upon the termination of the st 
jude medical license agreements  st 
jude medical would have the right to compete against us by selling collagen and puncture closure devices under the angio seal trademark 
thus  purchasers of puncture closure devices may be more likely to recognize and purchase products labeled angio seal regardless of whether those devices originate from us 
risks related to our industry we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk that human subjects in clinical testing or consumers of the products may suffer serious bodily injury or death due to side effects or other unintended negative reactions to our products 
accordingly  the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of our products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant product liability litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time  attention and resources 
we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we face uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement for our products 
we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payers  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our angio seal products are used 
physicians  hospitals and other users of our products may fail to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payers for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes may occur in governmental and private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for these procedures 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to obtain the approval of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell new products  satisfy these agencies requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials in connection with our existing products  comply with all applicable manufacturing regulations  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products  including the triactiv 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are unable to conform to these regulations  we will be required to locate alternative manufacturers that do conform 
identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers may be a long  costly and difficult process and could seriously harm our business 
the fda and international regulatory agencies may also limit the indications for which our products are approved 
these regulatory agencies may restrict or withdraw approvals we have received if additional information becomes available to support this action 
risks related to our securities the trading price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate substantially in the future 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including our ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements regarding clinical activities or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the medical device industry  changes in our own forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts  our partners ability to meet or exceed the forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical device companies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the market for our stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
as a result  you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price at which you purchase them 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if any securities litigation is initiated against us  with or without merit  we could incur substantial costs  and our management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
future sales of our common stock in the public market by management and other stockholders with significant holdings could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by management or other significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or adversely affect our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may discourage an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of we have based these forward looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends affecting our business 
in this report  the words believe  may  will  estimate  continue  anticipate  intend  expect  plan and similar expressions  as they relate to kensey nash  our business or our management  are intended to identify forward looking statements  but they are not exclusive means of identifying them 
a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors could cause our actual results  performance  financial condition  cash flows  prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  the forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  among other things general economic and business conditions  both nationally and in our markets  the impact of competition  anticipated trends in our business  existing and future regulations affecting our business  strategic alliances and acquisition opportunities  and other risk factors set forth under risk factors above 
except as expressly required by the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise after the date of this report 
our results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments as well as interest paid on our debt 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of high quality us government  municipal and corporate securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities ranging from to years 
also  there are certain municipal variable rate demand obligations that have maturities ranging from to years 
these municipal variable rate demand obligations are putable weekly and callable on a monthly basis 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with secondary or resale markets and we have an audit committee approved investment strategy which currently limits the duration of our investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
at june   our total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments 
while our investments may be sold at anytime because the portfolio includes available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets  we generally hold securities until the earlier of their call date or their maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
we had  in outstanding debt at june   related to the acquisition of thm
