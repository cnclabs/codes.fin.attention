item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a value added manufacturer of quality frozen food products including entrees  plated meals  meal components  soups  sauces  poultry  meat and fish specialties 
we provide custom prepared foods to a number of prominent customers such as panda restaurant group and jenny craig products  and several domestic airlines 
we manufacture products in the retail including weight loss  foodservice and airline industries with branded and private label entrees and components 
we were a owned subsidiary of treecon resources  inc formerly known as polyphase corporation and overhill corporation until the completion of our spin off in october our goal is to be the leading developer and manufacturer of value added food products and provider of custom prepared foods 
we intend to create superior value for our stockholders by continuing to execute our growth and operating strategies 
we employ the following corporate strategies o diversify our customer base  focusing on sectors with attractive growth characteristics  such as foodservice and retail  o invest in and operate efficient production facilities  o provide customer service oriented distribution  o offer a broad range of products to customers in multiple channels of distribution  and o continue to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions and investments 
our net revenues declined an aggregate of over the last two fiscal years 
net revenues declined for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  a reduction in net revenues from airline customers due to the events of september  was largely offset by a increase in foodservice net revenues and a increase in net revenues from retail sales including weight loss for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  we experienced a decline in net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  the decline in net revenues during fiscal year was attributable to a decline in retail sales including weight loss and decreases in sales of approximately to each of our airlines and foodservice customers 
however  during the second half of the fiscal year ended september   we added six new retail customers and two new foodservice customers and achieved revenue growth from these new accounts and from existing accounts in all of our business areas 
we expect future sales growth to be driven primarily by the retail and foodservice areas 
our gross profit declined during fiscal year but then increased during fiscal year the decline in gross profit and decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  was due to manufacturing related inefficiencies experienced with the start up of our new production facility as well as the costs of moving our operations into the new plant 
the increase in gross profit and increase in operating income in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  were due to operating efficiencies resulting from our new production facility and the benefits of the plant consolidation 
we expect further improvement in our operating results from additional manufacturing efficiencies 
our operating income declined during fiscal year but then increased during fiscal year the reduction in operating income for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  was due in part to a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a resulting from increased professional fees  bad debt expense and new product demonstration costs 
the increase in operating income for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  was also due in part to a decline in sg a resulting from reductions in salaries and bad debt expense 
we continue to look for opportunities to further reduce sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
results of operations the tables presented below  which compare our results of operations from one period to another  present the results for each period  the change in those results from one period to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each period as a percentage of net revenues 
the columns present the following 
first two data columns in each table show the absolute results for each period presented 
columns entitled dollar variance and percentage variance show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as positives and unfavorable changes as negatives 
for example  when our net revenues increase from one period to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one period to the next  that change is shown as a negative in both columns 
last two columns in each table show the results for each period as a percentage of net revenues

net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  retail sales  including weight loss  declined  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september   attributable to a decrease of market sales by one of our retail customers 
we added  as a customer  a large multi national food company during fiscal year  which has the potential to replace most of this lost volume in the retail area 
retail sales in the first half of fiscal were also negatively impacted by the southern california grocery strike 
the airline and foodservice sectors experienced modest declines in revenues 
airline net revenues were  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of  the decline in airline sales of in the first half of the fiscal year ended september  compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year was largely due to the impact of the events of september  and was almost entirely offset by improvements in air travel and the addition of new airline customers in the second half of the fiscal year ended september  as evidenced by a increase in net revenues in the second half of fiscal year compared to the same period last year 
foodservice net revenues were  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  american airlines  our largest airline customer  has announced that they will discontinue free meal service in all coach domestic flights beginning february  free meal service will continue for international and domestic first and business class passengers 
although this change will reduce our sales to american airlines  we expect that this reduction in sales will be offset by additional airline customers and products and increases in other business areas 
our current customer list includes six new retail customers and two new foodservice customers added during fiscal we are expanding our sales force and further penetrate these areas and increase our sales opportunities 
gross profit 
despite lower revenues  gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  increased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit margin as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  margin improvement was attributable to our plant consolidation  specifically  reductions in operating supplies  rent expense  interplant freight and outside storage costs which resulted in a  or  decline in cost of sales for the fiscal year ended september  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  to  of net revenues from  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in sg a for the fiscal year resulted primarily from reductions in salaries  the reduced requirement for point of sale product demonstration and promotional activity and decreases in the provision for bad debts 
operating income 
operating income increased  to  for the fiscal year ended september  from  for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in operating income was the result of improvements in gross margins and sg a as noted above 
other expenses 
other expenses for the fiscal year ended september   which consisted primarily of various financing related charges  decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease is due to a  decline in amortization of deferred financing costs to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the amortization expense for fiscal year included the amortization of costs related to previous financing arrangements 
additionally  interest expense decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  all remaining costs associated with previous financing arrangements were written off as debt extinguishment expense as part of the october refinancing 
approximately  of the decline in other expenses was attributable to accruals recorded in estimated for the cost of refurbishing the san diego facility  which was vacated upon expiration of the lease 
we expect to improve on our current operating results  and return to profitable operations  primarily through a improved gross margins achieved by streamlining additional costs and continuing to leverage our consolidated manufacturing and storage facilities to improve manufacturing efficiency  b growing revenues from profitable product lines  c adding higher margin products and d maintaining reduced future interest costs on outstanding debt 
as discussed in risk factors to our business and industry  included elsewhere herein  we may be unable to improve our operating results if we suffer a decline in our manufacturing efficiency  the loss of major customers  declines in air travel  adverse changes in our operating costs or raw materials costs or other adverse changes to our business

gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  was compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was due largely to manufacturing related inefficiencies encountered in connection with the start up of our new plant and the cost of moving our manufacturing operations into the new facility in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a for the fiscal year ended september  increased  to  of net revenues from  of net revenues in the prior fiscal year 
contributing factors to this increase in sg a were increases in new product demonstration costs for our chicago brothers brand products for retail customers  professional fees  including accounting  audit and one time consulting fees related to the april refinancing  compensation and related costs and bad debt expense due to the bankruptcies of united airlines and certain minor customers during other expenses 
other expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  an increase of  
this increase consisted primarily of a  increase in interest expense to  due to an increase in borrowings and borrowing rates during the year primarily related to the april refinancing  and a  increase in amortization of deferred financing costs to  related to the financing costs incurred in the prior year and the bridge financing and the refinancing of the bank debt during fiscal year of the  increase in interest expense   was non cash interest related to the amortization of the original issue discount from the april financing 
the original issue discount represents the difference of approximately  between the fair market value of  shares sold to levine leichtman capital partners ii  lp llcp or senior subordinated creditor and the per share purchase price 
another significant component of other expenses was the  cost of refurbishing our vacated san diego facility upon the expiration of the lease 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash balances and additional financing capacity 
our cash and cash equivalents increased  to  as of september  from  at september  during the fiscal year ended september   our operating activities resulted in a use of cash of  as compared to cash provided of  during fiscal year the use of cash in fiscal year was primarily due to a  increase in accounts receivable  an increase of  in inventories  an increase in prepaid expenses of  and a reduction in accrued expenses of  reduced by increases in cash that resulted from an increase of  in accounts payable and by noncash expenses exceeding net losses by  as of september   we had working capital of  during the fiscal year ended september   our investing activities  comprised of capital expenditures and proceeds from sales of property and equipment  resulted in a net use of cash of approximately  as compared to  during fiscal year the prior year additions to property and equipment related primarily to the consolidation of our operations into our facility in vernon  california 
during the fiscal year ended september   our financing activities resulted in cash provided of approximately  as compared to cash provided of  during fiscal year the cash provided in fiscal year resulted primarily from new borrowings  net of related deferred financing costs  in connection with the debt refinancing in october as discussed below  offset by principal payments during the fiscal year on our long term debt 
as of september   our indebtedness to significant lenders consisted substantially of a secured senior subordinated note payable to llcp in the principal amount of million and two notes payable to pleasant street investors  llc psi  an affiliate of llcp  consisting of senior term a loan in the principal amount of million and senior term b loan in the principal amount of million 
on october   we entered into refinancing arrangements with llcp and psi whereby we issued to llcp a second amended and restated secured senior subordinated note due october  in the stated principal amount of million in exchange for the surrender by llcp of the existing million senior subordinated note and million in additional cash funds 
the replacement note had a base rate of interest that was reduced from to  subject to increase upon the occurrence of an interest rate event  as defined  or event of default  and an extended maturity date from october  to october  we paid llcp amendment and new capital fees in the aggregate amount of  also  as part of the october  refinancing  psi made an additional term loan to us in the principal amount of  and surrendered the note evidencing the existing term a loan in exchange for a second amended and restated senior term a loan in the principal amount of million 
the annual interest rate on the in formula portion of the term a loan was reduced from to 
the annual interest rate on the million term b loan was reduced from to 
the interest rates on the term a loan and term b loan are subject to increase upon the occurrence of any interest rate event  as defined  or event of default as provided in the notes that evidence those loans 
the maturity dates of the term a loan and the term b loan were extended to october  from november  and january   respectively 
the term b loan was modified to be a monthly amortizing term loan 
the prepayment terms of the term a loan and the term b loan were modified to provide  among other things  that we would make mandatory prepayments of annual excess cash flow  if any 
we paid psi amendment and new capital fees in the aggregate amount of the amended and restated securities purchase agreement with llcp and the amended and restated loan and security agreement with psi contain various covenants  including financial covenants covering restrictions on capital expenditures  minimum ebitda and net worth levels  and specified debt service and debt to equity ratios 
in addition  those agreements prohibit changes in control  including ownership and certain management personnel  and contain customary restrictions on incurring indebtedness and liens  making investments  paying dividends and making loans or advances 
the obligations owing by us to psi and llcp are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets 
we did not meet the level a fixed charges requirement of the securities purchase agreement with llcp and the loan and securities agreement with psi at june   which triggered an interest rate event  causing interest rates to increase on all of our debt by 
however  we did meet the level b fixed charges requirement and therefore  no event of default  as defined in the securities purchase and loan documents  occurred 
we did meet all of the other level a requirements  including the ebitda requirement 
the level a fixed charges requirement was not met because of management s decision to make a capital expenditure in the third quarter of fiscal year the capital expenditure was made to secure cost savings and to meet the production requirements of a significant customer 
as a result of the interest rate event  interest rates rose  effective june   as indicated in the table below 
except as described below  the fixed charges requirement is measured quarterly  and increases in interest rates due to an interest rate event remain in effect until the end of the first full quarter in which we meet the fixed charges requirement 
on october   we executed fourth amendments to the existing financing arrangements with psi and llcp to amend the financial covenants and various other provisions 
effective september   the new amendments to the securities purchase agreement with llcp and the loan and securities agreement with psi eliminated  for the fiscal quarters ending january  and april   the potential for a increase in our interest rates like the increase that occurred on june   and reduced the base rate on the term b loan from to libor plus 
in exchange  we agreed to increase our payment of principal on the term b loan from  per month to specified monthly amounts ranging from  to  prior to this amendment  the term b loan was to have a balance of million due at maturity of the loan on october  under this amendment  the term b loan will be entirely paid off by january  the increase in cash required for principal repayment is offset  in part  by savings from the reduction in interest rates

accordingly  based upon projected covenant compliance and as a result of the refinancing of the obligations described above  all principal amounts payable to llcp and to psi  other than currently scheduled principal payments  have been classified as long term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet as of september  in the future  our failure to achieve certain revenue  expense and profitability levels could result in a violation of the amended financial covenants under our financing arrangements and could result in interest rate increases and acceleration of maturity of the loans  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for employee stock options 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for shared based compensation transactions using apb and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas no 
r also requires that tax benefits associated with these share based payments be classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flow rather than operating activities as currently permitted 
sfas no 
r becomes effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  accordingly  we are required to apply sfas no 
r beginning fiscal quarter ended october  sfas no 
r offers alternative methods of adopting this final rule 
at the present time  we have not yet determined which alternative method we will use 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any customers could impact their future ability to satisfy their receivables with us 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
until fiscal  bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  historically were immaterial as we generally transact the substantial portion of our business with large  established food or service related businesses 
for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   our write offs  net of recoveries  to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total net revenues during the last two fiscal years was derived from three customers 
panda restaurant group  jenny craig products and american airlines accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues for the fiscal year ended september  and approximately  and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at september  panda restaurant group  jenny craig products and american airlines accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues for the fiscal year ended september  and approximately  and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at september  we intend to reduce our reliance on a small concentration of accounts by further expansion into custom products for retail and foodservice customers nationwide 
inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we determine the market value of our raw ingredients  finished product and packaging inventories based upon references to current market prices for such items as of the end of each reporting period and record a write down of inventory standard cost to market  when applicable 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation reserve based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a reserve is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for this item 
excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired 
we evaluate the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded during fiscal year at september   we had goodwill of million 
a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
for the one month period from september  to october   the effective date of the spin off  and for all fiscal years up to and including september   we were included in the consolidated federal tax return of our former parent and provided for federal taxes on a separate company basis in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
historically  with respect to state income taxes  primarily in california  we were able to reduce our tax liability by offsetting otherwise taxable income with other losses under the parent entity 
on a separate company basis  we would have had an effective state tax rate of approximately 
for periods following the completion of the spin off  our tax returns are filed on a stand alone basis 
due to operating losses for the year ended september   we recognized an income tax benefit of million and recorded an increase in our deferred tax asset to approximately million on our accompanying balance sheet as of september  we have recorded a  valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets  since we believe that such assets did not meet the more likely than not criteria to be recoverable through projected future profitable operations in the foreseeable future 
should our estimates of future taxable income decline  we may not realize some or all of our remaining deferred tax assets  and we could be required to record a larger valuation allowance against some or all of those assets  which would result in a charge to operations 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on current expectations or beliefs  including  but not limited to  statements concerning our operations and financial performance and condition 
for this purpose  statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature  which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  which include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  projects  forecasts  or similar expressions 
in addition  any statements concerning future financial performance including future revenues  earnings or growth rates  ongoing business strategies or prospects  and possible future company actions  which may be provided by management  are also forward looking statements 
we caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors  including  among others o the impact of competitive products and pricing  o market conditions that may affect the cost of raw material as well as the market for our products  o changes in our business environment  including actions of competitors and changes in customer preferences  as well as disruptions to our customers businesses  such as the southern california grocery strike that occurred during the period from october to february  o the occurrence of acts of terrorism  such as the events of september   or acts of war  o changes in governmental laws and regulations  including income taxes  and o other factors as may be discussed in this report  including those factors described under risk factors related to our business and industry  and other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
risk factors related to our business and industry our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive food industry may affect our operational performance and financial results 
the food industry is highly competitive  and our continued success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry 
we face competition in all of our markets from large  national companies and smaller  regional operators 
some of our competitors  including other diversified food companies  are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do 
from time to time we experience price pressure in certain of our markets as a result of competitors promotional pricing practices as well as market conditions generally 
our ability to reduce costs is limited to the extent efficiencies have already been achieved 
our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains would weaken our competitive position 
competition is based on product quality  distribution effectiveness  brand loyalty  price  effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences 
we may not be able to effectively compete with these larger  more diversified companies 
the loss or consolidation of any of our key customers could adversely affect our financial results by decreasing our existing sales opportunities and prices and increasing our marketing and promotional expenses 
the largest purchasers of our products  panda restaurant group and jenny craig products and american airlines  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total net revenues during the fiscal year ended september  we expect that our sales to these customers will continue to constitute a significant percentage of our net revenues 
the loss of any of these customers as an outlet for our products could adversely affect our competitive position and operating results 
in addition  the acquisition of one of our customers by a third party could adversely affect our financial results if the resulting company chose to terminate their relationship with us and purchase products from our competitors 
additionally  if our customers consolidate and grow larger  our customers may demand lower pricing and more favorable terms 
further  these customers may reduce inventories and increase their use of other suppliers 
if we fail to use our sales  marketing and manufacturing expertise to respond to these trends  our sales volume could be impacted or we may need to lower our prices or increase promotional support of our products  any of which would adversely affect our profitability 
future declines in air travel may adversely affect our revenues  costs and collections 
we derive a significant portion of our business from the airline industry 
in fiscal year  sales to airline customers were approximately million  or of total net revenues  as compared to sales of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  representing and of total net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
additionally  accounts receivable from airline related customers accounted for approximately and of the total accounts receivable balance at september  and september   respectively 
the events of september  significantly reduced our sales to airline customers during fiscal years and and in the first half of fiscal year while we experienced growth in airline sales during the second half of fiscal year and we expect a decline in sales to one of these customers in early fiscal year as discussed elsewhere in this report  the ongoing effect of these events on the airline industry  airline revenues  and on our business in particular  or the impact of a future occurrence of a similar event  cannot be accurately determined and could further adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows by  among other things  decreasing our sales to and making it more difficult to collect receivables from airline customers 
we are subject to cost fluctuations in our operations that may adversely affect our profitability 
our business operations may experience operating cost volatility caused by external conditions  market fluctuations and changes in governmental policies 
any substantial fluctuation in our manufacturing or operating costs  if not offset by product price increases  hedging activities or improved efficiencies  may adversely affect our operating performance  business and financial condition 
we are a major purchaser of many commodities that we use for raw materials and packaging  and price changes for the commodities we depend on may adversely affect our profitability 
the raw materials used in our business are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions  commodity market fluctuations  currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs 
we enter into contracts for the purchase of raw materials at fixed prices  which are designed to protect us against raw material price increases during their term 
however  when necessary  we attempt to recover our commodity cost increases by increasing prices  promoting a higher margin product mix and creating additional operating efficiencies 
we also use paper products  such as corrugated cardboard  aluminum products  and films and plastics to package our products 
substantial fluctuations in prices of packaging materials or higher prices of our raw materials could adversely affect our operating performance and financial results 
commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging costs  and we may be unable to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume  revenue and income 
any substantial fluctuation in the prices of raw materials  if not offset by increases in our sales prices  could adversely affect our profitability 
concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause customers to avoid our products 
we could be adversely affected if our customers and the ultimate consumers of our products lose confidence in the safety and quality of various food products 
adverse publicity about these types of concerns  like the publicity about genetically modified organisms  mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease in europe  whether or not valid  may discourage our customers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 
any negative change in customer perceptions about the safety and quality of our products could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
if our food products become adulterated or misbranded  we would need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured as a result 
food products occasionally contain contaminants due to inherent defects in those products or improper storage or handling 
under adverse circumstances  food manufacturers may need to recall some of their products if they become adulterated or misbranded and may also be liable if the consumption of any of their products causes injury 
while we have never been required to recall any of our products and we maintain insurance that we believe is adequate to cover this type of loss  a widespread product recall could result in changes to one or more of our business processes  product shortages  a loss of customer confidence in our food  or other adverse effects on our business 
if we are required to defend against a product liability claim  whether or not we are found liable under the claim  we could incur substantial costs  our reputation could suffer and our customers might substantially reduce their existing or future orders from us 
our business is subject to federal  state and local government regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial position 
food manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local government entities and agencies 
as a producer of food products for human consumption  our operations are subject to stringent production  packaging  quality  labeling and distribution standards  including regulations mandated by the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
we cannot predict whether future regulation by various federal  state and local governmental entities and agencies would adversely affect our business and financial results 
in addition  our business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of our properties are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment 
we cannot assure that environmental issues relating to presently known matters or identified sites or to other matters or sites will not require additional  currently unanticipated investigation  assessment or expenditures 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  which could harm our competitive position  resulting in decreased revenue 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and competitive position 
accordingly  we devote what we believe are adequate resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights 
we have taken actions to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
however  these actions may be inadequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and proprietary rights by us 
from time to time we license content from third parties 
while we generally require adequate indemnifications  it is possible that in the future we could face infringement actions based upon the content licensed from these third parties 
if any of these claims are proved valid  through litigation or otherwise  we may be required to do any of the following  which could adversely affect our business o cease using the third party trademarks  o acquire other licenses  o develop our own proprietary marks  or o pay financial damages 
some of our significant customer and supplier contracts are short term 
some of our customers and suppliers operate through purchase orders or short term contracts 
though we have long term business relationships with many of our customers and suppliers  we cannot assure that any of these customers or suppliers will continue to do business with us on the same basis 
additionally  though we try to renew these contracts as they come due  there can be no assurance that these customers or suppliers will renew the contracts on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
the termination of any number of these contracts may adversely affect our business and prospects  including our financial performance and results of operations 
our common stock price is subject to significant volatility  which could result in substantial losses for investors and in litigation against us 
during the week period ended december   the high and low sales prices of our common stock on amex were per share and per share  respectively 
prices for our shares are determined in the marketplace and may accordingly be influenced by many factors  including  but not limited to o the depth and liquidity of the market for the shares  o quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  o announcements about our performance as well as the announcements of our competitors about the performance of their business  o investors evaluations of our future prospects and the food industry generally  o changes in earnings estimates by  or failure to meet the expectations of  securities analysts  o our dividend policy  and o general economic and market conditions 
in addition  the stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s attention and resources 
consequently  the price at which investors purchase shares of our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market 
investors may be unable to sell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price  which may result in substantial losses 
our failure to attract and retain key management personnel could adversely affect our business 
our business requires managerial  financial and operational expertise  and our future success depends upon the continued service of key personnel 
as a value added manufacturer of quality frozen food products and customer prepared foods  we operate in a specialized industry 
our key personnel have experience and skills specific to this industry  and there are a limited number of individuals with the relevant experience and skills 
though we have employment agreements with mr 
rudis and mr 
steinbrun  each of these agreements provides for voluntary resignation on the part of the executive prior to the end of the term of the agreement 
if we lose any of our key personnel  our business operations could suffer 
the loss of certain of our executive officers would constitute a change in control and  therefore  an event of default under our securities purchase and loan agreements  and would likely adversely affect our financial condition 
the loss of the services of mr 
rudis or mr 
steinbrun and other key personnel would likely adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition unless and until we were able to locate suitable replacements 
in addition  our securities purchase and loan agreements with llcp  our senior subordinated creditor  and psi  our senior secured creditor  provide that a change in control would occur if mr 
rudis or mr 
steinbrun ceases to have certain management responsibilities in our business  or if mr 
rudis does not continue to hold a minimum number of shares of our common stock 
the occurrence of a change in control would permit llcp to accelerate all indebtedness owing under the senior subordinated note we issued to it and would constitute an event of default under the securities purchase agreement 
llcp would then have the right to require us to immediately repay all of our obligations then owing to it 
we may not have sufficient funds to repay this indebtedness upon an event of default 
accordingly  the occurrence of a change in control could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
any future defaults under our securities purchase and loan agreements could result in increases in applicable interest rates  an acceleration of our indebtedness and a foreclosure on our assets 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure our obligations to psi and llcp 
we have been successful in obtaining waivers  curing defaults or renegotiating the terms of our securities purchase and loan and security agreements in the past 
however  we may become in default or not in compliance with applicable terms in the future 
if that occurs and we are unable to cure the defaults or non compliance  obtain waivers or renegotiate terms  then the interest rates on our indebtedness would increase  our indebtedness could become immediately due and payable  and psi and llcp could foreclose on our assets 
a small group of stockholders beneficially owns a significant amount of our common stock and controls nominations for up to four seats on our board of directors 
after giving effect to the shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants and conversion of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock  our executive officers and directors and stockholders who own greater than of our common stock would own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our amended investor rights agreement with llcp provides that llcp has the right to designate for nomination and election up to three members of our board of directors  together with the right to fill the next available vacancy created on the board of directors  which could result in llcp having up to four representatives on the board at any time 
these stockholders  if acting together  could be able to significantly influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and provisions of nevada law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so could be in our stockholders best interest 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
it could be difficult for a potential bidder to acquire us because our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage takeover attempts 
these provisions may limit stockholders ability to approve a transaction that stockholders may think is in their best interests 
these provisions include a requirement that certain procedures must be followed before matters can be proposed for consideration at meetings of our stockholders and also include the ability of our board of directors to fix the rights and preferences of an issue of shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
provisions of nevada s business combinations statute also restrict certain business combinations with interested stockholders 
we have elected not to be governed by these provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation 
however  this election may not be effective unless we meet certain conditions under the nevada statute 
the provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and nevada law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow the board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value 
however  those provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control
