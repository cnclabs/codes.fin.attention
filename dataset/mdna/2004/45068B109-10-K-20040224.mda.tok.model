item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
general we operate institutes in states which provide technology oriented postsecondary education to approximately  students 
we derive our revenues almost entirely from tuition  course materials  fees and charges paid by  or on behalf of  our students 
most students at our institutes pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses with funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially the federal student financial aid programs under title iv title iv programs of the higher education act of  as amended the hea 
in  we indirectly derived approximately of our revenues  determined on a cash accounting basis as defined by the ed s regulations  from title iv programs 
our revenues vary based on the aggregate student population  which is influenced by the following factors the number of students attending our institutes at the beginning of a fiscal period  the number of new first time students entering and former students re entering our institutes during a fiscal period  student retention rates  and general economic conditions 
new students generally enter our institutes at the beginning of an academic quarter that begins for most programs of study in march  june  september or december 
our establishment of new institutes and the introduction of additional program offerings at our existing institutes have been significant factors in increasing the aggregate student population in recent years 
in order to participate in title iv programs  a new institute must be authorized by the state in which it will operate  accredited by an accrediting commission that the us department of education ed recognizes  and certified by the ed to participate in title iv programs 
the accrediting commission that accredits our institutes grants accreditation to a new institute prior to its first class start date 
the ed s certification process cannot commence until the institute receives its state authorization and accreditation 
in the past  ed certification for a new location generally took approximately nine months from the first class start date 
in the future  however  we do not believe that we will experience much  if any  delay in obtaining ed certification for new locations of the vast majority of our institutes 
we earn tuition revenues on a weekly basis  pro rata over the length of each of four  week academic quarters in each fiscal year 
state regulations  accrediting commission criteria and our policies generally require us to refund a portion of the tuition and fee payments received from a student who withdraws from one of our institutes during an academic quarter 
our statement of income recognizes immediately the amount of tuition and fees  if any  that we may retain after payment of any refund 
previously  if a student withdrew  the tuition revenue related to the remainder of that academic quarter and the fee revenue related to the remainder of the student s program were recorded and the amount of any refund resulting from the application of federal  state or accreditation requirements or our refund policy was recorded as an expense 
for the periods presented  we have reclassified tuition and fee revenue by netting the corresponding revenue and expense related to the remaining tuition and fees with any related refund recorded for students who withdrew 
as a result  revenues and cost of educational services have each been reduced by  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the reclassifications had no impact on our total consolidated results reported in any period presented 
we incur expenses throughout a fiscal period in connection with the operation of our institutes 
the cost of educational services includes faculty and administrative salaries  cost of course materials  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment costs  facilities and leasehold improvements  and certain other administrative costs incurred by our institutes 
student services and administrative expenses include direct marketing costs which are marketing expenses directly related to new student recruitment  indirect marketing expenses  an allowance for doubtful accounts and administrative expenses incurred at our corporate headquarters 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits for recruiting representatives and direct solicitation expenses 
we capitalize our direct marketing costs excluding advertising expenses using the successful efforts method and amortize them on a cost pool by cost pool basis over the period that we expect to receive revenue streams associated with those assets 
we expense as incurred our marketing costs that do not relate to the direct solicitation of potential students 
in  we developed five new resident bachelor degree programs and one new online bachelor degree program 
we began offering one or more of these new bachelor degree programs at of our institutes in in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  in  we developed three new resident bachelor programs  three new resident associate degree programs and one new online master degree program 
in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  we also expanded the use of the hybrid delivery model to several additional institutes in we opened one new institute in  four new institutes in and three new institutes in we plan to open three or four new institutes and two or three learning sites in our new institutes have historically incurred a loss during the month period after the first class start date 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
we include all property and equipment in the financial statements at cost and make provisions for depreciation of property and equipment using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives generally range from three to ten years for our furniture and equipment  three to years for leasehold improvements  to years for the buildings and three to eight years for capitalized software 
changes in circumstances  such as changes in our curricula and technological advances  may result in the actual useful lives of our property  equipment and capitalized software differing from our estimates 
we regularly review and evaluate the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment and capitalized software 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from our assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
recognition of revenues 
tuition revenues are recorded on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable course 
if a student withdraws from an institute  the standards of most state education authorities that regulate our institutes  the accrediting commission that accredits our institutes and our own internal policy limit a student s obligation for tuition and fees to the institute depending on when a student withdraws during an academic quarter refund policies 
the terms of the refund policies vary by state  and the limitations imposed by the refund policies are generally based on the portion of the academic quarter that has elapsed at the time the student withdraws 
the greater the portion of the academic quarter that has elapsed at the time the student withdraws  the greater the student s obligation is to the institute for the tuition and fees related to that academic quarter 
we record revenues net of any refunds paid as a result of any applicable refund policy 
on an individual student basis  tuition earned in excess of cash received is recorded as accounts receivable  and cash received in excess of tuition earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
textbook sales and the related cost of the textbooks are recognized at the beginning of each academic quarter with respect to students who are attending courses in which textbooks are charged separately from tuition 
for those students who are attending courses in which the cost of textbooks is included in the tuition  the cost of the textbooks is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable course length and the deferral of textbook costs is recorded in prepaids and other current assets 
academic fees which are charged only one time to students on their first day of class attendance and admission processing fees which are charged only one time to students upon being evaluated for admission to their programs of study are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the average course length of months 
if a student withdraws from an institute  all unrecognized revenue relating to his or her fees  net of any refunds paid as a result of any applicable refund policy  is recognized upon the student s departure 
more than of our revenues represent tuition charges and less than of our revenues represent bookstore sales and student fees 
the amount of tuition earned depends on the cost per credit hour of the courses in the program  the number of courses in the program  how long a student remains enrolled in the program  how many program courses a student takes during each period of enrollment in the program  and the total number of students enrolled in each program 
each of these factors is known at the time our tuition revenues are calculated and is not subject to estimation 
direct marketing costs 
direct costs incurred relating to the enrollment of new students are capitalized using the successful efforts method 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits of recruiting representatives and other direct costs less admission processing fees 
successful efforts is the ratio of students enrolled to prospective students interviewed 
the higher the rate of interviewed students who enroll  the greater the percentage of our direct marketing costs that are capitalized 
we amortize our direct marketing costs on a cost pool by cost pool basis over the period that we expect to receive revenue streams associated with those assets 
the direct costs subject to capitalization are readily quantifiable and are not subject to estimation 
the amortization method is based on historical trends of student enrollment and retention activity and is not subject to significant assumptions 
we regularly evaluate the future recoverability of these deferred costs

variations in quarterly results of operations our quarterly results of operations have tended to fluctuate within a fiscal year due to the timing of student matriculations 
each of our four fiscal quarters have weeks of earned tuition revenue 
revenues in our third and fourth fiscal quarters generally benefit from increased student matriculations 
the number of new students entering our institutes tends to be substantially higher in june of all new students in and september of all new students in because of the significant number of recent high school graduates entering our institutes for the academic quarters beginning in those two months 
the academic schedule generally does not affect our incurrence of costs  however  and costs do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth our revenues in each fiscal quarter of  and quarterly revenue dollars in thousands three months ended amount percent amount percent amount percent march june september december total for year results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain statement of income data to revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues cost of educational services student services and administrative expenses operating income interest income  net income before income taxes the following table sets forth our total student enrollment as of december   and as of december  total student enrollment increase over prior year the following table sets forth total new student enrollment during the years ended december   and for the year ended december  total new student enrollment increase over prior year we generally organize the academic schedule for programs of study offered at our institutes on the basis of four week academic quarters in a calendar year that typically begin in march  june  september and december 
to measure the persistence of our students  the number of continuing students in any academic quarter is divided by the total student enrollment as of the end of the immediate preceding academic quarter 
a continuing student is any student who  in any academic quarter  is enrolled in a program of study at an itt technical institute and was enrolled in the same program at any itt technical institute at the end of the immediate preceding academic quarter 
total student enrollment includes all new and continuing students enrolled at our itt technical institutes at the end of an academic quarter 
the following table sets forth the rates of our students persistence for each quarter in  and for the three months ended  march june sept dec year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in tuition rates in march  a increase in the total student enrollment at december  compared to december   and a increase in total new student enrollment at our institutes in compared to  which is primarily a result of opening new institutes  an increased number of responses to our marketing and advertising  and operational changes that increased the percentage of new student enrollments arising from those responses 
cost of educational services 
cost of educational services increased million  or  to million in from million in the principal causes of this increase included the costs required to service the increased enrollment  normal inflationary cost increases for wages  rent and other costs of services  and increased costs due to opening new institutes one opened in june  three opened in september  one opened in march  one opened in june and one opened in december 
cost of educational services as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the primary causes of this decrease include continued facility and faculty utilization efficiencies  certain fixed costs at our institutes did not increase proportionately with increases in our revenues resulting from increased student enrollment  new and renegotiated vendor contracts  a net reduction of occupancy costs resulting from our purchase of facilities that we had previously leased six were purchased during the three months ended september  and six were purchased during the year ended december   and changes in indiana tax law that caused the classification of certain indiana taxes to be changed from cost of educational services to income taxes 
student services and administrative expenses 
student services and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in student services and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues in compared to of revenues in  primarily due to a increase in media advertising expenses offset by a reduction in bad debt expense from of revenues for to of revenues for operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in the operating margin increased to of revenues in from in  primarily due to continued facility and faculty utilization efficiencies  new and renegotiated vendor contracts  a net reduction of occupancy costs resulting from our purchase of facilities over the last eighteen months  a reduction in bad debt expense  and a change in the classification of certain indiana taxes based on changes in indiana tax law 
income taxes 
our combined effective federal and state income tax rate in was compared to in  primarily due to changes in indiana and other state tax laws 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in tuition rates in march  an increase in the total student enrollment at december  compared to december   and a increase in new student enrollment at our institutes in compared to cost of educational services 
cost of educational services increased million  or  to million in from million in the principal causes of this increase included the costs required to service the increased student enrollment  normal inflationary cost increases for wages  rent and other costs of services  and increased costs due to opening new institutes one opened in march  one opened in june and three opened in september 
cost of educational services as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to the greater facility and faculty utilization efficiencies associated with the three day per week class schedule of our information technology  computer and electronics engineering technology and computer drafting and design programs  and because certain fixed costs at our institutes did not increase proportionately with increases in our revenues resulting from increased student enrollment 
student services and administrative expenses 
student services and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in student services and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in compared to of revenues in  primarily due to a increase in media advertising expenses offset by a reduction in bad debt expense from of revenues for to of revenues for income taxes 
our combined effective federal and state income tax rate in was compared to in liquidity and capital resources in  we indirectly derived approximately of our revenues  determined on a cash accounting basis as defined by the ed s regulations  from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year  which consists of three academic quarters 
loan funds are generally provided by lenders in three disbursements for each academic year 
the first disbursement is usually received either days after in the case of students commencing a program of study or ten days before the start of the first academic quarter of a student s academic year  and the second and third disbursements are typically received ten days before the start of each subsequent quarter of a student s academic year 
while the timing of loan disbursements to us is subject to a student s directions to the lender and to existing regulatory requirements regarding such disbursements  we have typically received student loan funds upon the lender s disbursement of the student loan funds 
on may   we declared a two for one split of our common stock  effected on june  by payment of a stock dividend to all shareholders of record at the close of business on may  of one share on each one share of our common stock issued and outstanding or held as treasury stock on may  stock split 
our earnings per share amounts and the number of shares in all prior periods have been restated to reflect the stock split 
on january   our board of directors approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of itt esi common stock from  to  amendment 
if the amendment is approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting of shareholders  it will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment with the delaware secretary of state 
our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the following table sets forth the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock during  and year ended december  number of shares repurchased total cost of shares repurchased in millions average cost per share all of the repurchased shares of our common stock became treasury shares upon repurchase and most of the repurchased shares continue to be held as treasury shares 
as of december   our existing repurchase authorization permits us to repurchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
we may elect to repurchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the future  depending on market conditions and other considerations 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help us achieve our long term goal of enhancing shareholder value 
our principal uses of cash are to pay salaries  occupancy and equipment costs  recruiting and marketing expenses  administrative expenses and taxes  including institute start up costs for new institutes 
our net cash items consisting of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments short term and non current increased from million at december  to million at december  cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and investments ranged from a low of million in february to a high of million in december we have generated positive cash flows from operations for the past five years 
cash flows from operations in were million  an increase of million from million in this increase was primarily due to higher cash flows from operations caused by implementation of effective cash management strategies and an increase in income and accelerated cash collections from students associated with their use of supplemental private loan programs 
these private loan programs offer eligible students and their parents loans to help pay the students cost of education that federal and state student financial aid sources do not fully cover 
the private loan programs are non recourse to us and are disbursed once during each academic year at the start of the first academic quarter of the student s academic year 
during the six months ended december   we purchased million of investments that we plan to hold until maturity 
the maturity dates extend beyond one year  but not more than three years for million of those investments 
at december   we had positive working capital of million 
deferred revenue  which represents the cash received from students in excess of tuition earned  increased million to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the students use of supplemental private loans and increased tuition revenue resulting from higher tuition rates and increased enrollment 
during  we recorded a million minimum pension liability adjustment with respect to our obligations under the esi pension plan and a corresponding million reduction in shareholders equity  which is net of a million deferred tax asset 
during  we reduced our minimum pension liability by million as a result of obtaining an investment return on plan assets in excess of our original estimates  and we recorded a corresponding million increase in shareholders equity  which is net of a million deferred tax asset 
an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the title iv programs  if the rates at which the institution s students default on federal student loans exceed specific percentages 
an institution whose cohort default rate on loans under the federal family education loan ffel program and the william d 
ford federal direct loan fdl program is or greater for three consecutive federal fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in the ffel  fdl and pell grant programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the ed determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years 
none of our campus groups had a ffel fdl cohort default rate equal to or greater than for the  or federal fiscal years  the most recent years for which the ed has published ffel fdl official cohort default rates 
none of our campus groups had a ffel fdl preliminary cohort default rate equal to or greater than for the federal fiscal year  which preliminary rates were issued by the ed in february the standards of most of the state education authorities that regulate our institutes the seas and the accrediting council for independent colleges and schools acics that accredits our institutes limit how much of a student s tuition and fees an institution can retain for a student who withdraws from the institution refund policy 
the hea and its implementing regulations impose a limit on the amount of title iv program funds withdrawing students can use to pay their education costs return policy 
the return policy permits a student to use only a pro rata portion of the title iv program funds that the student would otherwise be eligible to use  if the student withdraws during the first of any period of enrollment 
the institution must return to the appropriate lenders or the ed any title iv program funds that the institution receives on behalf of a withdrawing student in excess of the amount the student can use for such period of enrollment 
depending on when a student withdraws during an academic quarter  the hea s return policy can reduce the amount of title iv program funds that the withdrawing student can use to pay his or her education costs owed to the itt technical institute 
in these instances  withdrawing students may be unable to pay all of their education costs that would have been paid by the title iv program funds that were returned and we may be unable to collect a significant portion of those costs 
our students use of supplemental private loans has improved our collection of the students education costs 
under a provision of the hea commonly referred to as the rule  a for profit institution  such as each of our campus groups  becomes ineligible to participate in title iv programs if  on a cash accounting basis  the institution derives more than of its applicable revenues for a fiscal year from title iv programs 
for our fiscal year  the range of our campus groups was from approximately to approximately 
during  we purchased the facilities of six of our institutes for a total of million 
we previously leased these facilities under operating lease agreements 
we may purchase additional facilities of our institutes in our capital assets  other than our facilities discussed above  consist primarily of classroom and laboratory equipment such as computers  electronic equipment and robotic systems  classroom and office furniture  software and leasehold improvements 
capital expenditures  excluding facility purchases  totaled million during and primarily included expenditures of million for new itt technical institutes and million to replace or add furniture  equipment or computers  or leasehold improvements 
leasehold improvements represent part of our continuing effort to maintain our existing facilities in good condition 
excluding facility purchases  the amount of capital expenditures in were comparable to to date  cash generated from operations has been sufficient to meet our capital expenditures 
we plan to continue to upgrade and expand current facilities and equipment 
we expect that capital expenditures will be approximately to million 
the capital additions for a new institute are approximately million 
we anticipate that our planned capital additions can be funded from cash flows from operations 
cash flows on a long term basis are highly dependent upon the receipt of title iv program funds and the amount of funds spent on new institutes  curricula additions at existing institutes and possible acquisitions 
we do not believe that any reduction in cash and cash equivalents or investments that may result from their use to effect any future stock repurchases or facility purchases will have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans  planned capital expenditures  ability to meet any applicable regulatory financial responsibility standards  or ability to conduct normal operations 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the specified contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements 
a majority of the operating leases contain renewal options that can be exercised after the initial lease term 
renewal options are generally for periods of one to five years 
all operating leases will expire over the next years and management expects that those leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases in the normal course of business  or that we will purchase the facilities represented by those leases or other facilities where we can operate our institutes 
there are no material restrictions imposed by the lease agreements  and we have not entered into any significant guarantees related to the leases 
we are required to make additional payments under the operating lease terms for taxes  insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  except for the operating lease agreements disclosed above  or any other significant long term obligations  lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 
there are no commitments or guarantees that provide for the potential issuance of shares of our common stock  other than pursuant to the terms of the stock option plans for our employees and non employee directors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments with original maturity dates of less than days are included in cash and cash equivalents and are recorded at cost  which approximates market value 
our investments classified as trading securities that have maturity dates in excess of days at the time of purchase are recorded at their market value and are included in short term investments 
our investments classified as held to maturity include investments that are recorded at their amortized cost 
short term investments have maturity dates within one year following the balance sheet date 
our non current investments have maturity dates between one and three years following the balance sheet date 
we estimate that the market risk associated with our investments in marketable debt securities can best be measured by a potential decrease in the fair value of these securities resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
if such a hypothetical increase in rates were to occur  the reduction in the market value of our portfolio of securities would not be material
