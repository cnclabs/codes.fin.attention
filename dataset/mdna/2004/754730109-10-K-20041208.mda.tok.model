item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview the company s overall financial results continue to be highly and directly correlated to the direction of the equity markets 
each of the company s three largest business segments has significant operating leverage that is generally evident when the equity markets rise 
while these markets were strong for only a little more than half of fiscal  the company achieved record revenues and earnings as a result of organizational and operational improvements undertaken during the market downturn in there were several factors which depressed investor activity during the last half of fiscal the anticipation of rising interest rates dampened the demand for fixed income products  and the federal reserve commenced a series of rate hikes during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the demanding regulatory environment remained in the spotlight and focused on the financial services industry  resulting in an increase in the cost of compliance and also impacting public trust and confidence 
finally  there was uncertainty over the then upcoming presidential election and the various economic policies which might be endorsed

net revenues rose  as interest expense grew only 
scattered throughout several segments  net interest earnings continue to be an important source of profits to the company see the chart below 
significantly  the upward trend of the equity markets during most of fiscal led many individual investors to return to the market  which in turn led to a steady rise in margin debits throughout the year 
these balances are the company s best interest spread product  as the risk is well controlled and they are funded by relatively low cost client funds awaiting investment 
margin loan growth is largely responsible for the overall improvement in net interest income

as a result  net income rose to a record million  or per diluted share 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  total company total revenues declined million  or  for fiscal year  however  taking into consideration the decrease in interest expense  net revenues total revenues less interest expense actually increased by million  or 
both interest revenue and interest expense were down in the current year  resulting in a decline of million in net interest income 
the decrease is primarily due to declining interest rates  combined with lower margin and stock borrowed loaned balances  net of increased cash deposited with the company by brokerage clients see the chart below 
the decline in margin balances is attributed to the economic environment and the poor performance of the securities markets through the first half of fisc al year  which resulted in customers generally not committing new investment funds to the securities market and a tendency to reduce risk by employing less margin borrowing 
the equity market conditions also led to a continued decline in the security lending business  as the sluggish securities market resulted in depressed demand for securities 
the modest decline in net interest income was offset by increases in financial service fees and other revenue of million and million  respectively 
the increase in financial service fees was driven by increased fees from the addition of ira  passport  and freedom accounts the latter two being wrap fee accounts which generate transaction processing fees for trades executed  as well as higher money market processing fees driven by the increase in the company s money market assets in the current year 
the increase in earnings is attributable primarily to the first quarter gain of million from the sale of rj ltd 
s shares of tsx formerly its toronto stock exchange seats and an increase of million in mutual fund networking fees  which is due to an increased number of accounts with networked mutu al fund companies which pay the company to include their fund positions and activity on the brokerage statements  thus eliminating the need for the mutual fund companies to send confirmations and statements to their clients 
net income increased million  or  to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in earnings is primarily attributable to a decrease in net litigation reserve expense in the current year  as the increase in compensation expense offset the increase in net revenues

first  there was a modest net increase in financial advisor headcount of  or  to  in our wholly owned subsidiaries 
more importantly  the process of upgrading the sales force by terminating lower producers continued in earnest 
thus  the overall composition of the sales force was improved from the prior year 
finally  there were months of strong market activity during as compared to approximately strong months in the aforementioned improved quality of the sales force amplified the effect on revenues of the longer duration of good market conditions 
the improved interest spread was due to the steady rise in margin debits throughout the year 
the increase in financial service fees was a result of the increased number of transaction fees from trades in fee based accounts and a higher amount of ira fees as the number of such accounts grew 
other revenues increased due to higher mutual fund networking fees and greater meeting sponsorship revenues 
administrative compensation costs reflect increased home office staffing in the domestic independent contractor subsidiary and higher incentive compensation accruals as profits were significantly improved 
business development expenses rose due primarily to the cost of promoting the advisorchoice platform 
most notably  other expenses  including legal expenses and reserves  declined by one third from the prior year 
as is the case in all of the company s major businesses  there is significant operating leverage in the private client group  particularly with increases in financial advisor average production 
accordingly  the increase in net revenues led to a surge in pretax income of 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  private client group private client group total revenues increased by approximately million for fiscal year  with net revenues increasing by million 
the increase in net revenues is attributed to the modest increase in commissions and the gains in financial service fees and other  offset by a decrease in net interest income 
the increase in commission revenue is primarily attributable to improved market conditions in the second half of fiscal  which resulted in retail investors  who had been reluctant to invest during fiscal year and the first half of fiscal  returning to the securities market with a renewed interest in both equity and fixed income products 
additionally  in the second half of fiscal there were two consecutive quarters of increased assets in fee based accounts 
as the individual fee based accounts are billed on beginning of quarter balances  this increase in assets resulted in increased revenue only for the fourth quarter of in addition  there was an increase in commissions from investment banking activity  which is due to an increase in the number and dollar volume of lead and co managed public equity offerings in the current year for more information on investment banking activities see the results of operations capital markets discussion below 
the increase in financial service fees is attributable to the aforementioned increase in fees from additional ira  passport  and freedom accounts  as well as the increased fees received by the broker dealer subsidiaries for the distribution of mo ney market accounts and mutual funds 
the increase in other revenue is primarily due to an increase in service fees received from mutual fund companies which serve to partially reimburse the company for its processing costs related to items such as statement preparation and tax reporting 
the decrease in net interest income of million is attributable to declining interest rates  as well as declining average margin balances and segregated assets  offset by declining payables under the client interest program 
pre tax earnings for the private client group were consistent with the prior year  reflecting the increase in net revenues offset by an increase in sales commission expense and other compensation expenses of million and million  respectively 
commission expense increased due to the increase in independent contractor revenue  on which there is a higher payout to financial advisors than to employee financial advisors 
the higher payout is used to offset the independent contractor financial advisors responsibility to cover their own branch operating expenses  which are paid by the company in the employee model

most notably  the company was lead or co manager for public offerings for the year  nearly double the number in  as market conditions were conducive for several of the industries on which these efforts are focused 
this deal flow was a major contributing factor to the increase in institutional equity sales commissions 
the decline in fixed income commissions reflects investors hesitancy to commit funds while anticipating a rising interest rate environment 
the rise in interest expense represents the financing costs of the higher average fixed income inventory balances 
commission expense was nearly flat despite the rise in commission revenues as fixed income commissions carry a higher payout than equities 
the increase in administrative expense is primarily attributable to higher profit based incentive compensation in equity capital markets departments 
the operating leverage in this segment was dramatic as the average production of institutional equity salesmen  sales traders and investment bankers rose sharply 
as a result  record profits of million were higher than in the prior year 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  capital markets although net revenues for the capital markets segment were down slightly from the prior year  the fixed income portion of this segment continued to perform well in institutional sales commissions excluding underwriting sales credits which declined remained strong and were up by over the prior year  driven by increases in sales of over the counter equity and a variety of fixed income securities 
also  the company has continued to grow its business in the syndication of investment partnerships designed to yield returns in the form of low income housing tax credits  which resulted in an increase in revenue of million in equity investment banking  however  experienced mixed results in the current year 
the number of us lead and co managed underwritings increased to from in the prior year  w hile the dollar volume of these transactions increased to billion from billion 
as a result  underwriting fees increased by million 
the increase in underwriting transactions  however  did not translate into an equivalent increase in underwriting sales commissions as the company acted as the lead manager on fewer deals in the current year 
additionally  investment banking was negatively affected by lower merger and acquisition fees  which declined million due to the combination of one large transaction in canada during the prior year and a general decline in the company s merger and acquisition activity 
volatility in interest rates resulted in a decrease in trading profits in  driven primarily by declines in taxable fixed income products 
pre tax earnings for the capital markets segment were down slightly from the prior year due to the million decrease in net revenues offset by a million reduction in expenses 
the primary contributor to the reduction in expenses was compensation  with sales commissions decreasing by million and administrative and other compensation increasing by million 
the decline in commission expense is due to lower underwriting sales credits  while the increase in other compensation is primarily attributed to concentrated efforts to grow the public finance department  as well as the formation of a structured finance department in the current year

in addition  the company earned approximately  more in performance fees from managed hedge funds than in the prior year 
money market fund balances were the only category that declined  as investors gained confidence in the equity markets and shifted some of these funds accordingly 
the increase in administrative expense relates primarily to performance based and profit based incentive compensation accruals 
once again  operating leverage was evident as a modest increase in revenues led to significant rise in pretax income 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  asset management revenues for the asset management segment declined million 
slightly more than half of the company s assets under management are billed based on beginning of quarter balances  the average beginning of the quarter balances for those assets was million lower during fiscal year than during fiscal year the remaining assets under management are billed based on average daily balances 
the average balance for those assets increased million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the combined effect of the changes in assets under management resulted in the decrease in investment advisory fees of million  or 
nearly all of the portfolio managers at eagle asset management continue to outperform their benchmark averages  resulting in positive net s ales 
additionally  heritage s funds continued to perform well during fiscal for the year ended september  assets under management increased  which is comprised of both positive net sales and market appreciation 
the overall segment s pre tax income declined at a slower rate than revenues due to cost control measures implemented in the current year  which have held compensation flat and reduced operating expenses

in s interest income and expense interest income interest expense net interest income other income net revenues non interest expense employee compensation and benefits communications and information processing occupancy and equipment other total non interest expense pre tax earnings year ended september  compared with the year ended september  rjbank the improvement in net interest income was a result of further progress in loan growth as a percentage of total assets 
the decline in other income reflects the slowdown of refinancing activity  which led to fewer mortgage originations and lower fees from the subsequent sales of originated fixed rate loans 
the increase in other expense encompasses a million higher provision for loan losses due to the increased levels of purchased whole loan pools and outstanding commercial loan balances 
rjbank s policy is to maintain a substantially duration matched portfolio of assets and liabilities 
as the vast majority of liabilities are floating rate demand deposits  certain asset purchases are hedged through entering into interest rate swap contracts 
interest spreads have been negatively impacted by the effect of interest rate swaps which were put in place several years ago to hedge fixed rate assets against interest rate increases  substantially all of these contracts expire by the end of calendar the combination of the factors discussed above resulted in a decline in pretax income 
as mentioned in previous years  current results are negatively impacted during periods of significant net loan growth as a provision for loan losses is recorded in the period of origination or purchase  while the benefit of the higher interest earnings is recognized over subsequent periods 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  rjbank interest rates continued to fall during  which resulted in lower mortgage rates and continued refinancings 
heavy prepayments due to refinancings affected both the residential loan portfolio and mortgage backed securities 
as a result  portfolio loans and investments continued to be replaced with lower yielding assets 
however  rjbank increased its loans as a percent of total assets from at september to at september loans produce a higher yield than mortgage backed securities  which has allowed rjbank to reduce the impact of the decline in interest rates 
additionally  interest rates began to stabilize in the second half of fiscal  resulting in an increase in interest spreads to an average of for fiscal versus for fiscal non interest income increased by approximate ly in the current year due to income from the sale of originated fixed rate mortgage loans  which increased over the prior year 
rjbank has controlled non interest expenses during the current year  with those expenses increasing at a rate significantly below the increase in net revenues 
the only significant increase in non interest expense in was employee compensation  which increased due to an increase in staffing to meet the demands of heavier volume in retail lending and to further develop the commercial lending department 
net revenues per employee  however  increased by over the prior year 
the combination of managing loan runoff  the stabilization of interest rates  increases in fee income from loans sold  and the emphasis on cost control resulted in a million increase in pre tax earnings in fiscal results of operations other the following table presents consolidated financial information for the other segment for the years indicated for the years ended september  incr

other income reflects the improved performance of the company s consolidated joint ventures in emerging markets  particularly in turkey 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  other net interest income was relatively flat with the prior year 
the overall decrease in gross interest income and interest expense is attributable to a sluggish equity market  which depressed demand for securities lending activity  as evidenced by the decline in the average balance of stocks borrowed loaned 
additionally  the average interest rates earned charged on stock borrowed loaned transactions declined by  contributing further to the current year reduction in gross interest income and expense 
other income decreased by due to a decline in income from the company s international joint ventures  offset by the current year gain of million on the sale of rj ltd

critical accounting policies the following is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies 
for a full description of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understandin g the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of securities and other assets trading account securities and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statement of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument

for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the company uses estimated fair values as determined by management 
the following table presents the carrying value of cash trading and available for sale securities for which fair value is measured based on quoted prices or other independent sources versus those for which fair value is determined by management september  financial instruments owned financial instruments sold but not yet purchased in s fair value based on quoted prices and independent sources fair value determined by management total derivative contracts fair value for derivative contracts  consisting primarily of interest rate swaps  are obtained from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
investment in leveraged leases the company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines delta and continental 
the company s combined equity investments represented of the aggregate purchase prices  the remaining was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates 
the residual values of the aircrafts at the end of an average lease term of years are projected to be an average of of the original cost 
the leases expire in september and june  respectively 
the company s ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines ability to fulfill its lease obligations 
in the event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the company is unable to re lease or sell the planes with adequate terms  the company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge related to its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to delta airlines 
although delta has not defaulted on its obligations under this lease  delta s financial condition has continued to deteriorate 
if the situation worsens  additional charges may be recorded in future periods to further write down the remaining investment balance for this lease of million 
goodwill intangible assets consist predominantly of goodwill related to the acquisitions of roney co 
now part of rja and goepel mcdermid  inc now called raymond james ltd 
this goodwill  totaling million  was allocated to the reporting units within the private client group and capital markets segments pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
the company reviews its goodwill on at least an annual basis in order to determine whether its value is impaired 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
when available  the company uses recent  comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units 
the company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues  earnings  and book value of comparable transactions 
however  when such comparable transactions are not available or have become outdated  the company uses discounted cash flow scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
as of september   goodwill had been allocated to the following reporting units as identified by the company the private client group of rja  as well as  the private client group and capital markets segments of rj ltd 
as of the most recent impairment test  the company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired 
however  changes in current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as required  the company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in other payables 
such reserves are established and maintained in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and financial interpretation no 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an associate of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
lastly  each case is review to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply  in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may prove to be incorrect  which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined 
the company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables and loans 
client receivables at the broker dealers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients 
therefore  when a receivable is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral  which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker dealer price quotations 
client loans at rjbank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property 
rjbank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by a creditor for impairment of a loan 
the calculation of the sfas no 
allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio into different classes and assigns each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans 
the factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve pe rcentage to each class include trends in delinquencies  volume and terms  changes in geographic distribution  lending policies  local  regional  and national economic conditions  and past loss history 
for individual loans identified as impaired  rjbank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
at september   the amortized cost of all rjbank loans was million and an allowance for loan losses of million was recorded against that balance 
the allowance for loan losses is approximately of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio and has not changed significantly since the prior year 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors  primarily for recruiting and retention purposes 
the company provides for a general allowance for loan losses on such receivables based on historical collection experience 
additionally  the company provides for a specific reserve on these receivables if a financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
at september  the receivable from financial advisors was million  which is net of an allowance of million for estimated uncollectibility 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities during fiscal was approximately million 
cash was provided by earnings and increased client cash balances

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risks are an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
management of these risks is critical to the company s fiscal soundness and profitability 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in the company s business activities are market  credit  operational  and regulatory and legal 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss to the company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the company has exposure to market risk primarily through its broker dealer and banking operations 
the company s broker dealer subsidiaries trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations and act as an active market maker in approximately over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  the company maintains inventories in order to ensure availability of securities and to facilitate client transactions 
additionally  the company  primarily within its canadian broker dealer subsidiary  invests for its own proprietary equity investment account 
the following table represents the carrying value of trading inventories as of fiscal year end associated with the company s broker dealer client facilitation  market making activities and proprietary trading activities september  september  securities securities sold but sold but trading not yet trading not yet securities purchased securities purchased in s marketable municipal corporate government total debt securities equity other securities total changes in value of the company s trading inventory may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings of the issuer  equity prices and the correlation among these factors 
the company manages its trading inventory by product type and has established trading divisions that have responsibility for each product type 
the company s primary method of controlling risk in its trading inventory is through the use of limits 
as of september   the absolute total long positions plus total short positions fixed income and total net positions equity inventory limits were  and  respectiv ely 
the company s total outstanding trading inventories were well within these limits at september  additionally  for its derivative activities  primarily interest rate swaps  the company has established a limit structure that is based on factors such as interest rate risk and spread exposure 
position limits in trading inventory accounts are monitored on a daily basis 
consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to senior management 
limit violations are carefully monitored 
management monitors inventory levels and trading results  as well as inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
summarized results are reviewed and a valuation adjustment is determined by management to record the instrument at estimated fair value 
interest rate risk rjbank maintains an investment portfolio that is comprised of mortgage backed securities  as well as mortgage  consumer and commercial loans 
those investments are funded in part by its client obligations  including demand deposits  money market accounts  savings accounts  and certificates of deposit 
based on the banking industry and the current investment portfolio of rjbank  market risk for rjbank is limited primarily to interest rate risk 
rjbank reviews interest rate risk based on net interest income  which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid 
the following table represents the carrying value of rjbank s assets and liabilities that are subject to market risk 
rjbank financial instruments with market risk september  september  in s debt securities mortgage backed securities municipal obligations total debt securities loans available for sale equity securities total assets with market risk certificates of deposit federal home loan bank advances total liabilities with market risk rja is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining trading inventories of fixed income instruments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company monitors  on a daily basis  the value at risk var in its institutional fixed income trading portfolios cash instruments and interest rate derivatives held either as economic hedges or as customer related positions 
using a variance covariance methodology  var is a technique for estima ting the potential loss in the company s fixed income portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
a standard regulatory type data set is used one year historical observation period  exponential decay and the results are compared daily against those obtained using corresponding data with a exponential decay factor 
var is reported at a confidence level  based on a day holding period  this is consistent with the company s high turnover trading activity  which is based on supporting client sales activity 
this means that there is a one in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
however  shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon  such as a number of consecutive trading days 
the following table sets forth the high  low and average var for the company s overall portfolio during the fiscal year ended september   with the corresponding dollar value of the company s portfolio highest daily var lowest daily var daily averages var portfolio value net var as a percent of portfolio value the modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that its assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day 
accordingly  management also monitors the risk in its trading activities by establishing position limits and daily review of trading results  inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
additional information is discussed under derivative financial instruments in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
as noted above  rjbank reviews interest rate risk based on net interest income and equity valuation 
one of the core objectives of rjbank s asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rjbank s interest rate risk including scenario analysis  interest repricing gap analysis and limits  and net portfolio value limits 
model based scenario analysis is used to monitor and report the interest rate risk positions  and analyze alternative strategies 
net interest income is the net amount of interest received less interest paid 
this involves large volumes of contracts and transactions  and numerous products 
simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates 
assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations  this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the right  but not the obligation  to repay before the scheduled maturity 
on the liability side  the re pricing characteristics of deposits are based on estimates since the rates are not coupled to a specified market rate 
the sensitivity of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated for a variety of scenarios 
assuming an immediate and lasting shift of basis points in the term structure of interest rates  rjbank s sensitivity analysis indicates that an upward movement would decrease rjbank s net interest income by in the first year after the rate jump  whereas a downward shift of the same magnitude would decrease rjbank s net interest income by 
these sensitivity figures are based on positions as of september   and are subject to certain simplifying assumptions  including that management takes no corrective action 
normally  a decline in rates would increase net interest income  but due to the historically low levels of interest rates in the united states  there is only limited opportunity to a djust rates downward on the liability side 
equity price risk the company is exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities and the investment activities of rja and rj ltd 
rja s activities are client driven  with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a trading profit to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory 
the company attempts to reduce the risk of loss inherent in its inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day and establishing position limits 
the company s canadian broker dealer has a proprietary trading business with traders 
the average aggregate inventory held for proprietary trading during the year ended september  was cdn  us 
the company s equity securities inventories are priced on a regular basis an d there are no material unrecorded gains or losses 
credit risk the company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include broker dealers  banks and other financial institutions 
in the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and or the issuer of the instrument 
the company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security and loan concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
the company s client activities involve the execution  settlement  and financing of various transactions on behalf of its clients 
client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
credit exposure associated with the company s private client group consists primarily of customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily and are collateralized 
when clients execute a purchase on margin the company is at some risk that the client will renege on the trade 
if this occurs  the company may have to liquidate the position at a loss 
however  for over three quarters of the private client group purchase transactions  clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed 
the company monitors exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and performs analysis on a regular basis i n connection with its margin lending activities 
the company adjusts its margin requirements if it believes its risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
in addition  rjbank offers a variety of loan products including mortgage  commercial real estate  and consumer loans  which are collateralized  and corporate loans for which the borrower is carefully evaluated and monitored 
rjbank s policy is to require customers to provide collateral prior to the disbursement of approved loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by rjbank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  residential real estate  and income producing commercial properties 
by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  rjbank exposes itself to credit risk with those counterparties also 
rjbank minimizes the credit or r epayment risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is investment grade 
the company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions  extends large loans to  or has large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreements to resell consist entirely of securities issued by the us government 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses 
the company seeks to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior ma nagement  taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the company  the size of the position or commitment  the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding 
the company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines continental and delta 
the company s ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines ability to fulfill its lease obligations 
in the event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the company is unable to re lease or sell the planes with adequate terms  the company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge related to a write down of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to delta airlines 
although delta has not defaulted on its obligations under this lease  delta s financial condition has continued to deteriorate  thus increasing the likelihood of such a default 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
the company operates different businesses in diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that the company s various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
a compliance and standards committee comprised of senior executives meets monthly to consider policy issues 
the committee reviews material customer complaints and litigation  as well as issues in operating departments  for the purpose of identifying issues that present risk exposure to customers or to the company 
the committee adopts policies to deal with these issues  which are then disseminated throughout the company 
the company has established a quality of markets committee that meets regularly to review execution of customer orders by the otc  option and listed trading departments 
this committee is comprised of representatives from the correspondent services  compliance and legal departments and is under the direction of a senior officer of rjf 
this committee reviews reports from otc  option and listed trading departments and recommends action for improvement when necessary 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of private client group customer claims  the possibility of sizable adverse legal judgments and non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
the company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly demanding over the past several years and the company  as well as others in the industry  has been directly affected by this increased regulatory scrutiny

the company has comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  extension of credit  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
the company acts as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings 
particularly when acting as lead or co lead manager  the company has legal exposure 
to manage this exposure  a committee o f senior executives reviews proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation 
the company s major business units have compliance departments that are responsible for regularly reviewing and revising compliance and supervisory procedures to conform to changes in applicable regulations 
the company experienced an increase in the number of private client group claims beginning in fiscal year as a result of the downturn in the equity markets  the number of claims has begun to decline but is still above historic levels 
while these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing  the company does  at a minimum  incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims
