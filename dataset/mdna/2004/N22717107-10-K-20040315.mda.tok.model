table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction core laboratories nv s core laboratories  we  our or us management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses matters we consider important in understanding the results of our operations and our capital resources and liquidity 
we begin our discussion with a general overview of our industry and how it relates to our business 
we then outline our critical accounting policies and estimates that have affected our consolidated financial statements 
we analyze the results of our operation for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operating segments  discuss our cash flows and liquidity and capital resources  list recent accounting pronouncements  and discuss inflation and income taxes 
we conclude md a with our outlook for our future results followed by forward looking cautionary statements 
general overview our clients expectations about their capital expenditure programs change in correlation to the prices of oil and natural gas 
accordingly  the changes in their capital expenditures which are focused on improving daily production from their reservoirs as well as over the entire life of those reservoirs will normally result in increased or decreased demand for our products and services 
commodity prices for both natural gas and crude oil rose throughout the spot price of crude oil was up just over while the price of natural gas increased over 
consequently  activity levels in the oilfield service sector increased during the year 
rig count improved in the us markets throughout the year  and  to a lesser extent  rig count improved outside the united states 
rig count oil and gas prices as of december  worldwide rig count us rig count crude oil price per barrel wti spot natural gas price spot average per mcf baker hughes incorporated world wide averages lehman brothers the original oil service monthly the price of natural gas increased during due to a variety of factors 
a major component of the increase in natural gas prices was decreased production of natural gas in as compared to the prior year 
the decline was due to lower production rates from maturing fields combined with steeper decline curves from newly discovered fields 
the pressure of falling supply coupled with increasing demand  due to an improving economy and a colder winter  contributed to an increase in the price of natural gas during the year 
oil prices also rose throughout the year reflecting similar factors that caused the price of natural gas to increase  primarily increasing demand  due to an improving economy  combined with a stable supply 
our activity levels increased in as our clients invested more of their cash flows back into developing and producing their reservoirs than they did in the prior year 
these higher activity levels led to record revenues being generated in the higher customer activity levels boosted revenues in our reservoir description segment by when compared to the prior year s revenues and by in our production enhancement segment 
given these higher revenues  in conjunction with efforts to contain our cost structure  we were able to generate operating income that was greater than the prior year 
our reservoir description segment showed improvement in all operations  primarily as a result of the spending levels of our clients aimed at characterizing and analyzing reservoirs  crude oil  and derivative products 
operating income from our production enhancement segment was up almost over the prior year as more wells in north america were drilled and stimulated than the prior year 
the greater the number of wells drilled or stimulated is important to this segment as it provides greater opportunity for our clients to use our products and services 
the operating results from our reservoir management group continued to be disappointing as the losses were greater than the prior year 
steps are being taken to refocus this segment that we believe will bring the segment back to profitable operating results 
these steps include downsizing the scope of or eliminating specialized geophysical and seismic related services  reducing employee costs  transferring work to the most efficient offices  or selling the specialized geophysical and seismic related services business to outside parties 
we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening strategic facilities and realizing synergies within our business lines 
also  as a result of the consolidation in the oil and gas industry  some of our clients have used  and may continue to use  their global presence and market influence to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates md a is based on financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us and require management to make estimates and assumptions during their preparation 
the application of the following critical accounting policies place significant emphasis on management s judgments regarding revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill  inventory valuation allowances  income taxes  stock options  and estimates 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized as services are completed or as product title is transferred 
all advance client payments are classified as unearned revenues until services are earned or product title is transferred 
we recognize revenue when we determine that the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from long term contracts are recorded as services are rendered in proportion to the work performed 
all known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for currently 
training and consulting service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
sales of perpetual software licenses  net of deferred maintenance fees  are recorded as revenue once the criteria of statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions are successfully met 
we primarily license our software products under perpetual licenses 
client support agreements are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period  generally one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and continuously monitor collections and payments in order to maintain a provision for estimated uncollectible accounts based on our historical collection experience and our current aging of client receivables outstanding in addition to client s representations and our understanding of the economic environment in which our clients operate 
based on our review we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable as a whole 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million compared to million at december  long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the respective asset s remaining useful life 
maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred 
when long lived assets are sold or retired  the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income 
property  plant and equipment held and used is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle use and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets 
we review our assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of property  plant and equipment may not be recovered over its remaining service life 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the sum of estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  is less than the asset s net book value 
impairment charges are recorded using discounted cash flows which requires the estimation of future cash flows  and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
there were no impairment charges related to long lived assets held for use recorded in  or 
table of contents in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two statements  statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations sfas  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  that amend accounting principles board apb opinion  business combinations  and supersede apb opinion  intangible assets 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and establishes the purchase method of accounting as the only acceptable method for all business combinations initiated after june  one of our acquisitions in was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting and was completed prior to the adoption of sfas goodwill resulting from a business combination or from an asset acquisition occurring after june  is to be recognized as an asset but not amortized  while goodwill existing at june  was amortized through december  as a result of adoption of sfas  beginning january   we no longer amortize goodwill but will test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the cessation of goodwill amortization under the guidelines resulted in a reduction in operating expenses of approximately million in and based on the amortization of the goodwill balance as of the effective date of sfas upon adoption of sfas  in the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of approximately million  primarily related to our reservoir management segment  which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
at december   we evaluated our goodwill and intangible assets and determined that the fair value had not decreased below their carrying value with no adjustment to goodwill and intangible assets necessary in accordance with sfas any subsequent impairment loss could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
inventory valuation allowances our valuation reserve for inventory is based on historical data  and various other assumptions and judgments including future demand for this inventory 
should these assumptions and judgments not come to fruition our valuation would change 
the industry we operate in is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  if we over or underestimate demand for inventory  it could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense includes income taxes of the netherlands  the us and other foreign countries as well as local  state and provincial income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled 
any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowances related to our net deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
stock options we apply apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  which does not require compensation costs to be recorded on stock options which have exercise prices at least equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  we have not recognized compensation cost for our stock options issued 
we have  however  included option shares in the diluted shares outstanding calculation that is used to determine diluted earnings per share 
we are not required to account for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value recognition provision of sfas accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
accounting for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas would negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
the fair value of stock options issued is estimated using pricing models that have an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the fasb has indicated that it expects to issue a standard during that will require the use of a fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we will evaluate the provisions of that standard when issued and would expect to include a charge to our results of operations in each future reporting period after the new standard is required to be implemented 
for a detailed discussion of our accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing 
table of contents basis and base these estimates on our historical experience as well as on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in a given circumstance 
by nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
critical estimates include key estimate nature of estimates required assumptions used allowance for doubtful accounts estimating allowance for doubtful accounts requires that we determine whether client receivables are collectible 
we base our estimate on historical collection experience and our current aging of client receivables outstanding in addition to clients representations and our understanding of the economic environment in which our clients operate 
inventory reserves estimating reserves for inventory requires forecasting client demand as well as taking into account changes in technological advances which may result in obsolescence 
we base our estimate on historical regional sales trends  as well as our expectations of future client requirements of types of products and technology 
depreciation and amortization estimating depreciation and amortization requires us to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
lives assigned reflect our best estimate based on historical data of the respective asset s useful life and salvage value 
if our operating plans change it could result in impairment of these assets 
income taxes we estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset in particular  net operating loss carryforwards 
we use historical and projected future operating results  including a review of the eligible carryforward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
if the laws of some tax jurisdictions in which we operate change it could significantly alter our estimates 
long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill we periodically review the recoverability of our assets  particularly when changes in circumstances suggest that the recorded cost may not be recoverable 
the measure of possible impairment is based primarily on the ability to recover the fair value of the related asset from expected future operating cash flows 
judgment is used when applying the goodwill impairment test since it requires the identification of reporting units  assigning goodwill to these units as well as determining the appropriate rate at which to discount these cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows using internal budgets based on historical information as well as client commitments and expected market trends 
the present value of such future cash flows is calculated by applying an estimated discount rate 
as such  our impairment analysis is subjective and includes estimates based on assumptions regarding future growth rates and operating expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements we hold investments in unconsolidated affiliates whose operations are in line with those of our core businesses 
our investment and operating percentages in these entities are included in our consolidated financial statements 
these entities are not considered special purpose entities nor do we have special off balance sheet arrangements through these entities 
they are not consolidated due to the limited influence we have in making management decisions

table of contents the discussion of operating results at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of operating results by segment 
margin analysis bar chart our revenues are derived from services and product sales 
services revenues in were million as compared to million in the increase in services revenues was due primarily to increased demand for our reservoir description and production enhancement services 
north american oilfield activity accounted for approximately of the increase while these services in the former soviet union  europe  africa and the middle east accounted for approximately of the increase 
we also saw increased activity in the asia pacific region due to a new contract in while activity in mexico was consistent with the overall increases more than offset decreased revenues as a result of the continued poor political climate in venezuela 
in  lower oilfield activity levels in north america caused our services revenues to decrease million as compared to costs of services in were million  an increase of million as compared to costs of services in were million  an increase of million from costs of services as a percentage of services revenues in remained consistent compared to we realized increased margins on reservoir rock and fluid analysis and our services relating to the characterization of properties of oil and gas products in north america and south america 
these increases were offset by margin erosion in several countries in the former soviet union due to increased competition as a result of maturing markets 
margins also decreased on our services for seismic technology as traditional seismic business continued to suffer 
operating costs and supplies increased due to purchases made in local currencies which strengthened against our functional currency 
in addition  in spite of our efforts to manage our business in venezuela  we were not able to sufficiently reduce the cost of services relative to the drastic decline in revenues attributable to the business disruptions experienced in that country 
sales revenues in increased by to million compared to million in and decreased by in as compared to the incremental revenue realized in was partially attributable to greater demand for our perforating products created by increased oilfield activity in north america in addition to the second quarter acquisition of the goex assets which accounted for approximately million in revenue 
a decline in drilling for natural gas and oil in the north american markets was the impetus for the reduction in sales revenues in from costs of sales in were million  an increase of million as compared to costs of sales in were million  a decrease of million from million in the overall fixed cost structure remained consistent from prior periods which resulted in higher margins on the incremental sales revenue 
a contributing factor to the decline in margins in was the currency devaluation in venezuela of million 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operating subsidiaries 
we experienced an increase of million in from and million in from in and  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were as compared to in the increased expenses in and were primarily attributable to increased expenses relating to our executive retirement plans  legal fees related to class action lawsuits and costs from the implementation of our company wide information system 
we have also incurred additional expenses relating to accounting services and our compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of which has necessitated engaging outside consultants to assist us with documenting and assessing the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million  an increase of million as compared to in we had an increase of million as compared to these increases were due primarily to the additional capital investments that occurred in both and 
table of contents as a result of the adoption of sfas beginning january   we no longer amortize goodwill but will test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
under these requirements  in the first quarter of we reflected impairment of goodwill of approximately million primarily related to our reservoir management segment 
this impairment is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cessation of goodwill amortization under the guidelines resulted in a reduction in operating expenses of approximately million in and based on the amortization of the goodwill balance as of the effective date of sfas during the fourth quarter of  we recorded write offs and other charges of million 
these charges were comprised of inventory write downs of million  charges of million to write fixed assets down to their fair value  and other costs of million to migrate data from legacy computer systems to a global information system database 
during the fourth quarter of  we also had several transactions that impacted certain operations that were not viewed as ongoing 
we restructured certain operations in mexico  the united kingdom  the us and other countries to improve operating efficiencies 
this restructuring expense included write offs of assets and leasehold improvements  and an accrual for facility restoration  severance benefits for approximately field employees and lease termination costs 
during we relocated a facility from mexico city to villahermosa  mexico 
we completed the relocation of one of our operations from dallas to the houston advanced technology center in early the remaining accruals will be utilized by may this charge of approximately million affected each of our operating segments as follows reservoir description million  production enhancement million  reservoir management million 
substantially all employee terminations were completed by the end of the first quarter of total cash required for this restructuring charge was million which will be funded from operating activities 
cash required for the costs incurred through december  was million 
this charge is summarized in the following table in thousands lease asset restructuring charges obligations severance restoration write offs other total total restructuring charges less costs incurred through december  accrual remaining at december  less costs incurred through december  accrual remaining at december  less costs incurred through december  accrual remaining at december  the fixed assets and leasehold improvements were disposed of by the end of december the write off approximates the carrying amount as these assets were abandoned or sold for salvage value 
depreciation expense was reduced by approximately in  in and thereafter 
the asset write offs of were attributable to the reservoir management segment 
the components of other income expense  net  are as follows in thousands year ended minority interest gain loss on sale of assets equity in earnings of affiliates foreign exchange gain loss interest income other total other income expense  net interest expense was million and million in and  respectively as compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to lower borrowing costs and lower average levels of debt 
the effective income tax rate decreased to of operating income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle from the rate of 
this decrease was primarily due to the non recurring nondeductible expenses that were incurred in as well as an increase in international earnings taxed at rates lower than the netherlands statutory rate 
the effective income tax rate increased to of operating income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle from the rate of 
this increase was the result of an increase in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes and an increased valuation allowance on venezuelan deferred tax assets

table of contents segment analysis our operations are managed primarily in three complementary business segments reservoir description  production enhancement and reservoir management 
revenues by segment pie chart revenues by segment pie chart revenues by segment pie chart segment revenues for the years ended december  dollars in thousands change change reservoir description production enhancement reservoir management total revenues segment operating income loss for the years ended december  dollars in thousands reservoir description production enhancement reservoir management corporate and other operating income corporate and other represents those items that are not directly related to a particular segment 
segment operating income loss margins for the years ended december  margin margin margin reservoir description production enhancement reservoir management margin is calculated by dividing operating income loss by revenue 
reservoir description reservoir description revenues for were million  an increase of million compared to the increased north american oilfield activity in led to greater demand for our reservoir rock analysis and our fluids analysis and characterization 
we saw increased activity in the former soviet union  europe and africa and new business in the asia pacific region 
in africa  
table of contents revenue gains were attributable to increased activity in nigeria in combination with revenue realized from the introduction of new technology 
in canada  we experienced revenue growth due to several large oil sand projects 
activity in mexico was consistent with the overall increases more than offset decreased revenues as a result of the poor political climate in venezuela 
revenues in increased million as compared to revenues of million 
this increase was mainly attributable to increased activity levels outside north america 
in addition  we experienced an increase in demand for our web based services and penetrated new markets in the former soviet union 
operating income in was million  an increase of million compared to we realized increased operating income in this segment primarily in north america  particularly in canada  and south america 
the overall increase in operating income in this segment was partially reduced by margin erosion in the former soviet union  europe and africa as a result of competitive pricing as the market for oil and gas services continued to develop 
operating income in decreased million as compared to reduced activity levels by our clients in north america were the primary factor for our lower earnings in other contributing factors to the decrease were political and economic instability in venezuela along with their currency devaluation 
production enhancement production enhancement revenues for were million compared to million in the largest contributions were increased oilfield activity in north america  our second quarter acquisition and integration of the assets of goex  and international contracts in mexico and canada 
revenues in decreased million compared to revenues of million 
due to lower industry activity levels in  we experienced decreased demand for our well completion and stimulation technologies  primarily in a depressed north american market 
operating income in was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
with a relatively fixed cost structure  we recognized higher incremental margins in compared to in  sales of lower margin services and the general decline in the north american markets impacted earnings in this segment 
in  in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiencies  we recorded expense in cost of sales of approximately million for several initiatives 
these initiatives were implemented in the fourth quarter whereby certain processes and business practices were evaluated and improvements were undertaken 
these costs were offset by income increases due to new initiatives with our downhole completion technologies and incremental margins on fracture diagnostic and field flood monitoring services as the introduction of new services and products in our production enhancement segment increased 
reservoir management reservoir management revenues for were million compared to million in revenues in decreased million as compared to revenues of million 
in  revenues decreased as we closed our uk operations 
we were also negatively impacted by the continuing soft market in geophysical processing 
the operating loss in was million compared to an operating loss of million and million in and  respectively 
the results included costs associated with the closure of the united kingdom operation and increased expenses related to the performance of existing services 
the positive results from our integrated multidisciplinary reservoir studies business  which realized operating income of approximately million in compared to a loss of million in were more than offset by the operating losses incurred by the geophysical and seismic related services 
in  we will endeavor to take the necessary steps to provide acceptable levels of returns for the reservoir management segment 
these steps include downsizing the scope of or eliminating specialized geophysical and seismic related services  reducing employee costs  transferring work to the most efficient offices  or selling the specialized geophysical and seismic related services business to outside parties 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million during primarily related to this segment to reflect our costs to restructure and refocus this segment of our business 
beginning in  certain facilities were downsized or closed  causing our workforce in this segment to be reduced by from the highest levels in we have taken and will continue to take actions  including  but not limited to  employee terminations and facility consolidations  when appropriate  to control our costs and generate additional service revenues in order to improve our results in this segment 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows year ended dollars in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities 
table of contents summary of cash flows year ended dollars in thousands financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents general cash flow from operating activities provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs  capital expenditures and the share repurchase program 
in addition  we supplement cash from operating activities with borrowings to provide funds to finance the share repurchase program  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our overall cash position reflects a global strategy to optimize cash management while considering funding needs 
we are a netherlands holding company and we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
consequently  our cash flow is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us 
cash from operating activities free cash flow bar chart we continue to generate increasing levels of operating cash flow 
in  million in cash was provided by operating activities compared with million and million in and  respectively 
in  our cash from operations was positively impacted by increased profitability and improved overall working capital management 
working capital improvements include our continuing efforts to manage inventory levels  an increase in accounts payable reflecting the appropriate aging of payments and favorable changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the timing of payments of accrued expenses 
favorable changes in prepaid expenses in were due in part to the financing of corporate insurance premiums of approximately million 
these cash provisions were partially offset by higher year end trade receivables resulting from record revenues in the fourth quarter of cash from operations in was impacted by significant non cash charges including a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of million for the impairment of goodwill related to our reservoir management segment 
in  cash from operations was principally a result of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital 
cash from investing activities free cash flow calculation year ended dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow our investing activities used million in as compared to using million in and million in investing activities in included the asset acquisition of goex for approximately million and capital expenditures of approximately million 
included in these capital expenditures were million relating to an upgrade of our company wide information system  and new facilities in godley  texas and amsterdam totaling million 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of million  which included a lab and office facility in russia for approximately million 
we also acquired certain assets from advanced data solutions which provides depth imaging and velocity modeling services for approximately million and received proceeds from the sale of assets of approximately million 
our investing activities for were attributable to capital expenditures of million and the acquisition of gris gun  which supplies wellbore perforating gun systems and other related completion products  for million in cash 
cash from financing activities in  our significant financing activities included repurchasing approximately  of our common shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we used million of our cash from operating activities along with million of additional indebtedness through our revolving credit facility to purchase these shares 
this share repurchase program was activated on october  in accordance with authority granted by our shareholders at our annual meeting in may the program authorized the purchase of up to of our outstanding shares through november  at our annual meeting held in may 
table of contents  this authority was extended through november  during  we repurchased approximately  shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million under our repurchase program 
our financing activities for included total borrowings of approximately million  while repayments were approximately million 
these net borrowings were used primarily to fund the asset acquisition of gris gun 
at our annual meeting held in may  shareholders approved the authorization to purchase of our outstanding shares through november  at a special meeting of shareholders held on october   shareholders approved the cancellation of  treasury shares with a total cost of approximately million and authorized the repurchase of up to of our issued share capital through april  subsequent to december   we have repurchased approximately  shares at a total cost of approximately million 
as of march  we had authority to repurchase approximately million additional shares 
the repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management 
we regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to finance future acquisitions 
however  we are incorporated in the netherlands and under the dutch commercial code dcc  a corporation can hold a maximum of of their outstanding shares in treasury 
therefore  it may be necessary to cancel some or all of these shares to remain in compliance with the dcc 
we believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders as we believe that  in conjunction with other actions taken by management  it has contributed to the increase in our share price from per share when the program was announced to per share on december   a gain of approximately 
this compares favorably to the s p index which gained approximately over the same time period 
credit facilities and available future liquidity in june  we amended the million credit facility which we entered into in july the june amendment reduced the capacity of the credit facility to million from million but added an option to increase the line of credit to million if certain conditions are met 
at december   million was available under our million credit facility 
in addition  we have senior notes  which bear interest at an average fixed interest rate of 
the senior notes require semi annual interest payments  while interest payments on the credit facility are made based on the interest period selected 
the terms of the credit facility and senior notes require us to meet certain financial and operational covenants 
we believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants at december  all of our material wholly owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co borrowers under both credit agreements 
we lease certain property  primarily land and buildings as well as office equipment and vehicles that are included in our analysis of operating leases 
the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations in thousands less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital leases operating leases total contractual obligations additionally  we have standby letters of credit as security for bids and performance on certain contracts of approximately million 
we do not believe these letters of credit will be drawn 
we expect our capital expenditure program to be approximately million in in addition  we plan to continue our repurchase of shares on the open market through our stock buy back program 
our share repurchase is dependent upon  among other things  market conditions as well as our ability to generate free cash flow 
our ability to maintain and increase our operating income and cash flows is dependent upon continued investing activities 
we believe our future cash flows from operating activities  supplemented by our borrowing capacity and issuances of additional equity should be sufficient to meet debt requirements  capital expenditures  working capital and future acquisitions

outlook we have established internal earnings targets that are based on current market conditions 
based on discussions with our clients and our view of the industry  we anticipate that in north american spending by our clients will increase slightly from we believe that the activity levels outside of north america will increase slightly compared to levels as we expand our international revenue base through direct product sales and technical services 
however  attaining our internal targets is dependent on sustained north american and international oilfield activity 
in venezuela  although operations have stabilized  our results could be negatively impacted by government mandated devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar vs 
the us dollar  as occurred on february  we expect to meet ongoing working capital  capital expenditure requirements and funding of our share repurchase program from a combination of cash on hand  cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
non gaap financial measures a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant s financial position  results of operations or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the balance sheet  statement of income or statement of cash flows  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 
from time to time  we utilize non gaap financial measures in the management and evaluation of our business 
the most common non gaap financial measures we use include free cash flow and debt to capitalization ratio 
free cash flow is calculated by starting with cash from operating activities and deducting capital expenditures 
management believes free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it represents the cash  in excess of capital expenditures  available to operate the business and fund non discretionary obligations 
debt to capitalization is calculated as follows debt divided by the sum of cash  debt and shareholders equity

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we have not entered  or intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that our exposure to market risks  which are primarily related to interest rate changes  is material 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our credit facility debt  which carries a variable interest rate 
at december   our variable rate debt outstanding of million approximated its fair value 
a one percent change in the interest rate would result in a change of approximately million in interest expense on an annual basis 
we attempt to balance the differing interest rate risks associated with fixed rate debt with variable rate debt 
foreign currency risk we operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not currently hold or issue forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
a foreign exchange contract is an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate 
foreign exchange gains and losses are the result of fluctuations in the us dollar against foreign currencies and are included in other income in the statements of operations 
we recognized foreign exchange losses in countries where the usd weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency and in countries where the usd strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency 
we recognized foreign exchange gains in countries where the usd strengthened against the local currency and we had net monetary liabilities denominated in the local currency and in countries where the usd weakened against the local currency and we had net monetary assets denominated in the local currency 
foreign exchange gains and losses are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended gains losses by currency canadian dollar euro mexican peso venezuelan bolivar other currencies total gains losses as a result of the recent political and financial situation in venezuela  in february  the venezuelan government mandated an exchange rate for their currency  the bolivar veb  of  veb per usd 
at december   our net monetary assets denominated in veb in venezuela were million 
effective february   the venezuelan government devalued the veb by to  veb per usd 
if this devaluation had occurred on december   the impact would have resulted in a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
because of this devaluation  in the first quarter of  we will incur foreign exchange losses on our net monetary assets denominated in veb 
a change of veb in the exchange rate could result in a change of approximately million in foreign exchange gain or loss subject to the amount of the net monetary assets at that time 
credit risk our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
all cash and cash equivalents are on deposit at commercial banks or investment firms 
our trade receivables are with a variety of domestic  international and national oil and gas companies 
we hold receivables from one customer totaling of total net receivables 
we have made further collections through march  from this client which  based on december  total net receivables  would have reduced this exposure to 
management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the creditworthiness and financial resources of these financial institutions and companies
