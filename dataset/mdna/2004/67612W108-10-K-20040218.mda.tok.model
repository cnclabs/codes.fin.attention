the acquisition has been accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests

fairfax financial holdings limited  a canadian financial services company  our majority stockholder  owns the controlling interest in fairfax asia 
through our operating subsidiaries  principally odyssey america  we are a leading united states based underwriter of reinsurance  providing a full range of property and casualty products on a worldwide basis 
we offer a broad range of both treaty and facultative reinsurance to property and casualty insurers and reinsurers 
treaty reinsurance involves the reinsurance of a specific line or class of business for an insurance company pursuant to an agreement or treaty 
facultative reinsurance involves the reinsurance of a specific policy as opposed to a line or class of business 
we also write specialty and non traditional lines of reinsurance  including professional liability  marine and aerospace 
odysseyre also underwrites specialty insurance business through newline and hudson 
effective january   we commenced  on a new and renewal basis  underwriting medical malpractice and hospital professional liability insurance through a healthcare unit located principally in napa  california 
during  we reinsured this business through a quota share agreement with an affiliate 
on october   we acquired an excess and surplus lines insurance company  hudson specialty  which  in  will serve as the main platform for the healthcare business 
the healthcare business is included in our us insurance division 
throughout and continuing into  we experienced growth opportunities in a number of areas  evidenced by our increase in gross premiums written of million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  improved pricing  industry consolidations and a series of catastrophic events  both in the united states and globally  have all contributed to our growth 
we have opportunistically expanded in certain classes of business and in each of our geographic business segments 
our non united states operations  including newline  accounted for of our premium volume for for the years ended december  and  our net premiums written were billion and billion  respectively  and our net income was million and million which included a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million for  respectively 
as of december   we had total assets of billion and total stockholders equity of billion 
the property and casualty reinsurance and insurance industries use the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability 
the gaap combined ratio is the sum of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned plus underwriting expenses  which include acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the combined ratio reflects only underwriting results  and does not include income from investments 
underwriting profitability is subject to significant fluctuations due to competition  catastrophic events  economic and social conditions  foreign currency fluctuations and other factors 
our combined ratio was for the year ended december   a decrease of percentage points from the combined ratio for the year ended december  this continued underwriting profitability is a direct result of our underwriting actions  including improvements 
table of contents in pricing as well as terms and conditions  and our opportunistic expansion into better performing lines of business 
we operate our business through four divisions  the americas  euroasia  london market  and us insurance  which are based principally on geographic regions 
the americas division is our largest division and writes casualty  surety and property treaty  and facultative casualty reinsurance in the united states and canada  and primarily treaty and facultative property reinsurance in central and south america 
the americas division is comprised of three units  the united states  canada  and latin america  with two offices in new york city  and offices located in stamford  mexico city  miami  santiago and toronto 
the euroasia division operates out of four offices  with principal offices in paris and singapore 
the euroasia business consists of international reinsurance business which is geographically dispersed  mainly throughout the european union  followed by japan  eastern europe  the pacific rim  and the middle east 
the euroasia division has been successful in taking advantage of the rate increases throughout its international scope of operations and in creating new market opportunities by leveraging its long term ceding company and broker relationships 
the business underwritten by first capital is also included in the euroasia division 
the london market division is comprised of our lloyd s of london business  in which we participate through our ownership of newline which in turn owns and manages syndicate  and our london branch office 
our lloyd s membership provides strong brand recognition  extensive broker and direct distribution channels and worldwide licensing  including the ability to write primary business on an excess and surplus lines basis in the united states 
the london market division in general  and newline in particular  has experienced a resurgence of opportunities from domestic and international business 
the london market division writes insurance and reinsurance business worldwide principally through brokers 
the us insurance division is comprised of specialty program insurance business underwritten by hudson and hudson specialty 
effective january   we commenced  on a new and renewal basis  underwriting medical malpractice and hospital professional liability business through the healthcare unit located principally in napa  california 
in  we reinsured this business through a quota share agreement with an affiliate  and will underwrite this business directly through hudson specialty in revenues we derive our revenues from two principal sources premiums from insurance and reinsurance assumed  net of premiums ceded net premiums written  and income from investments 
net premiums written are earned net premiums earned as they are credited to revenue over the terms of the underlying contracts or certificates inforce 
the relationship between net premiums written and net premiums earned will  therefore  vary depending generally on the volume and inception dates of the business assumed and ceded and the mix of such business between proportional and excess of loss reinsurance 
consistent with our significant accounting policies  we utilize estimates in establishing premiums written  the corresponding acquisition expenses and unearned premium reserves for our reinsurance business 
these estimates are required to reflect differences in the timing of the receipt of accounts from the ceding company and the actual due dates of the accounts at the close of each accounting period 
premium estimates  the corresponding acquisition expenses and unearned premium reserves are established on a contract level for any significant accounts due but not rendered by the ceding company at the end of each accounting period 
the estimated ultimate premium for the contract  actual accounts rendered by the ceding company  and our own experience on the contract are considered in establishing the estimate at the end of each accounting period 
the change in these estimates is reflected in the revenue account at the end of each accounting period 
these estimates are considered critical accounting estimates  because changes in these estimates can materially affect net income 

table of contents expenses we determine our reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on the evaluation of our in house claims department of the reports and individual case estimates received from ceding companies for reinsurance business or the estimates advised by our outside claims adjusters for insurance business 
we use generally accepted actuarial methodologies to determine a reserve for losses incurred but not reported ibnr on the basis of our historical experience and other estimates 
we review the reserves continually and changes in estimates are reflected in the operating results of the period in which they become known 
accordingly  losses and loss adjustment expenses are charged to income in the calendar year they are incurred 
upon receipt of a notice of claim from the ceding company  we establish our own case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate settlement  if any 
case reserves usually are based upon the amount of reserves recommended by the ceding company and may be supplemented by additional amounts as deemed necessary by our claims staff 
in certain instances  we establish case reserves even when the ceding company does not report any liability to the reinsurer 
we also establish reserves to provide for incurred but unreported claims and the estimated expenses of settling claims  including legal and other fees  and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process  known as loss adjustment expenses 
we calculate incurred but not reported loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques to project the ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we periodically revise such reserves to adjust for changes in the expected loss development pattern over time 
losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of related reinsurance recoverables  are charged to income as incurred 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses comprise the accumulation of case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves 
provisions for inflation and social inflation eg  awards by judges and juries which progressively increase in size at a rate exceeding that of general inflation are implicitly considered in the overall reserve setting process as an element of the numerous judgments which are made as to expected trends in average claim severity 
legislative changes may also affect our liabilities  and evaluation of the impact of such changes is made in the reserve setting process 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimates of amounts required to pay reported and unreported claims and related loss adjustment expenses 
we believe the estimate of these reserves is a critical accounting estimate because changes in these reserves can materially affect net income 
the estimates are based on assumptions related to the ultimate cost to settle these claims 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are determined in accordance with sound actuarial practices 
however  the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for reinsurers than for primary insurers  due to the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance contracts and the necessary reliance on ceding companies for information regarding reported claims 
as a result  we cannot be sure that our ultimate liability will not exceed amounts we have reserved 
as of december   our estimate of these liabilities net of reinsurance recoverables was  million  and as of december  was  million 
acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and brokerage expenses incurred on business written under reinsurance contracts or certificates and insurance policies 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
commission adjustments are accrued based on the underwriting profitability of the business produced 
deferred acquisition costs are limited to their estimated realizable value  which considers anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses and estimated remaining costs of servicing the contracts or certificates  all based on our historical experience 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the deferred costs are continually reviewed by the company  and any adjustments are made in the accounting period in which the adjustment arose 
we believe the estimate of these deferred acquisition costs is a critical accounting estimate  because changes in these estimates can materially effect net income 
other underwriting expenses consist of cost of operations associated with our underwriting activities 
these expenses include compensation  rent  and all other general expenses allocated to our underwriting activity and exclude any investment or claims related expenses

market sensitive instruments the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we believe that we are principally exposed to four types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk  equity price risk and foreign currency risk 
all market sensitive instruments discussed here relate to our investment assets which are classified as available for sale 
as of december   our billion investment portfolio is comprised of billion of fixed income securities that are subject primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 

table of contents interest rate risk the table below displays the potential impact of market value fluctuations on the fixed income securities portfolio as of december  and december   based on parallel basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in basis point increments 
this analysis was performed on each security individually 
as of december  as of december  fair value of fair value of fixed income hypothetical hypothetical fixed income hypothetical hypothetical percent change in interest rates portfolio change change portfolio change change dollars in millions basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline the preceding table indicates an asymmetric market value response to equivalent basis point shifts  up and down in interest rates 
this partly reflects exposure to fixed income securities containing a put feature 
in total these securities represent approximately and of the fair market value of the total fixed income portfolio as of december  and december   respectively 
the asymmetric market value response reflects our ability to put these bonds back to the issuer for early maturity in a rising interest rate environment thereby limiting market value loss but to hold these bonds to their much longer full maturity dates in a falling interest rate environment thereby maximizing the full benefit of higher market values in that environment

disclosure about limitations of interest rate sensitivity analysis computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and a change in individual issuer credit spreads 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december  and december   and  respectively  of our fixed income securities portfolio consisted of securities rated investment grade  with and  respectively  rated below investment grade 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on these fixed income investments to an acceptable level
