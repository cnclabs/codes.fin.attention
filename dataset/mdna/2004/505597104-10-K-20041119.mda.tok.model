the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
results of operations laclede group s earnings are primarily derived from the regulated activities of its largest subsidiary  laclede gas company laclede gas or the utility  missouri s largest natural gas distribution company 
laclede gas is regulated by the missouri public service commission mopsc or commission and serves the metropolitan st 
louis area and several other counties in eastern missouri 
laclede gas delivers natural gas to retail customers at rates  and in accordance with tariffs  authorized by the mopsc 
the utility s earnings are generated by the sale of heating energy  which historically has been heavily influenced by the weather 
however  as part of the rate case settlement  the utility initiated  effective november   an innovative weather mitigation rate design that lessens the impact of weather volatility on laclede gas customers during cold winters and is expected to stabilize the utility s earnings in the future by recovering fixed costs more evenly during the heating season 
due to the seasonal nature of the business of laclede gas  earnings are typically concentrated in the november through april period  which generally corresponds with the heating season 
the utility typically experiences losses during the non heating season 
the seasonal effect of the utility s earnings on laclede group is generally expected to be tempered somewhat by the results of sm p utility resources  inc sm p  a non regulated underground facility locating and marking service business wholly owned by laclede group  whose operations tend to be counter seasonal to those of laclede gas 
laclede energy resources  inc ler  a wholly owned subsidiary  is engaged in non regulated efforts to market natural gas and related activities 
other non regulated subsidiaries provide less than of consolidated revenues 
laclede group s strategy includes efforts to stabilize and improve performance of its core utility  while developing non regulated businesses and taking a measured approach in the pursuit of additional growth opportunities that complement the utility business 
as for the utility  mitigating the impact of weather fluctuations on laclede gas customers while improving the ability to recover its authorized distribution costs and return has been a fundamental component of the laclede group strategy 
the utility s distribution costs are the essential  primarily fixed expenditures it must incur to operate and maintain a more than  mile natural gas distribution system and related storage facilities 
in fiscal  when the weather mitigation rate design first went into effect  the weather was essentially normal  therefore  its impact was minimal 
however  it has shown its value during fiscal  as the downward pressure on revenues and earnings has been significantly mitigated despite temperatures that were warmer than normal 
the utility s income from off system sales remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
in addition  laclede gas is working to continually improve its ability to provide reliable natural gas service at a reasonable cost  while maintaining and building a secure and dependable infrastructure 
laclede group continues to develop its non regulated subsidiaries 
sm p is working toward expanding its geographic footprint into new markets  and has made notable gains in adding business in several key markets after experiencing setbacks in fiscal ler continues to focus on growing its markets on a long term and sustainable basis by providing both on system utility transportation customers and customers outside of laclede gas traditional service area with another choice in unregulated natural gas suppliers 
nevertheless  income from ler s operations is subject to fluctuations in market conditions

net income applicable to common stock laclede group s net income applicable to common stock for fiscal was million  compared with million for fiscal  and million for fiscal laclede group s basic and diluted earnings per share were for both the twelve months ended september  and september  earnings per share were unchanged from last year  as the effect of million higher net income in was essentially offset by the impact of higher average shares outstanding this year  largely due to the sale of million shares of common stock in may variations in net income were primarily attributable to the following factors  quantified on a pre tax basis 
utility earnings decreased by million in compared with primarily due to the following factors o income recorded in totaling million related to the utility s management of its annual gas supply costs  o the net effect totaling million of lower system gas sales volumes resulting from temperatures in laclede gas service area that were warmer than normal and warmer than the same period last year tempered by the beneficial effect this year of the fully implemented weather mitigation rate design that went into effect november   o a higher provision for uncollectible accounts totaling million above fiscal year  o an increase in interest charges of million  primarily due to the issuance of additional long term debt  o pension costs that increased million from fiscal year  and o higher wage rates 
these factors were partially offset by o non operating income recorded this year that increased million primarily reflecting the receipt of additional proceeds totaling million related to the utility s interest  as a policyholder  in the sale of a mutual insurance company  increases in other investment income  and lower donations  o a decrease in group insurance costs totaling million from fiscal year  o income from off system sales and capacity release that increased million from fiscal year  o the partial year effect of the implementation of an infrastructure system replacement surcharge effective june   totaling million  and o the fully implemented general rate increase  effective november   totaling 
million 
sm p reported income in fiscal totaling 
million compared with a loss of million in fiscal the significant improvement over the prior year was primarily due to the return of a substantial portion of business from two large customers as well as attainment of new business in both existing and new markets 
ler reported minor improvements in earnings results compared with fiscal year laclede group s basic and diluted earnings per share were for the twelve months ended september   compared with per share for the twelve month period ended september  the 
per share increase in earnings was primarily attributable to increased earnings reported by laclede gas 
the fiscal year increase in consolidated net income of million from fiscal year was primarily attributable to the following factors  quantified on a pre tax basis 
utility earnings increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the following factors o general rate increases effective december  and november  totaling million  o the net effect totaling million of higher system gas sales volumes in fiscal resulting from temperatures in laclede gas service area that were colder than normal and colder than the same period in fiscal  tempered by the partial year effect of the weather mitigation rate design effective november   o income from off system sales and capacity release that increased million from fiscal year  and o income recorded in totaling million related to the utility s management of its annual gas supply costs 
these factors were partially offset by o higher pension costs amounting to million  o the effect of income recorded in fiscal year produced by the utility s price stabilization program totaling million  o a higher provision for uncollectible accounts totaling million  o increased group insurance charges totaling million  and o higher wage rates 
results reported by sm p  a non regulated subsidiary acquired january   declined from fiscal year mainly due to the full fiscal year effect of seasonal losses  right sizing costs and the partial loss of revenue related to two customers  and additional start up costs related to sm p s expansion into new markets and the addition of new customers 
earnings reported by ler increased over fiscal year primarily due to higher volumes sold and increased margins achieved in a favorable market 
regulated operating revenues and operating expenses regulated operating revenues for fiscal year increased million  or  above fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to higher wholesale gas costs that are passed on to utility customers subject to prudence review by the mopsc totaling million  increased off system sales revenues totaling million  and  to a lesser extent  the effects of the general rate increase totaling 
million and the partial year effect of the isrs totaling million 
these factors were partially offset by lower system gas sales levels resulting from warmer weather and other variations totaling million 
temperatures were warmer than normal and warmer than last year 
regulated operating revenues for fiscal year increased million  or  above fiscal the increase in operating revenues was primarily comprised of higher natural gas sales levels resulting from colder weather and other variations amounting to million  higher wholesale gas costs that are passed on to utility customers subject to prudence review by the mopsc of million  increased off system and capacity release revenues of million  and the general rate increases effective december  and november  amounting to million 
laclede gas sold and transported billion therms in fiscal year compared with billion and billion in fiscal years and  respectively 
regulated operating expenses in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal natural and propane gas expense increased million  primarily attributable to higher rates charged by our suppliers and increased off system gas expense  partially offset by lower volumes purchased for sendout 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or  primarily due to a higher provision for uncollectible accounts  higher pension costs  and higher wage rates  partially offset by lower group insurance charges 
taxes  other than income  increased million  or  primarily due to higher gross receipts taxes attributable to the increased revenues 
regulated operating expenses in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal natural and propane gas expense increased million primarily attributable to higher volumes purchased for sendout arising from the colder weather  higher rates charged by our suppliers  and higher off system gas expense 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or  primarily due to increased pension expense  a higher provision for uncollectible accounts  increased group insurance charges  higher wage rates and increased insurance premiums 
these factors were partially offset by reduced distribution charges 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million primarily due to the effect of negative amortization of a portion of the depreciation reserve effective july   as authorized by the mopsc see note related to utility plant  depreciation and amortization 
this effect was partially offset by increased depreciable property 
taxes  other than income  increased million  or  primarily due to higher gross receipts taxes attributable to the increased revenues 
non regulated services operating revenues and operating expenses laclede group s non regulated services operating revenues for fiscal year increased million from those revenues for fiscal year primarily due to sm p s attainment of new business in both new and existing markets 
the reduction in non regulated services operating expenses  totaling million  was primarily attributable to sm p s reduction in personnel and related expenses and a non recurring million after tax charge recorded during fiscal year associated with the loss of business from two customers 
this reduction was partially offset by charges attributable to the employment related litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements on page of this report 
laclede group s non regulated services operating revenues for fiscal year increased million from those revenues for fiscal year  primarily attributable to the twelve month effect of revenues recorded by sm p in acquired january   partially offset by the partial loss of revenue related to two customers 
non regulated services operating expenses in fiscal year increased million due to the twelve month effect of operating expenses recorded by sm p compared with fiscal year  right sizing costs and the partial loss of business from two customers  and additional start up costs related to adding customers in new markets 
non regulated gas marketing operating revenues and operating expenses non regulated gas marketing revenues increased million from those revenues for fiscal year primarily due to higher volumes sold and increased sales prices by ler 
the increase in non regulated gas marketing operating expenses  totaling million  was primarily associated with increased gas expense incurred by ler related to higher volumes purchased and increased prices 
non regulated gas marketing revenues increased million from those revenues for fiscal year primarily due to increased gas marketing sales by ler 
non regulated gas marketing expenses increased million in fiscal year mainly due to higher expenses associated with increased sales levels 
non regulated other operating revenues and operating expenses non regulated other operating revenues decreased million in fiscal year from fiscal year  and increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year these variations were primarily due to changes in sales levels recorded by laclede pipeline company 
non regulated other operating expenses decreased million from fiscal year primarily due to lower expenses associated with decreased sales levels recorded by laclede pipeline company and increased million in fiscal year mainly due to higher expenses associated with increased sales levels recorded by laclede pipeline company 
other income and income deductions net the million increase in other income and income deductions net in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily attributable to the utility s recognition this year of the receipt of additional proceeds totaling million related to its interest  as a policyholder  in the sale of a mutual insurance company 
these proceeds represent initial distributions relating to certain policies held by the utility 
subsequent distributions  if any  are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
other income and income deductions net also increased due to higher investment income and lower donations 
the change in other income and income deductions net in fiscal year from fiscal year was minor because the receipt of proceeds related to the utility s interest in the sale of a mutual insurance company in totaling 
million was essentially offset by higher donations 
interest charges interest charges increased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to higher interest on long term debt due to the april issuance of million of first mortgage bonds  the april issuance of million of first mortgage bonds  and the full year effect of the issuance of long term debt to an unconsolidated affiliate trust in december totaling million 
these increases in interest costs were partially offset by the early redemption in june of million of first mortgage bonds and the may maturity of million of first mortgage bonds  as well as reduced interest on short term debt  mainly attributable to lower borrowings 
interest charges increased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the issuance of long term debt to an unconsolidated affiliate trust in december  partially offset by lower interest on long term debt due to the may maturity of million of first mortgage bonds and reduced short term interest expense primarily due to lower rates 
income taxes the increases in income taxes for all periods reported are primarily due to higher pre tax income 
labor agreement laclede gas had a labor agreement that expired july  with locals and of the paper  allied industrial  chemical energy workers international union  two locals that represent approximately of laclede gas employees 
on august   laclede gas and union representatives reached a new four year labor agreement replacing the prior agreement 
the new contract applies through july  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements allowances for doubtful accounts estimates of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable are based on historical trends  age of receivables  economic conditions  credit risk of specific customers  and other factors 
employee benefits and postretirement obligations pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions related to future events  such as discount rates  returns on plan assets  compensation increases  and mortality rates 
the amount of expense recognized by the utility is dependent on the regulatory treatment provided for such costs 
certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims  portions of which are self insured and or contain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit exposure  are established based on historical trends 
goodwill valuation in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that may reduce the value of goodwill 
in performing impairment tests  valuation techniques require the use of estimates with regard to discounted future cash flows of operations  involving judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results 
if the test indicates impairment has occurred  goodwill would be reduced adversely impacting earnings 
laclede gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement sets forth the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
the provisions of sfas no 
require  among other things  that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators  where appropriate 
these actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non regulated enterprises 
when this occurs  costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet regulatory assets and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates 
also  regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future regulatory liabilities 
management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of sfas no 
and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process 
we believe the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of sfas no 
the utility s purchased gas adjustment pga clause allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies  including the costs  cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas 
the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the pga are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period 
the company records deferred tax liabilities and assets measured by enacted tax rates for the net tax effect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
changes in enacted tax rates  if any  and certain property basis differences will be reflected by entries to regulatory asset or liability accounts for regulated companies  and will be reflected as income or loss for non regulated companies 
also  pursuant to the direction of the mopsc  laclede gas provision for income tax expense for financial reporting purposes reflects an open ended method of tax depreciation 
this method is consistent with the regulatory treatment prescribed by the mopsc to depreciate the utility s assets 
for further discussion of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k on page regulatory matters at the state level  there have been several important developments during the fiscal year affecting laclede gas  some of which are still pending 
laclede gas previously appealed the mopsc s decision in its rate case relative to the calculation of its depreciation rates 
the circuit court remanded the decision to the mopsc based on inadequate findings of fact 
the mopsc upheld its previous order and laclede gas appealed this second order to the circuit court 
in  the circuit court ruled that the mopsc s second order was lawful and reasonable  and laclede gas appealed the circuit court s decision to the missouri court of appeals for the western district 
on march  the court of appeals issued an opinion remanding the decision to the mopsc based on the mopsc s failure to support and explain its decision with adequate findings of fact 
in may  the court of appeals rejected the mopsc s request that the court reconsider its opinion or transfer this matter to the missouri supreme court 
on march   the mopsc staff and laclede gas responded to a mopsc order directing interested parties to submit new proposed findings of fact on this issue for its consideration 
by order dated may   the mopsc determined that it was necessary to take additional evidence on this issue 
evidentiary hearings were held on september   and briefs were filed on november  this proceeding now awaits the mopsc s decision 
laclede gas believes that a favorable decision  when recognized in rates  would be expected to benefit its cash flows 
on june   the staff of the mopsc filed its recommendation in a proceeding established to review laclede gas gas costs for fiscal in its recommendation  the staff proposed to disallow approximately million in pre tax gains achieved by laclede gas in its incentive based price stabilization program 
this program was discontinued at the end of the heating season 
laclede gas vigorously opposed the adjustment in proceedings before the mopsc  including a formal hearing that was held on this matter in february nevertheless  on april   the mopsc decided by a vote to disallow the million in pre tax gains achieved by laclede gas  and directed laclede gas to flow through such amount to its customers in its november pga filing 
on june   laclede gas appealed the mopsc s decision to the cole county circuit court 
on october   the circuit court issued an order staying the mopsc s decision requiring laclede gas to flow through the million to customers 
pursuant to the stay order  laclede gas is paying million into the court s registry pending a final judicial determination of laclede gas entitlement to such amounts 
on november   the circuit court of cole county  missouri  issued its order and judgment vacating and setting aside the commission s decision on the grounds that it was unlawful and not supported by competent and substantial evidence on the record 
on december   the mopsc appealed the circuit court s decision to the missouri court of appeals for the western district 
oral arguments were held in the missouri court of appeals for the western district on august  the utility is now awaiting the court s decision 
the utility continues to believe in the merits of its position and intends  if necessary  to assert its position vigorously throughout the appellate process 
however  to the extent that a final decision in the courts results in disallowance of the million in pre tax gains  it could have a material effect on the future financial position or results of operations of the company 
on march   laclede gas submitted to the mopsc an infrastructure system replacement surcharge isrs filing designed to increase revenues by approximately million annually 
such filing was made pursuant to a missouri law  enacted in  that allows gas utilities to adjust their rates up to twice a year to recover certain facility related expenditures that are made to comply with state and federal safety requirements or to relocate facilities in connection with public improvement projects 
on march   the mopsc suspended the proposed surcharge until june  pursuant to the statute 
on may  the utility and the staff of the mopsc filed a stipulation and agreement s a that provided for a million annual surcharge effective june  on june  the mopsc approved the s a 
on october   laclede gas submitted its second isrs filing to the mopsc designed to increase revenues by approximately an additional million annually 
accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  addresses consolidation of business enterprises of variable interest entities 
public entities shall apply this interpretation to their interests in special purpose entities as of the first interim period ending after december  application by public entities for all other types of variable interest entities was required in financial statements for periods ending after march  in december  laclede group formed a wholly owned trust  laclede capital trust i trust  for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and lending the gross proceeds to its parent  laclede group 
as of september   the trust had million of trust preferred securities outstanding 
the sole assets of the trust are debentures of laclede group  totaling million  with the same economic terms as the trust preferred securities 
prior to the application of fin r  the trust was consolidated in the financial statements of laclede group 
the company evaluated the effect of this pronouncement on this consolidation 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r  laclede group determined that the trust is a variable interest entity because its common securities investment is considered not at risk  and laclede group is not the primary beneficiary of the trust 
accordingly  the trust was deconsolidated during the quarter ended march  the consolidated balance sheets have been modified to include investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries of million representing laclede group s common securities investment in the trust and to reflect laclede group s obligations related to the debentures 
the common securities investment is included on the other property and investments line on the consolidated balance sheets 
as permitted under fin r  the trust has been deconsolidated for prior periods and presented to be consistent with the current presentation 
the adoption of fin r did not result in a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment and did not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of laclede group

the act introduces two new features to medicare that an employer needs to consider in measuring its obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
the effective date for fsp is the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the adoption of fsp did not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
inflation the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions  regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business of laclede gas  the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant 
rate regulation  to which laclede gas is subject  allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation 
while no plans exist to undertake replacements of plant in service other than normal replacements and those under existing replacement programs  laclede gas believes that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities would be recovered through the normal regulatory process 
credit ratings as of september   credit ratings for outstanding securities for laclede group and laclede gas issues were as follows type of facility s p moody s fitch laclede group corporate rating a laclede gas first mortgage bonds a a a laclede gas commercial paper a p trust preferred securities a baa bbb the company has investment grade ratings  and believes that it will have adequate access to the financial markets to meet its capital requirements 
these ratings remain subject to review and change by the rating agencies 
cash flows the company s short term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when laclede gas borrows money to cover the gap between when it purchases its natural gas and when its customers pay for that gas 
changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas  variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the utility s pga clause  the seasonality of accounts receivable balances  and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short term cash requirements to vary during the year  and can cause significant variations in the utility s cash provided by or used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended was million  a million increase  compared with fiscal year the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to changes in the cost of natural gas in storage and variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the pga clause 
net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended was million  compared with cash provided by operations in fiscal year totaling million 
the adverse effect on cash related to operating activities was primarily due to changes in the cost of natural gas in storage and unfavorable variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the pga clause 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million compared with million for fiscal year cash used in investing activities during both periods primarily reflected utility construction expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million primarily reflecting utility construction expenditures and the acquisition of sm p 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year  primarily reflecting the repayment of short term debt and the payment of dividends  partially offset by the issuance of additional long term debt and common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year  reflecting the issuance of long term debt to unconsolidated affiliate trust and additional short term borrowings  partially offset by the may maturity of million of first mortgage bonds and the payment of dividends 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million primarily due to additional short term borrowings partially offset by the payment of dividends 
liquidity and capital resources the company s short term borrowing requirements have traditionally been met through the sale of commercial paper supported by lines of credit with banks 
during the fiscal year heating season  laclede gas had lines of credit in place of up to million  including a million seasonal line during the peak winter season 
laclede gas had short term borrowings aggregating to a maximum of million at any one time during the fiscal year 
these borrowings were primarily commercial paper  supplemented from time to time by draws on the seasonal line of credit or short term loans from laclede group 
loans from laclede group were no more than million at any time 
at the date of this report  laclede gas has aggregate lines of credit totaling million  with million expiring in april and million expiring in september short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  were million at a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
based on short term borrowings at september   a change in interest rates of basis points would increase or decrease pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis 
most of laclede gas lines of credit include covenants limiting total debt  including short term debt  to no more than of total capitalization and requiring earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to be at least times interest expense 
on september   total debt was of total capitalization 
for the fiscal year ended september   ebitda was times interest expense 
laclede gas has on file a shelf registration on form s of the million of securities originally registered under this form s  million of debt securities remained registered and unissued as of september  the original mopsc authorization for issuing securities registered on this form s expired in september in response to an application filed by the utility  the mopsc extended this authorization to issue debt securities and receive paid in capital through october  the remaining mopsc authorization is million  reflecting capital contributions that have been made by laclede group to laclede gas under this authority through october the amount  timing and type of additional financing to be issued under this shelf registration will depend on cash requirements and market conditions 
in april  laclede gas issued million of first mortgage bonds  series  due may   and million of first mortgage bonds  series  due may  the net proceeds of approximately million from this issuance were used to repay short term debt and to call at par the million series first mortgage bonds in june the proceeds were also used to pay at maturity million of first mortgage bonds in november at september   laclede gas had fixed rate long term debt totaling million  including the million current portion 
while these long term debt issues are fixed rate  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
however  increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if laclede gas were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity 
laclede group has on file a shelf registration on form s  which allows for the issuance of equity securities  other than preferred stock  and debt securities 
of the million of securities originally registered under this form s  million remain registered and unissued as of september  laclede group issued million shares of common stock in may under this registration 
the net proceeds of approximately million from this sale were used to make a capital contribution to laclede gas 
laclede gas used the contribution to reduce short term borrowings and for general corporate purposes 
the amount  timing and type of additional financing to be issued under this shelf registration will depend on cash requirements and market conditions 
short term cash requirements outside of laclede gas have generally been met with internally generated funds 
however  laclede group has a million working capital line of credit obtained from us bank national association  expiring in june  to meet short term liquidity needs of its subsidiaries 
this line of credit has a covenant limiting the total debt of laclede gas company to no more that of the utility s total capitalization as noted above  this ratio stood at on september  
this line has been used to provide letters of credit of million on behalf of sm p  which have not been drawn  and to provide for seasonal funding needs of the various subsidiaries from time to time 
the maximum balance outstanding during fiscal year was million  and there was no balance outstanding as of september  sm p has several operating leases  the aggregate annual cost of which is approximately million  consisting primarily of month operating leases  with renewal options  for vehicles used in its business 
upon acquisition of sm p  laclede group assumed parental guarantees of certain of those vehicle leases 
laclede group anticipates that the maximum guarantees related to existing leases will not exceed million 
no amounts have been recorded for these guarantees in the financial statements 
laclede group had guarantees outstanding totaling million for performance and payment of certain wholesale gas supply purchases by ler as of september  laclede group issued an additional million guarantee in october on behalf of ler 
utility construction expenditures were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal laclede gas expects fiscal utility construction expenditures to approximate million
