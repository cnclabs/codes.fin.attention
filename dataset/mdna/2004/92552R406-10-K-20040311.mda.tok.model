item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with viad corp s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
viad corp s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed under forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
overview viad corp viad operates in two reportable business segments as follows payment services through travelers express company  inc and related subsidiaries travelers express  revenues are primarily derived from transaction fees and investment and related income by providing various services related to money transfers  money orders  official checks  and urgent and routine bill payment 
fee revenues are driven by transaction volume and contract pricing through a network of agents and customers  including financial institutions 
investment and related income is generated by investing funds received from the sale of payment instruments until such instruments are settled 
convention and event services through ges exposition services  inc ges  revenues are generated by providing various convention and tradeshow services such as freight handling  logistics  electrical  installation  dismantling and management services to trade associations  show management companies and exhibitors 
exhibitgroup giltspur exhibitgroup specializes in the design  construction  refurbishment  installation and warehousing of convention and tradeshow exhibits  primarily for corporate customers 
viad also operates certain travel and recreation businesses  brewster transport company limited and glacier park  inc these businesses provide tour and charter operations for tourism in the canadian rockies and operate historic lodges and food services in certain national parks in north america 
in and continuing in  viad faced market challenges and difficult economic conditions 
the payment services segment experienced increased transaction volume and higher investment balances  however  operating income growth was slowed due to significantly lower interest rates and unprecedented mortgage refinancing activity 
the unprecedented mortgage refinancing activity resulted in higher average float balances as greater numbers of official checks were issued 
at the same time  the mortgage backed securities held in the payment services investment portfolio experienced accelerated prepayments 
consequently  these funds were invested or reinvested at lower interest rates compared to furthermore  the payment services segment recorded significant other than temporary impairment losses and adjustments on certain investments 
the convention and event services segment produced profitable results despite decreased demand for new exhibit construction and tradeshow shrinkage 
overall  viad improved its financial strength and reduced its total debt obligations 
see results of operations and liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
the following financial highlights are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap viad corp consolidated total revenues of billion  a decrease of net income of million  an increase of diluted income per share of  an increase of debt decreased by million year over year payment services revenues of million  an increase of segment operating income of million  a decrease of convention and event services revenues of million  a decrease of segment operating income of million  an increase of 
table of contents other significant items in january  the payment services segment completed the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in moneygram international limited mil for approximately million in cash and a dividend of million paid by mil to travelex group plc 
mil provides international sales and marketing services in connection with the money transfer business primarily in europe  africa  asia and australia 
in march  the payment services segment completed the sale of game financial corporation to a subsidiary of certegy inc for approximately million in cash 
game financial corporation provides cash access services to casinos and gaming establishments throughout the united states 
as a result of the sale  viad corp expects to record an after tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of and may record future after tax gains of million  based on contingencies in the contract 
spin off transaction on july   viad announced a plan to separate its payment services segment from its other businesses by means of a tax free spin off 
to effect the separation  travelers express will become a subsidiary of moneygram international  inc moneygram  a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of viad  and viad will distribute all of the shares of moneygram common stock as a dividend on viad common stock 
at the time of the spin off  the businesses of moneygram will consist solely of the payment services business 
the continuing business of viad  which is being referred to as new viad  will consist of the businesses of the convention show services  exhibit design and construction  and travel and recreation services operations  including viad s centralized corporate functions located in phoenix  arizona 
the spin off and related transactions are subject to a number of conditions including the receipt and continued applicability of a ruling from the internal revenue service that the spin off will qualify as a tax free transaction  confirmation that the long term debt of moneygram will have an investment grade rating  availability of satisfactory banking and credit arrangements for moneygram and new viad and final approval of the board of directors of viad 
on december   moneygram filed a preliminary registration statement on form with the securities and exchange commission relating to the registration of moneygram international  inc common stock to be issued in the proposed spin off 
on february   viad announced that it had received a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service confirming that the proposed spin off will qualify as tax free to viad and its stockholders 
management expects that the spin off will occur during the second quarter of there can be no assurance that the spin off transaction will be completed 
in connection with the completion of the spin off  viad will repay its commercial paper of approximately million  tender for its senior notes of million and subordinated debt of million  retire its industrial revenue bonds of million  and redeem its outstanding preferred stock at an aggregate call price of approximately million 
moneygram intends to negotiate and enter into bank credit facilities providing availability of up to million  in the form of a revolving credit facility and or term loan 
of the total million  moneygram expects to borrow million prior to the time of the spin off  the proceeds of which will be paid to viad and used by viad to repay all or a portion of its outstanding commercial paper or similar indebtedness 
the remaining amount of the credit facilities is expected to be available to moneygram for general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
management expects that the term of such facilities will be for periods of up to four years and that the facilities will contain customary terms and conditions 
however  any such term loan and revolving credit facilities would not become effective until immediately prior to the spin off and there can be no assurance that moneygram will be able to enter into credit facilities on terms acceptable to moneygram 
additionally  new viad intends to negotiate and enter into bank credit facilities for general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit providing availability of at least million  of which new viad expects to borrow approximately million at the time of the spin off  the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes 
management expects that the term of such facilities will be for a period of up to three years and that the facilities will contain customary terms and conditions 
however  any such revolving credit facility would not become effective until immediately after the spin off and there can be no assurance that new viad will be able to enter into credit facilities on terms acceptable to new viad 
consummation of the spin off is conditioned upon moneygram and new viad entering into satisfactory credit arrangements 
notwithstanding the legal form of the spin off  due to the relative significance of moneygram to viad  moneygram will be considered the divesting entity and treated as the accounting successor to viad for financial reporting purposes in

 accounting for reverse spinoffs 
the spin off of new viad will be accounted for pursuant to accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
accordingly  the spin off will be accounted for based upon the recorded amounts of the net assets to be divested 
moneygram will charge directly to equity as a dividend the historical cost carrying amount of the net assets of new viad 
furthermore  if the spin off transaction were to occur  moneygram would report the historical results of operations subject to certain adjustments of new viad in discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 such presentation is not allowed until the date of the spin off 
non gaap measures the following discussion includes a presentation of adjusted ebitda  which is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  changes in accounting principles and discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
adjusted ebitda is also used by management to assess viad s ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and finance growth 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
this non gaap measure should be considered in addition to  but not a substitute for  other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations because it is useful for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda primarily as a performance measure and believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to federal and state income taxes and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
because adjusted ebitda does not consider these items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income an important measure of viad s financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of viad s performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization changes in accounting principles income from discontinued operations net income the increase in adjusted ebitda in of million was primarily due to lower restructuring charges and higher restructuring recoveries for a net change of million in as compared to  which was partially offset by lower operating income of approximately million 
the increase in adjusted ebitda from to was largely due to decreased restructuring charges and other items year over year of million 
included below is a presentation of float income which is defined by viad as payment services investment income before taking into account investment gains and losses and impairment charges 
impairment charges only include other than temporary impairment losses related to certain structured notes  asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
interest income adjustments related to private equity obligations are excluded from the presentation below 
as such  total impairment charges presented elsewhere in this annual report may differ from this presentation reflecting the effects of the interest income adjustments related to private equity obligations 
also presented below is net float income which is defined by viad as float income less commission expense 
float income and net float income are non gaap 
table of contents measures used by management to analyze the effects that factors such as interest rates and average investment balances have on overall investment portfolio performance 
management believes that the presentation of float income and net float income is a useful measure for investors to consider when evaluating the portfolio management effectiveness with respect to the payment services segment 
reconciliations of float income to payment services investment income and to net float income are as follows in thousands float income net realized gains and losses impairment charges payment services investment income in thousands float income commission expense net float income see results of operations payment services below for a discussion of float income and net float income 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which include the accounts of viad and all of its subsidiaries 
all per share figures discussed are stated on the diluted basis 
results of operations vs 
revenues for decreased percent to billion from billion in the decline was primarily driven by lower sales in the convention and event services segment due to negative show rotation and weaker demand for the design and construction of new exhibits 
the decrease was partially offset by increased revenues in the payment services segment resulting from growth in money transfer transaction volume 
income from continuing operations before income taxes was million for compared to million for the increase was primarily due to the restructuring charge recorded in  the restructuring reversal in  lower net interest expense in as compared to and lower corporate activities and minority interest expense in these favorable results aggregating approximately million were offset by lower operating income of million  which was largely the result of lower net interest margin on the float portfolio  reflecting the lower interest rate environment  as well as other than temporary impairment charges and interest income adjustments in the payment services segment 
net income for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for net income included the reversal of certain discontinued operations reserves of million million after tax during payment services 
revenues of the payment services segment were million for  a percent increase from comparable revenues of million 
the payment services segment operating income was million  an percent decrease from segment operating income of million 
operating margins were percent in compared to percent in the payment services segment operating income and margin declines were driven by the lower interest rate environment on the payment services investment portfolio float portfolio and by other than temporary impairment charges and interest income adjustments of million in compared to million in the payment services segment evaluates investments with an investment grade rating of a and below for impairment under eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
when an adverse change in estimated cash flows occurs and the fair value of a security is less than its carrying value  the investment is written down to fair value 
these charges related primarily to structured notes held in the portfolio  and to a lesser extent  certain asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the structured investments consist of an investment grade security  generally a us treasury strip security combined with an investment in 
table of contents the residual interest in a collateralized debt obligation  or in some cases  a limited partnership interest 
future adverse cash flow changes related to the investments subject to eitf issue no 
could result in additional impairment charges 
the charges above were partially offset by net realized gains of million and million in and  respectively 
additionally  the payment services segment recorded a curtailment gain of million related to the freezing of the defined benefit pension plan 
the money transfer business continued to show strong results with total transaction volume growing percent  led by strong international transaction volume and urgent bill payment volume 
internationally originated transactions grew by over percent and domestically originated transactions  including the urgent bill product  grew by percent 
the money order business continues to contribute significantly to operating margin and cash flows 
however  money order volume was down percent compared to due to the loss of certain agents  partially offset by strong growth in sales at wal mart 
although primelink official check outsourcing services was not a strong driver of revenue and operating income due to lower interest rates and impairment charges  it continued to show growth in balances and new signings 
total average investable funds for were billion  up percent from levels  primarily driven by the primelink official check outsourcing business  which had an increase of average investable balances of over percent 
payment services investment income represented approximately percent of the total payment services revenue in compared with percent in float income is affected by the level of investment balances and the yield on investments 
float income excluding gains  losses and impairments and expense associated with the payment services segment s investment portfolio for the years ended december were as follows average income yield average income yield balance expense rate balance expense rate in thousands investments substantially restricted for payment service obligations payment service obligations net float income and margin the payment services segment is regulated by various state agencies  which generally require the payment services segment to maintain liquid assets and investments with an investment rating of a or higher  in an amount generally equal to the payment service obligation for regulated payment instruments such as teller and agent checks  money orders and money transfers 
in addition  the payment services segment has contractual arrangements that generally require maintenance of liquid assets and investments in an amount equal to the payment instruments  namely cashiers checks 
due to these regulations  a substantial amount of funds  agent receivables and investments are not available to satisfy working capital or other financing requirements of the payment services segment 
the amount of funds  agent receivables and investments that are restricted  either for regulatory or contractual purposes  is equal to the total amount of payment service obligations  and  at december  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
commissions are paid to financial institution customers based upon average outstanding balances generated by the sale of primelink products only 
the expense reported includes those payments made to financial institution customers  costs associated with swaps and the sale of receivables program 
the average balance in the table reflects only the payment service obligations for which commissions are paid and does not include the average balance of the sold receivables million and million for and  respectively as these are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
commission expense is classified in costs of services in the consolidated statements of income 
yield rate percentages are calculated by dividing the applicable amount shown in the income expense column by the applicable amount shown in the average balance column 
float income was million in compared to million in  a decrease of percent 
the float income decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates which drove float income down by million  reflecting an average investment yield of percent  or a basis point decline from percent in during the same period  the fed funds rate declined by basis points and the year us treasury note declined by basis points 

table of contents the lower interest rates earned on the portfolio in compared to was primarily due to the unprecedented mortgage refinance activity 
the payment services segment typically maintains between million and million in short term  liquid balances to fulfill its payment service obligations 
the average balance for was million compared to million for unprecedented mortgage refinancing activity drove an increase in the sale of official checks resulting in higher average float balances 
these higher balances were invested at lower rates compared to in addition  refinancing activity drove a significant increase in the prepayments of mortgage backed debt securities held in the portfolio  resulting in the reinvestment of these funds at lower interest rates 
the decline in float income due to lower rates was partially offset by an increase in float income of million resulting from higher average float balances 
the payment services segment had billion or percent and billion or percent of its total float portfolio invested in mortgage backed securities as of december  and  respectively 
commission expense was million in  a decrease of million  or percent from  primarily driven by lower interest rates 
the commission expense decrease attributable to lower interest rates was million reflecting an average commission rate of percent for  or a basis point decline from percent in the decline in commission expense was due to lower interest rates and was partially offset by higher average balances resulting in higher expense of million 
commission expense includes amounts paid to financial institution customers based upon average outstanding balances generated by the sale of primelink products  net payments made to counterparties of swap agreements  and the discount on the sale of receivables 
commissions paid to customers generally are variable based on short term interest rates  however  a substantial portion of the commission expense has been fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  viad has an agreement to sell  on a periodic basis  undivided percentage ownership interests in certain receivables primarily from its money order agents 
these receivables are sold to commercial paper conduits sponsored by a financial institution 
the receivables are sold to accelerate the payment services segment s cash flow for investment in permissible securities and are sold at a discount based upon short term interest rates 
the discount is included in commission expense 
net float income float income less commission expense was million in  down million  or percent  from primarily due to lower interest rates 
the decrease in net float income attributable to a decline in float interest rates was million  and was partially offset by increased float income of million due to balance growth 
net float margin was percent  reflecting a basis point decline from percent in as mentioned above  refinancing activities led to an increase in the sale of official checks and  therefore  an increase in float balances 
however  a substantial portion of these balances were invested at short term interest rates equal to or less than the interest rates paid out in commissions to financial institution customers  thus reducing net float margin 
although commissions and the discount on the sale of receivables program benefited from lower short term interest rates  the fixed rate swap agreements mitigated a portion of the benefit of reduced interest rates 
operating income and margins were negatively impacted as the pay fixed interest rate swaps used to fix the cost of variable rate commissions paid to official check banks matured at a slower rate than investments in mortgage backed securities that prepaid more rapidly than expected 
also contributing to the margin decline was a change in product mix reflecting higher overall growth in the primelink business  which has lower net float margins than the balances generated by the money order business 
if interest rates remain low and refinancing activity continues to be strong  revenue and operating income growth could continue to be constrained 
the impact of changes in average investable balances and interest rates on the float income and commission expense associated with the investment portfolio for the years ended december was as follows vs 
yield balance rate total in thousands float income commission expense net float income the balance column is calculated by annualizing the result of the yield rate for the prior year s period multiplied by the change in the investments substantially restricted for payment service obligations 
the yield rate column is calculated by annualizing the result of the investments substantially restricted for payment service obligations for the prior year s period multiplied by the change in the yield rate 
see non gaap measures for further explanation of float income and net float income 
net float income for the balance and yield rate columns is not the net of float income and commission expense as each of these amounts is calculated independently 

table of contents one of the payment services segment objectives in managing the float portfolio is to mitigate the risk to earnings created by changing interest rates 
to mitigate that risk  interest rate derivatives are entered into that effectively limit exposure to the floating rate commission payments to financial institution customers 
these derivatives effectively convert the variable interest rate to a fixed rate 
the fair value of viad s derivative positions fluctuate with interest rate changes 
these fluctuations in the fair value of viad s derivatives are reflected as increases or decreases to a component of stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the available for sale investment portfolio are also reflected as increases or decreases to a component of stockholders equity 
the change in the fair value of the derivative liability for resulted in a net increase of million in stockholders equity  and the net change in the fair value of the available for sale investment portfolio resulted in a net increase of million in stockholders equity 
included in the change related to the available for sale portfolio is a million increase related to the reclassification of billion in investments from held to maturity to available for sale in the first quarter changes in the value of the available for sale investment portfolio will generally move in the opposite direction of the derivative values  although they will rarely offset exactly 
convention and event services 
revenues of the convention and event services segment were million in  a decrease of percent from the revenues of million 
segment operating income was million in compared to million in  up percent 
segment operating margins were percent and percent in and  respectively 
the convention show services business experienced an percent decrease in revenues  however  operating income increased during the year 
revenues were million in compared to million in the decline in revenues largely resulted from net negative show rotation  where shows rotating out of  such as the international manufacturing technology show  outweighed the shows rotating into  such as the national plastics expositions and worldwide food show 
the sequential year over year declines in tradeshow attendance  the number of exhibiting companies and convention square footage resulting from weak overall economic conditions since have led to lower demand for services  cancelled shows and tradeshow shrinkage which contributed to the revenue decline 
furthermore  political instability in the middle east and threats of terrorism continue to impact travel  which adversely affects the convention and events industry 
the improvement in operating income reflects increased operating efficiency and cost containment 
management continues to emphasize cost containment initiatives in response to the current economic environment and uncertainty regarding near term revenue growth 
within the convention and event services segment  the exhibit design and construction business experienced a percent decrease in revenues during the year 
exhibit design and construction revenues were million in compared to million in the decline in revenues was driven by weak demand for the design and construction of new exhibits  primarily due to diminished corporate spending and continued softness in the general economy  as many exhibitors elected to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than placing orders for new construction 
visibility in this industry continues to be poor 
if the weak demand for the design and construction of new exhibits continues  revenues could decline further and operating income could be similarly affected 
operating income during was down slightly primarily due to the revenue decline which was partially offset by the effectiveness of management initiatives to improve performance  including restructuring efforts 
in the fourth quarter  as a result of decreased visibility over revenues and continued uncertainties regarding improvements in the tradeshow industry  viad approved a restructuring plan resulting in a restructuring charge of million million after tax 
of the total restructuring charge  million was included in the consolidated statements of income under the caption restructuring charges recoveries and million as costs of services 
the components of the million charge consisted of employee severance and benefits of million  facility closure and lease termination costs of million net of estimated sublease income  asset impairments related to fixed assets and inventories of million and other charges of  in the fourth quarter  restructuring recoveries totaling million were recorded resulting from changes in estimates of net future cash outflows  mainly related to favorable sublease income at restructured facilities 
as of december   a remaining liability of million related to the restructuring is included in the consolidated balance sheets 
travel and recreation services 
revenues of the travel and recreation businesses decreased million  or percent  to million in operating income for the travel and recreation businesses was million  a decrease of percent from million in operating margins for and were percent and percent  respectively 
these businesses were negatively impacted by a continued decline in the world travel market due to ongoing threats of terrorism  the war in iraq  health issues sars  mad cow disease and west nile virus  air canada s financial difficulties and wildfires in and around glacier national park  montana 
since the events of september   worldwide leisure travel has been on a steady decline  directly affecting the travel and recreation businesses with reduced visitation during and again in in  these businesses were also 
table of contents severely affected by the announcement in april that air canada  which serves a large portion of visitors to these businesses  was experiencing financial difficulty and had filed for protection under canada s companies creditors arrangement act 
this event reduced the capacity of transportation available for visitors to western canada 
visitor travel from asia  long a key market for these businesses  was significantly lower in  primarily due to the outbreak of sars in asia in late a subsequent sars outbreak in canada reduced the number of travelers coming to canada from the united states and europe 
lastly  during the peak summer season of  wildfires in and around glacier national park forced the closure and evacuation of many of viad s hotels and attractions 
despite the fact that the fires were under control in late summer  significant reservation cancellations left the businesses operating far below capacity 
given glacier national park s limited visitation season  the lost business could not be recouped elsewhere 
the impact of the above reductions in revenue in from also impacted operating income 
while certain of the costs of these businesses can be pared down for certain fluctuations in visitor attendance  many of the unforeseen events of left these businesses with excess costs relative to revenue 
the forest fires  in particular  forced these businesses to maintain overhead costs to ensure sufficient resources were available to facilitate the closures and subsequent re openings  and to service the visitors 
thus  while revenues were down percent  expenses could not be shed as rapidly  resulting in an operating income decline that far exceeded the revenue decline 
corporate activities 
corporate activities expense decreased million from to this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in certain administrative expenses in as compared to in addition  included a curtailment gain of million related to the freezing of viad s defined benefit pension plan 
other investment income 
investment income decreased million due primarily to decreased corporate investments which were primarily used to repay million of medium term notes and to fund the mil minority interest acquisition 
this resulted in lower average investment levels which  combined with lower average interest rates  drove the decline 
additionally  investment income included million of interest income associated with a federal income tax refund for the through tax years 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in as a result of the debt repayment and lower average interest rates throughout the year and the reversal of million of previously accrued interest due to favorable income tax settlements 
from to  viad s average outstanding debt balances decreased by approximately million while the weighted average interest rate declined by approximately basis points 
minority interests 
the decrease in minority interest expense of million in from was due to the payment services segment s acquisition of the remaining percent interest in mil 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was percent in compared to a percent tax rate in the relatively low effective rate compared to the statutory federal rate of percent was primarily attributable to tax exempt income from the payment services segment 
the increase in the effective tax rate year over year was due to a lower proportion of tax exempt income to pre tax income in compared to the higher rate for resulted from the shift in the mix of investments from nontaxable to taxable investments 
even though nontaxable investments generally have higher after tax yields than taxable investments  viad has shifted its mix of nontaxable and taxable investments to balance its alternative minimum tax position 
vs 
during  the convention and event services segment continued to experience a reduction in the number and size of tradeshows and further declines in the demand for the design and construction of new exhibits 
this decline was due to diminished corporate spending and the continued downturn in the general economy as many exhibitors elected to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than place new orders 
as a result of decreased visibility over future revenues and continued uncertainties regarding improvements in the tradeshow industry  the convention and event services segment revised its forecasted demand and re evaluated its manufacturing capacity requirements and cost structure during the fourth quarter of accordingly  viad recorded a fourth quarter restructuring charge totaling million million after tax of which million relating to consulting fees incurred and the write down of certain inventories was charged to costs of services in the consolidated statements of income 
the remaining million was classified under restructuring charges recoveries in the consolidated statements of income 
the restructuring relates to the closure and consolidation of certain facilities  severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately positions across numerous regions  business functions and job classes 
the charge also includes amounts for the disposal net of estimated proceeds of certain inventories and fixed assets  facility closure and lease termination costs net of estimated sublease income and other exit 
table of contents costs 
viad had substantially completed the restructuring activities at december   however  payments due under long term lease obligations will continue to be made over the remaining terms of the lease agreements 
severance and benefits payments will be made over the varying terms of the individual separation agreements 
during  a restructuring charge of million million after tax was recorded primarily related to the convention and event services segment for which the related restructuring activities had been completed by the end of as of december   a remaining liability of million related to the restructuring is included in the consolidated balance sheets 
in  viad adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets no longer be amortized  but  instead  be tested for impairment 
concurrent with the adoption of sfas no 
 viad performed the transitional impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
viad determined that no impairment existed for other intangible assets  but a transitional impairment loss of million million after tax was recorded related to goodwill at the exhibitgroup giltspur reporting unit of the convention and event services segment 
see critical accounting policies for additional discussion related to goodwill impairment testing 
revenues for were billion  down slightly from the revenues of billion 
the payment services segment revenue increased by million over the prior year  while the convention and event services segment revenue decreased by million over the prior year 
viad also had a slight decline in its travel and recreation services businesses 
net income for was million  or per share  as compared with the amount of million  or per share million  or per share when adjusted for sfas no 

there were  additional average outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares in than in this was largely driven by significant stock option exercise activity during the first half of  partially offset by the resumption of the stock repurchase program described in liquidity and capital resources 
payment services 
revenues of the payment services segment were million in  a percent increase over revenues of million in segment operating income was million  a percent increase over operating income of million in or down million from million when adjusted for sfas no 

operating margins of percent in were down slightly compared to percent in or down from percent when adjusting for the impact of sfas no 

the increase in the payment services segment operating income was driven by continued growth in the money transfer business 
the payment services segment experienced double digit growth in the number of locations that sell or provide both money orders and money transfer services  including  us wal mart locations 
the money transfer business continued to show strong results with transaction volume growing percent from to  led by strong international money transfer and urgent bill payment volume 
the agent base of the money transfer business expanded by percent over growth in the us to mexico corridor was down slightly over  however the money transfer fixed price product  cambio plus  continued to grow in the high teens on a percentage basis 
these results were reduced by the other than temporary impairment losses and interest income adjustments of million in as compared to similar losses and adjustments of million in which excludes a million  or million after tax  adjustment for a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of eitf issue no 

the money order business continued to contribute significantly to operating margin and cash flows  however  money order volume and related average investable balances were down slightly compared to as some agents were eliminated and fewer agents were approved in order to manage the credit quality of the money order business 
average investable funds for were billion  up percent from levels primarily driven by the official check business

the payment services segment maintains approximately million to million in short term  highly liquid balances in order to fulfill its payment service obligations 
lower yields were earned on these short term balances during due to interest rate declines 
in addition  the dramatic decline in interest rates resulted in unprecedented and volatile mortgage refinancing activity during refinancing activities caused an increase in the sale of official checks and an increase in float balances 
the refinancing activity also drove a significant increase in the prepayments of mortgage backed debt securities  resulting in the investment of these funds at lower interest rates

commission expense includes amounts paid to financial institution customers based upon their average outstanding balances generated by the sale of primelink products  net payments made in connection with swap agreements  and the discount on the sale of certain agent receivables 
commissions paid to customers are generally variable based on short term interest rates  however  a substantial portion of the commission expense has been fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  viad has an agreement to sell  on a periodic basis  undivided percentage ownership interests in certain receivables primarily from its money order agents 
these receivables are sold to commercial paper conduits sponsored by a financial 
table of contents institution 
the receivables are sold to accelerate the company s cash flow for investment in permissible securities and are sold at a discount based upon short term interest rates 
net float income float income less commission expense was million in  up million or percent from  primarily due to increased balances 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in interest rates  reflecting a net float margin of percent  or a basis point decline from percent in the margin decline was a result of a lower interest rate environment as short term and float balances earned lower yields and proceeds from prepayments and sales were reinvested at lower yields 
as mentioned above  refinancing activities caused an increase in the sale of official checks and therefore an increase in float balances 
however  a substantial portion of these balances were invested at short term interest rates equal to or less than the interest rates paid out in commissions to financial institution customers  thus reducing net float margin 
although commissions and the discount on the sale of receivables program benefited from lower short term interest rates  the fixed rate derivatives used to mitigate the effects of fluctuations on these expenses have contractual maturities  and therefore  did not benefit from reduced interest rates 
also contributing to the margin decline was a change in product mix reflecting higher overall growth in the official check business  which has lower net float margins relative to the money order business 
the impact of changes in average investable balances and interest rates on the float income and commission expense associated with the investment portfolio for the years ended december was as follows vs yield balance rate total in thousands float income commission expense net float income the balance column is calculated by annualizing the result of the yield rate for the prior year s period multiplied by the change in the investments substantially restricted for payment services obligations 
the yield rate column is calculated by annualizing the result of the investments substantially restricted for payment service obligations for the prior year s period multiplied by the change in the yield rate 
see non gaap measures for further explanation of float income and net float income 
the totals for the balance and rate columns are not the sum of the individual lines as income and expense changes are calculated independently 
the payment services segment uses interest rate derivatives to mitigate its exposure to the floating rate commission payments to financial institution customers 
the fair value of these derivatives can fluctuate with interest rate changes  and are reflected as increases or decreases to a component of stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the available for sale investment portfolio are also reflected as increases or decreases to a component of stockholders equity 
the change in the fair value of the derivative liability for was a net decrease of million in stockholders equity  while the net change in the fair value of the available for sale investment portfolio was a net increase of million in stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the available for sale investment portfolio will generally move in the opposite direction of the derivative values although they will rarely offset 
the main objective in entering into the derivatives is to first mitigate the risk on earnings due to the change in interest rates and secondarily to mitigate the risk to equity 
convention and event services 
revenues of the convention and event services segment were million in  a decrease of percent from the revenues of million in segment operating income was million in compared to million in or million when adjusted for sfas no 

segment operating margins were percent and percent in and  respectively 
when adjusting for the impact of sfas no 
 the operating margin would have been percent 
within the convention and event services segment  the convention show services business experienced a percent decrease in revenues  however  operating income increased during the year 
revenues were million in compared to million in the decline in revenues largely reflects lower demand for services and tradeshow shrinkage due to overall weak economic conditions 
since  and throughout  the tradeshow industry experienced sequential declines in tradeshow attendance  the number of exhibiting companies  and convention square footage 
tradeshow activity also reflects industry specific conditions 
show shrinkage was significant in the technology and telecommunications sectors  while health related shows had slightly improved and other service industries had stabilized 
during  several shows were canceled  scaled back or lost to competitors 
however  these declines were partially offset by new business in such as the comdex and international manufacturing technology shows  and positive show rotation related to the conexpo conag 
table of contents and international woodworking shows  as these events do not occur every year 
operating income improvements during primarily reflect improved margins and lower costs as the benefit of a previous restructuring had largely been realized 
the exhibit design and construction business experienced a percent decrease in revenues during the year 
exhibit design and construction revenues were million in compared to million in revenues were negatively impacted by declines in the demand for the design and construction of new exhibits 
this decline was due to diminished corporate spending and the downturn in the general economy as many exhibitors elected to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than placing new orders 
operating income performance was poor during primarily due to the decline in revenues  excess manufacturing capacity  and certain inefficiencies 
as discussed above  due to decreased visibility over revenues and continued uncertainties regarding improvements in the tradeshow industry  the convention and event services segment recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax 
the restructuring plan was primarily focused on cost reductions through centralizing manufacturing capacity from five locations to three and centralizing certain support functions 
viad substantially completed the restructuring activities during  however  payments due under the long term lease obligations will continue to be made over the remaining terms of the lease agreements 
severance and benefits payments will be made over the varying terms of the individual separation agreements 
see critical accounting policies for additional discussion of the accounting method related to the restructuring 
during  a restructuring charge of million million after tax was recorded related to the convention and event services segment for which the related restructuring activities were completed by the end of travel and recreation services 
revenues of the travel and recreation businesses decreased million  or percent  to million in operating income for the travel and recreation businesses was million  a decrease of percent from that of operating margins for and were percent and percent  respectively 
when adjusting for the impact of sfas no 
 operating income would have been million with a decrease of percent and the operating margin would have been percent 
the revenue decrease resulted primarily from a continued decline in the world travel market 
corporate activities 
corporate activities expense increased million from to this increase was due largely to million for legal  investment banking  and other costs incurred in connection with a contemplated initial public offering of travelers express 
additional increases related to higher insurance premiums and employee benefit costs in other investment income 
investment income increased million in due primarily to million of interest income received associated with a federal income tax refund for the through tax years and an increase in investment income associated with corporate investments due to higher average investment levels during  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in as a result of steadily declining average outstanding debt balances and average interest rates throughout the year 
approximately percent and percent of the average debt outstanding during and  respectively  were related to short term borrowings that were subject to variable interest rates 
minority interests 
the increase in minority interest expense of million in from relates to strong growth in the payment services segment s percent interest in mil 
in january  viad purchased the remaining percent interest in mil 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was percent  up from an percent tax benefit in predominantly due to the restructuring charges and other items recorded in excluding the effect of the and restructuring charges and other items  the effective tax rate was percent  up from percent in when adjusted for the impact of sfas no 
the effective tax rate in would have been percent 
the relatively low rate compared to the statutory federal rate is primarily attributable to tax exempt income from viad s payment services segment 
the higher rate for is due to lower tax exempt investment income in proportion to total pre tax income resulting from the shift in the mix of investments from nontaxable to taxable investments 
liquidity and capital resources cash and corporate investments were million at december  as compared to million at december   with the decrease primarily due to the repayment of million related to certain medium term senior notes that matured and a capital contribution to travelers express to acquire the minority interest share of mil described below  partially offset by cash generated from operations 
corporate investments are included in the balance sheet caption other investments in securities

prior to the acquisition  moneygram payment systems  inc owned a percent interest in mil 
in connection with the transaction  moneygram payment systems  inc paid approximately million to travelex 
in addition  mil paid a dividend to travelex of approximately million concurrent with the transaction 
viad s total debt at december  was million compared with million at december  the debt to capital ratio at december  was to  compared to to at december  capital is defined by viad as total debt excluding preferred stock plus minority interests and common stock and other equity 
in connection with the completion of the spin off  viad will repay its commercial paper of approximately million  tender for its senior notes of million and subordinated debt of million  retire its industrial revenue bonds of million  and redeem its outstanding preferred stock at an aggregate call price of approximately million 
moneygram intends to negotiate and enter into bank credit facilities providing availability of up to million  in the form of a revolving credit facility and or term loan 
of the total million  management expects to borrow million prior to the time of the spin off  the proceeds of which will be paid to viad and used by viad to repay all or a portion of its outstanding commercial paper or similar indebtedness 
the remaining amount of the credit facilities is expected to be available for general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
moneygram expects that the term of the bank credit facilities will be for periods of up to four years and that the facilities will contain customary terms and conditions 
however  any such term loan and revolving credit facilities would not become effective until immediately prior to the spin off 
immediately subsequent to the spin off and related transactions  moneygram is expected to have approximately million of total debt outstanding representing the borrowing described above 
there can be no assurance that moneygram will be able to enter into credit facilities on terms acceptable to moneygram 
additionally  new viad intends to negotiate and enter into bank credit facilities providing availability of at least million for general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit  of which new viad expects to borrow approximately million at the time of the spin off  the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes 
management expects that the term of the bank credit facilities will be for a period of up to three years and that the facilities will contain customary terms and conditions 
however  any such revolving credit facility would not become effective until immediately after the spin off 
immediately subsequent to the spin off and related transactions  new viad is expected to have approximately million of total debt outstanding representing the million borrowing described above and approximately million of previously existing debt assigned to new viad pursuant to the spin off agreements 
there can be no assurance that new viad will be able to negotiate credit facilities on terms acceptable to new viad 
completion of the spin off is conditional upon moneygram and new viad entering into satisfactory credit arrangements 
under a shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission  viad can issue up to an aggregate million of debt and equity securities 
in  viad filed an amended shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission to update disclosures in the registration statement and to maintain viad s financial flexibility 
no securities have been issued under the program 
viad authorized a stock repurchase program in for the purpose of replacing viad common shares issued upon exercise of stock options and in connection with other stock compensation plans  with the intended effect of reducing dilution caused by the issuance of these shares of viad common stock 
this program was on hold for most of and the first six months of while cash was conserved given the uncertainty in the economy 
in the third quarter of  viad resumed the repurchase program and acquired million shares for million at an average price of per share 
in the second quarter of  viad acquired  shares for  at a price of per share 
prior to the break in the stock repurchase program  million shares of viad common stock were repurchased in early for million at an average price of per share 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options  including tax benefits on stock option exercises  totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the level of future cash generated from stock option exercises may vary depending on viad s stock price compared to the option exercise price and the ability of the grantees to exercise stock options 
with respect to working capital  in order to minimize the effects of borrowing costs on earnings  viad strives to maintain current assets at the lowest practicable levels while at the same time taking advantage of payment terms offered by trade creditors and obtaining advance deposits from customers for certain projects and services 
however  working capital 
table of contents requirements may fluctuate from seasonal factors and changes in levels of receivables and inventories caused by numerous business factors 
viad has credit facilities totaling million to support general corporate purposes  various letters of credit and a canadian credit facility 
the million includes a million five year facility and a million day facility 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facilities is indexed to the london interbank offering rate  plus appropriate spreads 
the facilities also provide for commitment fees 
such spreads and fees would change should viad s debt ratings change 
for example  a change from viad s current bbb baa debt rating to a non investment grade rating  would result in an increase of up to basis points in the interest rate applicable to the credit facilities 
to date  viad has not drawn against these facilities  however  if and or when a drawing were to occur  the repayment schedule would be determined at that time 
these facilities have been primarily used to backstop viad s outstanding commercial paper borrowings and support outstanding letters of credit 
the committed lenders pursuant to these two credit facilities include twenty one major financial institutions with citigroup as the lead administrative agent and arranger 
on august   viad s day short term revolving credit facility was amended 
the total amount of the lenders commitments was increased from million to million under similar terms and the commitment termination date of each eligible lender was extended to august  in addition  a provision was added which requires the absence of material adverse change as a condition of converting any outstanding borrowings to a term loan 
short term borrowings totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  have been classified as long term debt  pursuant to the unused commitments under the applicable long term and short term credit facilities 
unused commitments net of amounts used to support short term borrowings and letters of credit under the facilities totaled million at december  borrowings under the facilities are subject to various covenants  including a minimum net worth covenant  and a total debt to ebitda financial ratio covenant 
if viad were to default on any other debt obligation outstanding of at least million in aggregate  it would constitute an event of default with respect to the credit facilities under applicable cross default provisions 
as of december   viad was in compliance with all of its covenants 
upon completion of the spin off transaction  these credit facilities will automatically terminate and be replaced with the separate credit facilities described above related to moneygram and new viad 
the ability of viad to maintain its investment grade rating is important because it affects the cost of borrowing 
in addition  certain financial institution customers of the payment services segment require that viad maintain an investment grade rating 
any ratings downgrade could increase viad s cost of borrowing  result in termination of debt or require certain actions to be performed to rectify such a situation 
a downgrade could also have a negative effect on viad s ability to attract and retain new or existing customers 
as a result of the announcement on july  of viad s intention to spin off moneygram  the rating agencies put viad on credit watch with negative implications as it is probable that the existing debt of viad would not be rated investment grade following the separation of moneygram 
viad has announced that it will tender for all public debt  pay off all commercial paper and redeem its preferred stock concurrent with the spin off 
because the commercial paper market is ratings driven  regardless of the reason for the credit watch  this action may result in increased borrowing costs for viad in the future 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million in these expenditures primarily related to certain leasehold improvements  information systems and related costs  and manufacturing and other equipment 
capital spending has been reduced by obtaining  where appropriate  equipment and other property under operating leases 
cash flows from operations during the past three years have generally been sufficient to fund capital expenditures  acquire businesses and pay cash dividends to stockholders 
although no assurance can be given  viad expects operating cash flows and short term borrowings to be sufficient to finance its ongoing business  maintain adequate capital levels  and meet covenant and investment grade rating requirements 
should financing requirements exceed such sources of funds  viad believes it has adequate external financing sources available  including unused commitments under its credit facilities  to cover any shortfall 
viad had unused commitments net of amounts used to support short term borrowings and letters of credit under its existing credit facilities of million as of december  
table of contents the following table presents viad s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases derivative financial instruments other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations other long term obligations consist of funding commitments of the payment services segment related to collateralized private equity obligations 
as of december   viad s aggregate noncancelable purchase obligations were not significant  and were therefore excluded from the above table 
in december  ges began occupying and commenced lease payments on a newly constructed facility in las vegas  nevada 
the leased property provides ges with approximately  square feet of combined warehouse  manufacturing and office space 
the lease was accounted for as an operating lease  and as such  is not included on viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the original lease term is years and the aggregate base rental payments over the lease term are approximately million 
at december   approximately million of the remaining aggregate base rental payments remain and are included under the caption operating leases above 
as of december   viad had certain guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries 
the fair value of these guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
these parent subsidiary guarantees primarily relate to leased facilities included in operating leases in the table above and credit or loan arrangements with banks  entered into by viad s subsidiary operations 
viad would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing at december  would be million 
at december   the aggregate guarantees related to leased facilities were million  and expire through january at december   the aggregate guarantees related to credit or loan arrangements with banks were million of which million is subject to an ongoing guarantee by a viad subsidiary commensurate with the subsidiary s credit facility  and has no expiration date 
there are no recourse provisions that would enable viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees 
furthermore  there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby viad could recover payments 
the payment services segment subsidiaries generate funds from the sale of official checks  money orders and other payment instruments  with the related liabilities classified as payment service obligations 
substantially all of the proceeds of these sales are invested in permissible securities  principally high quality debt instruments 
these investments are restricted by the payment services segment to the extent that they represent proceeds from the sale of its payment instruments for use by the subsidiaries to satisfy the liability to pay  upon presentment  the face amount of such payment service obligations 
accordingly  these assets are not generally available to satisfy working capital or other financing requirements of viad 
the securities are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption  investments substantially restricted for payment service obligations 
certain additional assets of the payment services segment subsidiaries relating to payment service obligations  including cash  funds in transit from agents and securities expected to be sold or maturing within one year  are included under the caption  funds  agent receivables and current maturities of investments substantially restricted for payment service obligations 
although the payment services segment investment portfolio exposes viad to certain credit risks  viad believes the high quality of the investments reduces this risk 
approximately percent of the investments at december  and approximately percent of the investments at december  have an investment grade rating of a or higher or are collateralized by federal agency securities 
although payment services investment portfolio is highly diversified  if any one issuer were unable to pay its obligations or were to enter into bankruptcy  the payment services segment may have to sell the investment and reinvest the proceeds in permissible securities and or could lose a portion or a substantial amount of the investment with such issuer 
in addition  deterioration in the debt and or equity markets could lead to further other than temporary impairment losses related to the 
table of contents payment services segment s investment securities in future periods 
see critical accounting policies for discussion regarding estimates and assumptions related to other than temporary declines in the value of securities 
under normal circumstances there is no requirement to sell long term debt securities prior to their maturity  as the funds from ongoing sales of money orders and other payment instruments and funds from maturing long term and short term investments are expected to be adequate to settle payment service obligations as they are presented 
fluctuations in the balances of payment services assets and obligations result from varying levels of sales of money orders and other payment instruments  the timing of agent receivables  and the timing of the presentment of such instruments 
the payment services segment has agreements with clearing banks that provide processing and clearing functions for money orders and official checks 
one clearing bank contract has covenants for the payment services segment that include  maintenance of a minimum level of capital of million  maintenance of total assets restricted for payment services obligations at least equal to total outstanding payment service obligations  maintenance of a minimum ratio of total assets held at that bank to instruments clearing through that bank of percent and a cumulative net income requirement of million for every two quarter period 
while the payment services segment is in compliance with these covenants  maintenance of the covenants may require additional capital contributions to be made by viad to the payment services segment and or may require the payment services segment to change the mix of its investments or increase the level of investment liquidity  which could result in lower rates of return 
working in cooperation with certain financial institutions  the payment services segment has established separate consolidated entities special purpose entities and processes that provide these financial institutions with additional assurance of the ability to clear their official checks 
these processes include maintenance of specified ratios of segregated investments to outstanding payment instruments 
this ratio is typically to in some cases  alternative credit support has been purchased by payment services that provides backstop funding as additional security for payment of their instruments 
however  payment services remains liable to satisfy the obligations  both contractually as evidenced in the agreements with the financial institutions  as well as by operation of the uniform commercial code  as issuer and drawer of the official checks 
accordingly  the obligations have been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets under payment service obligations 
under certain limited circumstances  clients have rights to demand liquidation of the segregated assets or to take other similar actions 
such limited circumstances consist of material and in most cases continued failure of the payment services segment to uphold its warranties and obligations pursuant to its underlying agreements with the financial institution clients 
while an orderly liquidation of assets would be required  any of these actions by a client could nonetheless diminish the value of the total investment portfolio  decrease earnings  and result in loss of the client or other customers or prospects 
the special purpose entity is offered by the payment services segment to certain financial institution clients as a benefit unique in the payment services industry 
the payment services segment has an agreement to sell  on a periodic basis  undivided percentage ownership interests in certain receivables  primarily from its money order agents  in an amount not to exceed million 
these receivables are sold to two commercial paper conduits sponsored by a financial institution and represent a small percentage of the total assets in each of these two conduits 
viad s rights and obligations are limited to the receivables transferred  and are accounted for as sales transactions under sfas no

the agreement expires in june see off balance sheet arrangements below 
as of december   viad s payment services segment subsidiaries have various lines of credit  overdraft facilities and reverse repurchase agreements totaling billion available to assist in the management of their investments and the clearing of payment service obligations 
as of december   million was outstanding under an overdraft facility 
no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december  the payment services segment has agreements with certain investors to provide funds related to investments in collateralized private equity obligations 
as of december   the total amount of unfunded commitments related to these agreements was million 
viad sold treasury stock in to its employee equity trust the trust to fund certain existing employee compensation and benefit plans over the scheduled year term of the trust 
for financial reporting purposes  the trust is consolidated with viad 
the fair market value of the shares held by the trust  representing unearned employee benefits  is recorded as a deduction from common stock and other equity and is reduced as employee benefits are funded 
as of december    shares remained in the trust and were available to fund future benefit obligations 
viad has certain funded  noncontributory pension plans that cover certain employees 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations

viad is subject to various environmental laws and regulations of the united states as well as of the states and other countries in whose jurisdictions viad has or had operations  and is subject to certain international agreements 
as is the case with many companies  viad faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters 
although viad is a party to certain environmental disputes  viad believes that any liabilities resulting from these disputes  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  exclusive of any potential insurance recovery  have been properly reserved for  however  environmental settlements could result in future cash outlays 
off balance sheet arrangements viad has certain arrangements or transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and could materially affect liquidity or require the use of capital resources 
as of december   these arrangements and transactions include aggregate operating lease commitments of million  aggregate guarantees of million representing parent guarantees of subsidiary obligations and funding commitments related to collateralized private equity obligations of million

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of viad s reporting units 
the fair value of viad s reporting units is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 
during  viad recorded a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million million after tax related to the exhibitgroup giltspur reporting unit of the convention and event services segment 
subsequent to the initial adoption of sfas no 
 annual impairment tests were performed in and resulting in no additional impairment 
however  a decline in the expected cash flows or the estimated terminal value in the future could lead to additional goodwill impairment losses 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate weighted average cost of capital could also result in additional goodwill impairment 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property loss and medical claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with the sales of businesses 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s prior historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels 
the self insured retention levels generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad s 
table of contents total cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were approximately million and million for the years end december  and  respectively 
pension obligations viad has trusteed  noncontributory pension plans that cover certain employees 
pension benefits are supplemented  in most cases  by defined matching company stock contributions to employees k plans 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for pension benefits for employees of certain sold businesses 
through december   the principal retirement plan was structured using a traditional defined benefit formula based primarily on final average pay and years of service 
benefits earned under this formula ceased accruing at december   with no change to retirement benefits earned through that date 
effective january   benefits began accruing under a cash accumulation account formula based upon a percentage of pay plus interest 
effective january   benefits under the cash accumulation formula ceased accruing new benefits for service periods subsequent to december  with no change in benefits earned through that date 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
certain defined pension benefits  primarily those in excess of benefit levels permitted under qualified pension plans  are unfunded 
as determined with the assistance of an external actuary  the following assumptions were used at december in determining the projected benefit obligation discount rate expected return on plan assets the weighted average assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for years ended december were as follows discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase viad s pension expense was million and million for and  respectively  not including the million curtailment gain resulting from the freezing of viad s defined benefit pension plan 
pension expense is calculated based upon the actuarial assumptions shown above 
for  the pension expense consisted of service cost of million  interest cost of million  amortization of prior service cost of  recognized net actuarial loss of million less an expected return on plan assets of million 
the fair value of viad s pension plan assets decreased slightly to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to benefits paid in excess of actual returns on plan assets 
viad s discount rate used in determining future pension obligations is measured on november and is based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and viad management review 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would have increased viad s pension expense by  in developing the expected rate of return  viad employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income securities are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk 
risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
viad s current asset allocation consists of approximately percent in large capitalization and international equities  approximately percent in fixed income securities such as long term treasury bonds  intermediate government bonds and global bonds  approximately percent in a real estate limited partnership interest and percent in other securities 
the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities 
furthermore  equity securities are diversified across us and non us stocks 
other assets such as real estate and cash are used judiciously to enhance long term returns while improving portfolio diversification 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews and annual liability measurements 
additionally  historical markets are studied and long term historical relationships between equity securities and fixed income securities are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
the long term portfolio return also takes proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing 
peer data and historical returns are reviewed for reasonableness and appropriateness 
lowering the expected rate of return by basis points would have increased viad s pension expense by  viad s pension assets are primarily invested in marketable securities that have readily determinable current market values 

table of contents viad s investments are rebalanced regularly to stay within the investment guidelines 
viad will continue to evaluate its pension assumptions  including its rate of return  and will adjust these factors as necessary 
future actual pension income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in viad s pension plans 
postretirement benefits other than pensions viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided to employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad may fund the plans 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was percent for the year  gradually declining to percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the ongoing annual expense by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the ongoing annual expense by approximately  see recent accounting pronouncements below for a discussion of fasb staff position related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of which may impact viad s accounting for postretirement benefits 
weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december were as follows discount rate expected return on plan assets investment securities investment securities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
per sfas no 
 investments are classified into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
all of viad s investment securities are classified as available for sale  including securities being held for indefinite periods of time  and those securities that may be sold to assist in the clearing of payment service obligations or in the management of securities 
these securities are carried at market value or fair value  with the net after tax unrealized gain or loss reported as a separate component of stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
market value is determined by using available market information 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in general  as interest rates increase  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio and stockholders equity decreases and as interest rates fall  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio increases as well as stockholders equity 
other than temporary declines in the value of securities viad s investments consist primarily of mortgage backed securities  other asset backed securities  state and municipal government obligations and corporate debt securities 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
viad employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than book value  viad s ability and intent to hold the investment  the security rating  the underlying collateral and other factors that influence projected future cash flows 
when an other than temporary impairment occurs  investments are written down to fair market value 
subsequent increases in value are treated as an adjustment of yield 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report  viad recorded other than temporary impairment losses and interest income adjustments excluding the effects of realized gains of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily related to certain structured notes and certain other asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations held in its payment services investment portfolio during the period 
adverse changes in estimated cash flows in the future could result in impairment losses to the extent that the recorded value of such investments exceeds fair value

table of contents derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are used as part of viad s risk management strategy to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates 
viad does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendments and interpretations 
the derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  with the change in fair value recognized in earnings or in other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
a derivative that does not qualify  or is not designated  as a hedge will be reflected at fair value  with changes in value recognized through earnings 
the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments has been determined using available market information and certain valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
while viad intends to continue to meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if forecasted transactions did not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
viad does not believe it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its hedging activities as the counterparties are generally well established  well capitalized financial institutions

restructuring charges and other items as a component of the restructuring charge of million  an accrued liability related to facility closure and lease termination costs of million  net of estimated sublease income  was recorded as of december  these costs were accounted for pursuant to eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf issue no 
 these costs were considered to have no future economic benefit  and were therefore recorded at the time that viad management approved and committed to the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of the recorded amounts were based on the contractual obligations contained in the leases net of estimated sublease income and estimates of incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  under sfas no 
 a liability for the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
the liability would subsequently be adjusted for revisions related to the timing and amount of estimated cash flows and accretion expense  if applicable 
if viad had elected to early adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 the majority of the million charge related to facility closure and lease termination costs would have been recorded based on the fair value of the liability at the time viad ceased using the related leased facilities and determined using a present value technique 
the remaining portion of the million liability would have been recorded at fair value at the time the liability was incurred when services associated with the activity were received 
if viad had elected to apply the accounting method under sfas no 
 the aggregate charge of million discussed above would not have been recorded in the fourth quarter of  rather  the fair value of these liabilities  estimated to be million  would have been initially recorded in based on the restructuring plan 
furthermore  accretion expense associated with the lease termination liability would be recognized in future periods over the remaining term of the related lease agreements 
the application of sfas no 
would not have changed the method of accounting for other components of the restructuring charge including severance and other benefits of million  asset impairments of million and other charges of  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  effective for viad for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
viad s convention and event services segment derives revenues primarily by providing show services to vendors at conventions and from the design and construction of exhibit booths 
exhibit design and construction revenue is generally accounted for using the completed contract method as contracts are typically completed

the adoption of eitf issue no

in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation sets forth expanded disclosure requirements in the financial statements about a guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that  under certain circumstances  a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation at the inception of the guarantee 
certain types of guarantees  such as product warranties  guarantees accounted for as derivatives  and guarantees related to parent subsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of fin  however  they are subject to the disclosure requirements 
the initial liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  viad s guarantees principally relate to a parent s guarantee of a subsidiary s obligations to a third party and would  therefore  be excluded from liability recognition at inception 
the required disclosures pursuant to fin are included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on viad s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin prescribes how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
fin requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
fin was effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the interpretation originally applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  in october  the fasb issued staff position fsp fin  which delayed the effective application date of fin for those interests until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  in december  the fasb issued fin r  which clarifies definitions and the application of the requirements included in fin prior to the adoption of fin r  viad changed the structure of two of its investments in collateralized debt obligations which would have otherwise required consolidation of the underlying asset securitizations under the new rules 
viad exchanged the structured note for each investment representing the combined interests in the collateralized debt obligation and an investment grade security with the trustee and accepted delivery of the individual securities comprising the structured note 
as a result  viad s ownership interests in the underlying asset securitizations were reduced such that viad was no longer considered the primary beneficiary  and therefore  consolidation was not required under fin r 
viad has adopted the required elements of fin r as of december  the adoption of fin and fin r did not have a material effect on viad s financial position or results of operations

sfas no 
requires that financial instruments within its scope be classified as liabilities 
viad adopted sfas no 
on july   and accordingly  reclassified its redeemable preferred stock carrying value of million as a long term liability in the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 dividends on the preferred stock have been recorded as interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no

in january  the fasb issued fsp on the accounting for the effect of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act enacted into law on december  although sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  requires that recently enacted changes in the law that take effect in future periods be considered in current period liability determination  fsp permits the deferral 
table of contents of recognition of the effects of the act until further authoritative guidance is issued 
however  fsp requires that the one time election to defer or not defer the accounting for the effects of the act must be made before net periodic postretirement benefit costs for the period that includes december  are first included in either interim or annual financial statements 
as viad s measurement date is november  the one time election is not required until first quarter as a result  the consolidated financial statements do not include the effects of the act and consequently the impact on viad s future financial position and results of operations cannot presently be determined 
in december  the fasb issued a revised version of sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised statement  which does not change the methodology underlying the measurement of obligations or calculation of expense associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans  makes several significant changes to the required disclosures about such plans to provide more information about plan assets  obligations  benefit payments  contributions and net benefit costs 
the majority of the additional disclosures are required for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the required disclosures pursuant to sfas no 
are included in the notes to consolidated financial statements

actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
viad s businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties 
among other things  gains and losses of customers  consumer demand patterns  labor relations  purchasing decisions related to customer demand for convention and event services  existing and new competition  industry alliances and consolidation and growth patterns within the industries in which viad competes  and any further deterioration in the economy may individually or in combination impact future results 
in addition to the factors mentioned elsewhere  economic  competitive  governmental  technological  capital marketplace and other factors including further terrorist activities or war could affect the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser degree  relate to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the market value and earnings of viad 
foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect earnings 
viad s exposure to these risks is primarily associated with its payment services segment business 
certain derivative financial instruments are used as part of viad s risk management strategy to manage these exposures 
derivatives are not used for speculative purposes 
viad has exposure to changing rates related to its pension assumptions including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate 
viad is exposed to foreign exchange risk as it has certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
viad primarily utilizes forward contracts to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
forward contracts relating to the payment services segment s money transfer transactions generally have maturities less than days  and forward contracts relating to other receivables or payables generally have maturities less than days 
the forward contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the foreign denominated receivables and payables  net of the effect of the related forward contracts  is not significant 
a portion of viad s payment services segment business involves the payment of commissions to financial institution customers of its official check program 
a payment services segment subsidiary also has entered into agreements to sell receivables primarily from its money order agents 
the commissions and net proceeds from the agent receivables sales are computed based on short term variable interest rates that subject viad to risk arising from changes in these rates 
viad has mitigated a substantial portion of the variable rate risk through swap agreements which convert the variable rate payments to fixed rates 
stockholders equity can be adversely affected by changing interest rates  as after tax changes in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale and in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are included as a component of stockholders equity 
the fair value of derivative financial instruments generally increases when the market value of fixed rate  long term debt investments decline and vice versa 
however  an increase or decrease in stockholders equity related to changes in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale  may not be offset  in whole or in part  by the decrease or increase in stockholders equity related to changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
viad is also exposed to short term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations 
viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for these obligations 
earnings sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on a hypothetical percent proportionate increase in interest rates from the average level of interest rates during the last twelve months  and taking into consideration expected investment positions  commissions paid to selling agents  growth in new business  effects of the swap agreements and expected borrowing level of variable rate debt  the increase in pre tax income would be approximately million 
a hypothetical percent proportionate decrease in interest rates  based on the same set of assumptions  would result in a decrease in pre tax income of approximately million 
these amounts are estimated based on a certain set of assumptions about interest rates and portfolio balance growth and do not represent expected results 
in addition  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of viad s results of operations and the financial impact of interest rate fluctuations 
fair value sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the fair value of securities classified as available for sale  derivative financial instruments and fixed rate debt are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a percent proportionate increase in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale of approximately million reflected as an after tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million  an estimated increase in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of approximately million reflected as an after tax increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million and an estimated off balance sheet decrease in the fair value of fixed rate debt of approximately  at december  a percent proportionate decrease in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale of approximately million reflected as an after tax increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million  an estimated decrease in the fair value of derivative financial instruments of approximately million reflected as an after tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million and an estimated off balance sheet increase in the fair value of fixed rate debt of approximately  at december  these amounts are estimated based on a certain set of assumptions about interest rates and portfolio balance growth and are not necessarily indicative of actual current period factors 

table of contents interest rate risk and market risk oversight 
viad has established several levels of risk management oversight and control 
an investment committee  comprised of senior officers of viad and the payment services segment  and reporting to the chief executive officer of viad  routinely reviews investment and risk management strategies and results 
viad maintains formal procedures for entering into derivative transactions and management regularly monitors and reports to the audit committee on such activity 
derivative agreements are with major financial institutions which are currently expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements  thereby mitigating the credit risk from the transactions in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties 
in addition  viad regularly monitors the credit ratings of the counterparties and the likelihood of default is considered remote
