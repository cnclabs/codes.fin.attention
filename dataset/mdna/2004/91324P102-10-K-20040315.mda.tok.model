expansion and divestiture of operations we continually evaluate expansion opportunities in all our businesses and  in the normal course of business  often consider whether to sell certain businesses or stop offering certain products or services 
expansion opportunities may include acquiring businesses that are complementary to our existing operations 
we also devote significant attention to internally developing new products and services for the health and well being sector as we have broadly defined it 
during  we completed several acquisitions and ceased offering some products in certain markets  all as part of our ongoing emphasis on our strategic focus 
government regulation most of our health and well being services are regulated 
this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
these revisions could affect our consolidated operations and financial results 
enactment of federal and state health benefit laws and regulations can also affect our businesses 
federal regulation our health care services segment  which includes unitedhealthcare  ovations  and americhoice 
ovations has medicare advantage contracts that are regulated by cms 
cms has the right to audit our performance in order to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to members 
our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees  payment for those services  and other aspects of these programs 
there is a significant level of regulation surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance 
in addition  because a portion of ingenix business includes clinical research  it is subject to regulation by the fda 
we believe we are in compliance with the applicable regulations 
we believe we are in compliance with these regulations 
state regulation all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and health maintenance products regulate those products and operations 
these states require periodic financial reports from us and impose minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements 
many of our health plans and each of our insurance subsidiaries are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations 
such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain inter company transactions and general business operations 
some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material inter company transfers of assets  as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates 
in addition  some of our subsidiaries or products may be subject to ppo  managed care organization mco or tpa related regulations and licensure requirements 
these regulations differ greatly from state to state  but generally contain network  contracting  product and rate  financial and reporting requirements 
many states also have enacted laws and or adopted regulations governing utilization review and external appeals activities  and these laws may apply to some of our operations 
additionally  there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for 
table of contents delivery of services  prompt payment of claims  confidentiality of consumer health information and covered benefits and services 
hipaa the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended hipaa  apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets  including self funded employee benefit plans 
federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are now effective 
these regulations include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets  and for the privacy and security of protected health information 
we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations 
new standards for national provider and employer identifiers are currently being developed by regulators 
we intend to be in compliance by the enforcement dates 
however  where the law is far reaching and complex or the government delays in providing guidance on some aspects of the law  the timeliness of our compliance efforts may be affected 
additionally  different approaches to hipaa s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
erisa the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer sponsored health benefit plans 
erisa is a complex set of laws and regulations that is subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor as well as the federal courts 
erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans  particularly those that maintain self funded plans 
during  we processed and administered the payment of approximately billion of medical claims on behalf of customers that self insure the medical costs of their employees and their employees dependents 
erisa claim regulations which became effective july require ongoing modifications to our operations 
we believe that we are in compliance with the regulations 
fraud and abuse the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid are complex and changing 
we continue to emphasize our regulatory compliance efforts for these programs  but ongoing vigorous law enforcement and the highly technical nature of the regulations mean that compliance efforts in this arena will continue to require significant resources 
additionally  states have begun to focus their anti fraud efforts on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations 
some states now require filing and approval of anti fraud plans and may monitor compliance as part of any market conduct examination 
we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations and contractual requirements 
audits and investigations we are regularly subject to governmental audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
any such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  a state department of insurance or other state or federal authority including cms  the office of the inspector general and state attorneys general may from time to time begin a special audit of one of our health plans  our insurance plans or one of our other operations to investigate issues such as utilization management  financial  eligibility or other data reporting  prompt claims payment  or coverage determinations for medical services  including emergency room care 
we are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance departments and state attorneys general  the office of personnel management  the office of the inspector general  the office of civil rights  and us attorneys 
we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations  audits or reviews  
table of contents individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
international regulation our ingenix  uniprise and health care services segments have limited international operations 
these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions  including various tax  tariff and trade regulations  as well as employment  intellectual property and investment rules and laws 
marketing our marketing strategy is defined and coordinated by each business dedicated marketing staff 
within these businesses  primary marketing responsibility generally resides with a marketing leader and a direct sales force 
in addition  several of the segments also rely upon independent insurance agents and brokers to sell some of their products 
marketing efforts also include public relations efforts and advertising programs that may use television  radio  newspapers  magazines  billboards  direct mail and telemarketing 
competition as a diversified health and well being services company we operate in highly competitive markets 
our competitors include managed health care companies  insurance companies  third party administrators and business services outsourcing companies  health care providers that have formed networks to directly contract with employers  specialty benefit providers  government entities  and various information and consulting companies 
for our uniprise and health care services businesses  competitors include aetna  anthem  cigna  coventry  humana  pacificare  oxford  wellpoint  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas 
our specialized care services and ingenix business segments also compete with a number of businesses 
new entrants into the markets in which we compete  as well as consolidation within these markets  also contribute to a competitive environment 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting us and the sales and pricing of our products and services include product innovation  consumer satisfaction  the level and quality of products and services  network capabilities  price  market share  product distribution systems  efficient administration operations  financial strength and marketplace reputation 
we believe that our competitive strengths are enhanced by our customer focus resulting from our operational alignment 
each unitedhealth group business represents a strategic platform from which we can penetrate more deeply into specific markets using our three core competencies network management  knowledge and information and service infrastructure 
other strengths include the breadth and quality of our products  our geographic scope and diversity  the scope and depth of our data and information about health care costs and consumption  our effective use of proprietary tools and products to coordinate and facilitate programs designed to realize appropriately lower health care costs  our disciplined underwriting and pricing practices and staff  our significant market position in certain geographic areas  the strength of our distribution network  our financial strength  our generally large provider networks that provide more consumer choice and minimize barriers to access  our point of service products and our strong marketplace reputation 
however  in some markets we may be at a disadvantage for a number of reasons  including competitors with more resources  longer operating histories  larger market shares  broader networks  narrower networks which may allow greater cost control and lower prices or more established names and reputations 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals 
we believe our employee relations are favorable

table of contents cautionary statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k  and in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of our annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
when used in this annual report on form k and in future filings by us with the securities and exchange commission  in our press releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers  the words or phrases believes  anticipates  intends  will likely result  estimates  projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider 
this discussion is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra 
except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws  in making these cautionary statements  we do not undertake to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results  and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  any of the matters discussed below may have affected our past  as well as current  forward looking statements about future results 
any or all forward looking statements in this form k  in the annual report to shareholders  and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications 
we must effectively manage our health care costs 
under risk based product arrangements  we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums 
premium revenues from risk based products excluding aarp comprise approximately of our total consolidated revenues 
we use approximately to of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our customers 
the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict  price for  and effectively manage health care costs 
total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a month period and is generally priced one to four months before contract commencement 
services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the contract commences 
although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period  inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by one percent for unitedhealthcare s commercial insured products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which the underlying claims have not been received by us or for which the claims have been received but not processed 
if these estimates prove too high or too low  the effect of the change will be included in future results 

table of contents we face intense competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face significant competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate 
for our uniprise and health care services businesses  competitors include aetna  anthem  cigna  coventry  humana  pacificare  oxford  wellpoint  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas 
our specialized care services and ingenix businesses also compete with a number of businesses 
moreover  we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial  so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
in particular markets  these competitors may have capabilities that give them a competitive advantage 
greater market share  established reputation  superior supplier arrangements  existing business relationships  and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries 
this level of consolidation makes it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  and to maintain or advance profitability 
our relationship with aarp is significant to our ovations business 
under our year contract with aarp which we entered into in  we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members 
as of december   our portion of aarp s insurance program represented approximately billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately million aarp members 
the aarp contract may be terminated early by us or aarp under certain circumstances  including a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material adverse change in the financial condition of either party  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangement depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
additionally  events that adversely affect aarp or one of its other business partners for its member insurance program could have an adverse effect on the success of our arrangement with aarp 
for example  if customers were dissatisfied with the products aarp offered or its reputation  if federal legislation limited opportunities in the medicare market  or if the services provided by aarp s other business partners were unacceptable  our business could be adversely affected 
the effects of the new medicare reform legislation on our business are uncertain 
recently enacted medicare reform legislation is complex and wide ranging 
there are numerous provisions in the legislation that will influence our business  although at this early stage  it is difficult to predict the extent to which our business will be affected 
while uncertain as to impact  we believe the increased funding provided in the legislation will intensify competition in the seniors health services market 
our business is subject to intense government scrutiny and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations 
our business is regulated at the federal  state  local and international levels 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products  to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions 
delays in obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 

table of contents we participate in federal  state and local government health care coverage programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past and may do so in the future 
state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues 
legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  physician reimbursement methods and payment rates  coverage determinations  claim payments and processing  use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information  and government sponsored programs 
we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation  or  if enacted  what their terms will be  but their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability  require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for a loss of business 
we are also subject to various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
such oversight could result in our loss of licensure or our right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could damage our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
we are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general  the office of personnel management  the office of the inspector general and us attorney general 
we depend on our relationships with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for favorable prices 
a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws 
in any particular market  these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
the nature of our business exposes us to significant litigation risks and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some of the costs associated with litigation 
periodically  we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design  management and offerings of our services 
these matters include  but are not limited to  claims related to health care benefits coverage  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
in  a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business 
the suits are purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes  including erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico 
although the expenses which we have incurred to date in defending the class action lawsuits have not been material to our business  we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of the class action litigation and other matters  even if they are without merit 

table of contents following the events of september   the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly 
as a result  we have increased the amount of risk that we self insure  particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business 
we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self insurance  however  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters 
although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate  it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 
our businesses depend significantly on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and to accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of our acquisition activities  we have acquired additional systems 
we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes  have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
we depend on independent third parties  such as ibm and medco health solutions  inc  with whom we have entered into agreements  for significant portions of our data center operations and pharmacy benefits management and processing  respectively 
even though we have appropriate provisions in our agreement with ibm and medco  including provisions with respect to specific performance standards  covenants  warranties  audit rights  indemnification  and other provisions  our dependence on these third parties makes our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform adequately under the contracts  due to internal or external factors 
although there are a limited number of service organizations with the size  scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services  especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing and management  we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms 
a change in service providers  however  could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms 
we must comply with emerging restrictions on patient privacy  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information when providing services to us 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at international  federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley act and hipaa 
hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates  we still have limited control over their actions and practices 
compliance with these proposals and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes  and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
our knowledge and information related businesses depend significantly on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions 
table of contents may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services 
the effects of the war on terror and future terrorist attacks could have a severe impact on the health care industry 
the terrorist attacks launched on september   the war on terrorism  the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  the us economy in general and our industry specifically 
depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could lead to  among other things  increased use of health care services including  without limitation  hospital and physician services  loss of membership in health plans we administer as a result of lay offs or other reductions of employment  adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees  disruption of our information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk  such as acts of terrorism  and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general 
the market price of our common stock may be particularly sensitive due to the nature of the business in which we operate 
the market prices of the securities of the publicly held companies in the industry in which we operate have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many external factors  including general market trends  public communications regarding managed care  litigation and judicial decisions  legislative or regulatory actions  health care cost trends  pricing trends  competition  earnings  membership reports of particular industry participants and acquisition activity 
despite our specific outlook or prospects  the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of any of these external factors 
by way of illustration  our stock price has ranged from on december  to on december  as adjusted to reflect stock splits and dividends 
item properties as of december   we leased approximately million and owned approximately  aggregate square feet of space in the united states and europe 
our leases expire at various dates through may  our various segments use this space exclusively for their respective business purposes and we believe these current facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are adequate for our anticipated future needs 
item legal proceedings in re managed care litigation mdl no 
beginning in  a series of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business 
a multi district litigation panel has consolidated several litigation cases involving unitedhealth group and our affiliates in the southern district court of florida  miami division 
in december  the unitedhealth group litigation was consolidated with litigation involving other industry members 
generally  the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of erisa and rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits 
other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered

a trial date has been set for september  the american medical association et al 
v 
metropolitan life insurance company  united healthcare services  inc and unitedhealth group 
this lawsuit was filed on march   in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york 
on april   we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa  as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  deceptive acts and practices  and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers 
the suit seeks declaratory  injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs  fees and interest payments 
an amended complaint was filed on august   which alleged two classes of plaintiffs  an erisa class and a non erisa class 
after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association  a third amended complaint was filed 
on october   the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint 
we are engaged in discovery in this matter 
because of the nature of our business  we are routinely subject to lawsuits alleging various causes of action 
some of these suits may include claims for substantial non economic  treble or punitive damages 
we record liabilities for our estimate of probable costs resulting from these matters 
although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain  we do not believe the results of any such actions  including those described above  or any other types of actions  currently threatened or pending  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
