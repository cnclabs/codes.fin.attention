item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of oral drugs to treat infectious diseases and metabolic disorders 
we have development programs that include fungal infections  malaria  tuberculosis  diabetes  pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and tropical medicine diseases  including african sleeping sickness trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis 
we hold worldwide patents  patent applications  and licenses to worldwide patents  patent applications and technologies from a scientific consortium and exclusive rights to commercialize products from patents and licenses that are integral to our business 
we intend to work with our scientific and foundation partners to validate our technology platform  illustrating dications low toxicity  broad application  and oral deliverability 
we plan in the near future to sell drugs for compassionate use in niche markets as we further develop drugs to target multi billion dollar markets such as antifungal  tb  diabetes and cancer treatments 
as a validation of our efforts  the united states food and drug administration fda has granted fast track designation of db for treatment of african sleeping sickness 
fast track designation allows for expedited fda regulatory review of db for african sleeping sickness 
since our formation in october  we have engaged in research and development programs  expanding our network of scientists and scientific advisors  licensing technology agreements and advancing the commercialization of the dication technology platform 
to minimize shareholders dilution  we use foundation and government grants  the expertise and resources of strategic partners and third parties in a number of areas  including i laboratory research  ii pre clinical and human clinical trials and iii manufacture of pharmaceutical drugs 
we have licensing and exclusive commercialization rights to a dicationic anti infective pharmaceutical platform and are developing drugs intended for commercial use based on that platform 
dication pharmaceutical drugs structural class defined by molecules with positive charges on each end held together by a linker work by blocking life sustaining enzymes from binding to the key sites in the minor groove of an organism s dna  thereby killing the infectious organisms that cause fungal  parasitic  bacterial and viral diseases 
the key site on an organism s dna is an area where enzymes interact with the infectious organism s dna as part of their normal life cycle 
structurally  dications are chemical molecules that have two positively charged ends held together by a chemical linker 
the composition of the dications  with positive charges on both ends shaped like molecular barbells allows dications to bind similar to a band aid to the negatively charged key sites of an infectious microorganism s dna 
the bound dications block the life sustaining enzymes from attaching to the dna s key sites  thereby killing the infectious organism 
with the exception of certain research funding agreements and certain grants  we have not generated any revenue from operations 
for the period from inception october  to march   we incurred cumulative net losses of approximately  we have incurred additional losses since such date and we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we expect that our cash sources for at least the next year will be limited to o payments from the university of north carolina at chapel hill  charitable foundations and other research collaborators under arrangements that may be entered into in the future  and o research grants  such as small business technology transfer program sttr grants and small business innovation research sbir grants  o borrowing funds or the issuance of securities 
the timing and amounts of grant and payment revenues  if any  will likely fluctuate sharply and depend upon the achievement of specified milestones  and results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the fair value of our preferred and common stock and related options and warrants  the recognition of revenues and costs related to our research contracts  and the useful lives or impairment of our property and equipment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
grants to perform research are our primary source of revenue and are generally granted to support research and development activities for specific projects or drug candidates 
revenue related to grants to perform research and development is recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the specific grant 
upfront cash payments from research and development grants are reported as deferred revenue until such time as the research and development activities covered by the grant are performed 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
we record stock based compensation expense for non employees at the fair value of the options or warrants granted in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
the fair value of options granted to non employees is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the model considers a number of factors  including the market price and volatility of our common stock at the date of measurement 
we measure the compensation expense for options and warrants granted to non employees as the underlying options vest 
the compensation expense related to all grants is being amortized using the graded vesting method  in accordance with sfas  eitf and fasb interpretation no 
 over the vesting period of each respective stock option 
we believe that the accounting policies affecting these estimates are our critical accounting policies 
research and development expenses all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab supplies  preclinical studies  raw materials to manufacture clinical trial drugs  manufacturing costs  sponsored research at other labs  consulting  and research related overhead
