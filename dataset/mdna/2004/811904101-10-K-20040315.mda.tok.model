item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview seacor is in the business of owning  operating  investing in  marketing and remarketing equipment  primarily in the offshore oil and gas and inland transportation industries 
it also provides oil spill response and environmental remediation services 
the company s principal subsidiaries are divided among the following three business segments offshore marine services  environmental services  and other  which includes its inland river services and aviation services businesses 
the primary assets used in these businesses include marine vessels or workboats  environmental spill response equipment  inland river barges and towboats and helicopters 
the company s largest business segment  offshore marine services  operates vessels servicing offshore oil and gas exploration and production around the world 
these vessels deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations  handle anchors for drilling rigs and other marine equipment  support offshore construction and maintenance work and provide standby safety support and oil spill response services 
offshore marine services works for both major integrated oil companies and small independents in the following five principal geographic locations including the us gulf of mexico  latin america and mexico  the north sea  west africa  and asia 
environmental services provides contractual spill response and site remediation services 
it acquired a complementary business in that expanded its range of services to include hazardous waste management  industrial and marine cleaning and site remediation services on the west coast 
results of environmental services can vary greatly in terms of profitability and operating margins from year to year 
in  environmental services provided emergency oil spill response services in support of operation iraqi freedom 
these services  which have been completed  generated significant increases in foreign operating revenues and profits 
as this specific response required an unusually high degree of logistical support and involved a high level of risk  the margin of profit  relative to operating revenues  was greater than would be the case with a typical remediation project undertaken on land in the us although remediation projects are a regular activity  responses to emergencies on a large scale are episodic 
environmental services  while not capital intensive  is people intensive and  depending on the specific service rendered  its margins can be highly variable 
the majority of the company s assets are employed servicing cyclical industries 
the earnings power of those assets is subject to the varying nature of demand within industries they support 
the supply of competing assets is often countercyclical to underlying demand  such that over capacity can occur even when demand is at reasonable levels 
offshore marine services  inland river services and aviation services are highly capital intensive businesses 
to successfully manage these businesses over time  the company believes it is often necessary to re allocate capital among different classes of assets and across a variety of industries 
the company also believes that maintaining sufficient liquidity is important to weather business cycles and provide the resources necessary to take advantage of opportunities as they develop 
in december  the company diversified its energy related asset mix through the acquisition of tex air 
although tex air operates a fleet of helicopters primarily dedicated to the offshore oil and gas sector  the considerations governing the supply of such equipment are not necessarily the same as with marine vessels 
in addition  tex air s assets can be used in seismic work  aerial photography  vip transportation and to service the healthcare industry 
the results of aviation services are included in the company s other business segment along with inland river services 
for the past several years  the company has been pursuing a strategy of reducing its overall exposure to the offshore marine services industry and adjusting the mix of equipment it operates 
in  the company embarked on a program of purchasing new dry cargo barges and acquired scf corporation  a company that owned  operated and managed dry cargo barges on the us inland waterways 
in the years since that acquisition  the company has continued to invest in new barges and plans to commit substantial capital to inland river services in the demand for inland river barges  while subject to economic cycles  is not subject to the same underlying forces that determine activity in offshore marine services 
the dynamic of the supply side of this business is also different 
the company believes that inland river services provides an attractive alternative for investment of capital relative to offshore marine services 
as a result of its committed new construction plan  the company believes that inland river services will become a separately reported segment in the number of dry cargo barges in inland river services fleet has grown from units at the end of to at the end of as a great deal of this equipment was added in the third and fourth quarters of  its impact on revenues and results for the year was not commensurate with the magnitude of investment 
inland river services fleet is expected to exceed  units by the end of consolidated results of operations overview the table below provides an analysis of the company s consolidated statements of income for each year indicated

an increase in operating revenues earned by environmental services and inland river services and resulting from the commencement of aviation services was substantially offset by a decline in operating revenues of offshore marine services 
consolidated net income declined to million and diluted earnings per share declined to 
between comparable years  consolidated net income was primarily impacted by the after tax effect of a i million decline in consolidated operating income  in which significantly lower offshore marine services profits and aviation services losses exceeded the improved results of environmental services and inland river services  ii million non recurring gain recognized in in connection with the chiles merger  iii million increase in income from derivative transactions and the sale of marketable securities  iv million increase in income from the sale of offshore marine services vessels  v million increase in net interest expense and vi million decline in equity earnings

in  reduced demand for offshore marine services vessels in the us and declining retainer activities in environmental services in the us lowered consolidated operating revenues by  or million 
these declines were partly offset by a  or million  increase in consolidated operating revenues earned by the company s other business segment as a result of us fleet expansion in inland river services 
operating revenues earned in foreign regions improved during due to north sea and west african fleet expansion in offshore marine services and as a result of the relocation of vessels from the us to latin america and mexico 
results for include the effect on consolidated operating revenues of relocating certain vessels from the us to west africa and other foreign regions 
a more detailed discussion of consolidated operating revenue for each of the company s business segments can be found below 
in  consolidated operating revenues increased  or million  due to improved results in the environmental services and other business segments 
spill response activities improved in both the us and other foreign markets  principally iraq 
the company again added dry cargo barges to inland river services fleet and aviation services commenced operations in these improvements in consolidated operating revenues were substantially offset by a  or million  decline in the results of offshore marine services 
demand for us vessels remained depressed and weakened for many of offshore marine services vessels operating in the north sea and west africa 
between years  the company also reduced the size of its offshore marine services domestic and foreign vessel fleets and repositioned vessels between geographic regions of operation 
in  and  offshore marine services earned  and  and environmental services earned  and  of their respective operating revenues in the us environmental services operating revenues increased significantly in foreign markets during due to increased spill response activities in iraq 
the company s other business segment activities  including both inland river services and aviation services  are presently concentrated in the us geographic regions of the world in which the company earns operating revenues may vary widely between years as a result of the mobility of offshore marine services vessels and the unpredictability of the number  severity and location of oil spills to which environmental services may respond 
operating expenses by business segment the operating expenses of the company s business segments are presented in the following table for each year indicated 
of of of in thousands amount revenues amount revenues amount revenues offshore marine services    environmental services    other    elimination  consolidated operating expenses 
   consolidated operating expenses increased by to million in and to million in operating expenses of offshore marine services increased in as a result of net fleet additions and escalating costs associated with vessel operations 
other business segment expenses also increased in due to the commencement of operation of new dry cargo barges 
these increases were partly offset by lower environmental services operating expenses that resulted from reduced retainer business activity 
in  operating expense savings that resulted from net vessel dispositions in offshore marine services were partly offset by escalating costs associated with vessel operations 
operating expenses of environmental services increased due to increased spill response activities and the acquisition in the fourth quarter of an environmental services company serving the west coast of the us inland river services fleet expansion again increased other business segment operating expenses along with the commencement of aviation services 
a more detailed discussion of operating expenses for each of the company s business segments can be found below 
consolidated operating expenses as a percent of consolidated operating revenues increased to in and in the increase in both years was due primarily to declining offshore marine services operating revenues that resulted from lower fleet utilization and rates per day worked and escalating costs associated with vessel operations 
consolidated operating expenses additionally increased as a percent of consolidated operating revenues in environmental services new west coast operations and aviation services earned marginal profits and inland river services operating expenses escalated during the year

administrative and general expenses additionally increased in as a result of fleet acquisitions in offshore marine services  expanded information technology support infrastructure and higher corporate development and travel expenses 
the increase in administrative and general expense in resulted primarily from the commencement of aviation services  a substantial increase in employee termination benefit expenses in offshore marine services associated with reductions in the size of our fleet  increased insurance expenses and increased legal and professional services 
declines in performance based incentive compensation partly offset these cost increases 
depreciation and amortization the depreciation and amortization of the company s business segments are presented in the following table for each year indicated 
in thousands offshore marine services    environmental services    other    corporate elimination consolidated deprecation and amortization 
   depreciation and amortization expense  primarily related to offshore support vessels  inland river barges and helicopters  decreased to million in and to million in a decline in expense during that resulted from the cessation of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  and various environmental services assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives was partly offset by increased depreciation expense that resulted from the acquisition of dry cargo barges 
in  a decline in depreciation expense that resulted from net vessel dispositions in offshore marine services and additional environmental services assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives was substantially offset by an increase in depreciation expense that resulted from the acquisition of additional dry cargo barges and the commencement of aviation services resulting from the tex air acquisition 
other income  net other income  net  the components of which are presented in the following table for each year indicated  increased to million in and decreased to million in in thousands net interest expense    income from equipment sales or retirements  net    gain upon sale of shares of chiles  derivative income loss  net    foreign currency transaction gains  net    other  net    net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased to million in but increased by to million in interest expense decreased in with the company s repayment of loans that financed vessel acquisitions  redemption of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes due the notes and entry into interest swap agreements with respect to the company s senior notes due september  the notes 
offsetting interest expense declines in was a million decrease in interest income resulting from lower invested cash balances and interest rates 
interest expense increased in due to the issuance of the company s senior notes due october the notes in september in addition  even though the company has not had any specific borrowing associated with vessel construction activity  pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles  the company capitalizes interest cost attributable to progress payments made to shipyards 
those payments increased in and capitalized interest totaled million during the year 
another significant factor contributing to the increase in net interest expense was the decline in rates on short term deposits 
net interest expense is expected to again rise in due to the company s termination in the fourth quarter of of interest swap agreements with respect to its notes 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional discussion of interest rate swap agreements 
the sale by the company in the fourth quarter of of all its long term fixed income marketable securities is expected to lower interest income in the coming year 
additionally  shipyard progress payments are projected to decline in and lower capitalized interest in the coming year 
income from equipment sales or retirements  net 
income from equipment sales or retirements decreased to million in but increased to million in equipment sale activities in resulted principally from the disposition of vessels  including pursuant to sale leaseback transactions that resulted in income deferral  totaling million 
in  additional offshore support vessels were sold during the year  including pursuant to sale leaseback transactions that resulted in income deferral  totaling million 
income deferred as a result of sale leaseback transactions is being amortized against vessel rental expense over the applicable lease terms 
during december  management determined to divest offshore marine services utility fleet 
during  the company sold utility boats 
at december   the company still owned utility vessels all of which were retired from service and are being marketed for sale 
gain upon sale of shares of chiles 
a non recurring gain of million in resulted from the chiles merger 
derivative income loss  net 
results from derivative transactions declined million in but improved million in net losses of million were recognized upon settlement of us treasury note and bond options and future contracts in  whereas  net gains resulted from comparable transactions in the prior year 
the settlement of us treasury rate lock agreements and a transaction that hedged the company s share ownership position in ensco acquired from the chiles merger resulted in additional derivative losses during an increase in unrealized gains from interest rate swap agreements partly offset these declines 
in  net gains were recognized from the settlement of us treasury note and bond options and future contracts and a transaction that hedged the company s share ownership position in ensco  whereas  net losses resulted from comparable transactions in the prior year 
foreign currency transaction gains  net 
net foreign currency exchange gains increased to million  then decreased to million in in both years  net foreign currency exchange gains were due primarily to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany loans denominated in pounds sterling and other transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of various seacor subsidiaries that are part of offshore marine services 
in both and  the pound sterling currency strengthened against the us dollar 
other  net 
in and  other  net principally included marketable security sale gains and debt extinguishment losses and additionally included an impairment charge with respect to an investment that was accounted for using the cost method 
security sale gains primarily resulted from the sale of equity securities 
debt extinguishment losses resulted primarily from the write off of deferred financing costs and the payment of premium upon the retirement of indebtedness 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate increased to in from in and due primarily to the provision of a million valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that may expire before utilization and a million tax consequence of non deductible expenses 
equity earnings equity in earnings of or less owned companies declined to million in and to million in results in declined as the company ceased to report equity in the earnings of chiles following the chiles merger and recognized an impairment charge with respect to the company s investment in an entity that develops and sells software to the ship brokerage and shipping industry 
results of the prior year included a non recurring gain from the sale of a handymax dry bulk ship by a bulk carrier joint venture 
equity in the improved results of offshore marine services ventures operating in singapore  trinidad  egypt and greece and lower operating losses of globe wireless partly offset these declines 
results for declined due primarily to a million charge for us income taxes payable on a dividend received from offshore marine services joint venture in mexico 
earnings were also reduced by million as the company ceased to report equity in the earnings of chiles following the chiles merger in and as a result of lower profits earned by offshore marine services joint ventures operating in trinidad  singapore and the uk weak demand lowered joint venture results in trinidad 
two vessels operating in asia were sold at a loss 
significant repairs were performed on a north sea joint venture vessel 
declines were partly offset by improved results from offshore marine services joint venture results in argentina  chile and brazil due to increased vessel utilization and fleet growth 
the operating losses of globe wireless declined between years 
prior year results included a non recurring impairment charge relating to the company s investment in an entity that develops and sells software to the ship brokerage and shipping industry 
offshore marine services general through seacor s subsidiaries and its joint venture arrangements  offshore marine services  the company s principal business segment  is primarily dedicated to operating a diversified fleet of offshore support vessels that service oil and gas exploration and production facilities mainly in the us gulf of mexico  the north sea  latin america and mexico  west africa and asia 
offshore marine services vessels carry cargo and personnel to and from offshore installations  handle anchors for drilling rigs and other marine equipment  support offshore construction and maintenance work  provide standby safety support and oil spill response services 
from time to time  vessels also service special projects  such as well stimulation  seismic data gathering and freight hauling 
in addition to vessel services  offshore marine services offers logistics services  including shorebase  marine transport and other supply chain management services in support of offshore oil and gas exploration and production operations 
fleet since its inception  the company has actively monitored opportunities to buy and sell vessels to maximize the overall utility and flexibility of its fleet 
offshore marine services has expanded its fleet through the purchase of vessels from competitors  equity investments in joint ventures that own vessels and construction of new equipment 
since  offshore marine services has spent approximately as much on new construction as it has on the acquisition of existing fleets or second hand vessels 
the table below sets forth the company s fleet ownership structure at the dates indicated 
at december  fleet structure domestic owned bareboat chartered in managed joint ventures and pool foreign owned bareboat chartered in managed joint ventures vessels chartered in primarily in sale leaseback transactions 
of joint ventured vessels  were owned and were chartered in by joint ventures in which the company owned less than a majority interest and participated in joint ventures in which the company owned the majority interest 
one vessel owned by a third party participates in a pool with additional vessels owned by the company 
operating revenue and expense drivers operating revenue drivers 
the number and type of offshore marine services vessels  rates per day worked and utilization levels are the key determinants of operating revenues and results 
unless the company decides to lay up a vessel  operating costs are static  irrespective of utilization or rates 
in some instances the cost of lay up would necessitate paying redundancy expenses thereby making it more economical to keep a vessel in service  even if current utilization and rates do not cover daily operating expenses 
the company does not believe  however  in keeping equipment in service simply to avoid the cost of redundancy and does so only when it expects that conditions will improve soon enough to make it impractical to release personnel and re hire them on a timely basis 
operating revenues are derived primarily from chartering vessels to its customers for specified periods of time at agreed rates time charter 
these vessels are either owned or chartered in by offshore marine services 
when offshore marine services charters vessels from other owners  it is usually on a bareboat charter basis 
in such arrangements offshore marine services is responsible for all vessel operating expenses plus a rental fee to the owner 
on rare occasions  offshore marine services also charters vessels from other operators  fully found 
in these instances the charter rate includes all operating expenses 
as charter hire payable to third parties and bareboat expenses are included in operating expenses  operating margins are impacted 
when vessels are sold and leased back bareboat chartered  depreciation and finance charges become indirectly assimilated into operating expense via the lease payment 
offshore marine services also provides management services to other vessel owners and recognizes related management fees in operating revenues but does not recognize charter revenues or vessel expenses of the managed vessels 
rates per day worked and utilization of offshore marine services fleet are a function of demand and availability in marine vessel markets  which are closely aligned with the level of exploration and development of offshore areas 
numerous factors impact the demand side of this equation 
short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices  which in turn are related to demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources  have in the past been good leading indicators of activity 
in recent years  however  that has not been the case 
the decision to invest capital offshore is also a function of alternatives for investment  whether it be share re purchases by oil and gas producers  merger opportunities  or availability of more promising acreage on land 
the rate per day worked for any vessel with respect to any period is the ratio of total time charter revenue of such vessel to the aggregate number of days worked by such vessel for such period 
utilization with respect to any vessel during a given period is the ratio of aggregate number of days worked by such vessel to total calendar days available for work during such period 
utilization is impacted by availability of work and also availability of the vessel for service 
the factors that affect service downtime are scheduled and unscheduled repairs 
the table below sets forth rates per day worked and utilization data for offshore marine services fleet during the periods indicated 
fleet rates per day worked anchor handling towing supply domestic    anchor handling towing supply foreign    crew    geophysical  freight and other  mini supply    standby safety    supply and towing supply domestic    supply and towing supply foreign    utility    utilization anchor handling towing supply domestic anchor handling towing supply foreign crew geophysical  freight and other mini supply standby safety supply and towing supply domestic supply and towing supply foreign utility overall fleet excludes owned vessels that are bareboat chartered out  vessels owned by corporations that participate in pooling arrangements with offshore marine services  minority owned joint venture vessels and managed vessels and includes vessels bareboat and time chartered in by offshore marine services 
revenues for certain vessels are earned in foreign currencies  primarily pounds sterling  and have been converted to us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the periods indicated 
operating and other expense drivers 
vessel operating expenses consist primarily of daily running costs and depreciation 
daily running costs  including such expenses as wages paid marine personnel  maintenance and repairs and insurance  vary depending on equipment type  location  and activity 
daily running costs may also include charter in expenses  a fixed cost  resulting from sale and leaseback transactions 
depreciation charges are also fixed and depend on the cost of acquisition and the company s useful life assumptions 
aggregate expenses for offshore marine services primarily depend on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
drydocking costs are expensed when incurred 
under applicable maritime regulations  vessels must be drydocked and surveyed by regulatory authorities twice in any given five year period or once in a two year period in the case of crew boats 
the company adheres to an asset management strategy of laying up vessels during periods of weak utilization 
drydocking and survey costs tend to decline when demand becomes slack  conversely  when business improves  drydocking activities and related costs tend to increase as vessels are returned to service 
should offshore marine services undertake a large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal year or put through survey a disproportionate number of older and or larger vessels  which typically have higher drydocking costs  comparative results may be affected 
for the years ended december    and  drydocking costs totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during those same periods  offshore marine services completed the drydocking of  and vessels  respectively 
the number of main propulsion engine overhauls performed in a period particularly affects engine repair expenses  which are also a significant component of offshore marine services vessel maintenance costs 
in recent years  offshore marine services has begun to replace older vessels with newer vessels that have more powerful main propulsion engines  which may result in higher repair expenses 
this altered fleet mix has occurred primarily through the introduction of new aluminum constructed fast support vessels  in which main propulsion engines significantly exceed the horsepower of older crew vessels sold from the fleet 
should engine repair expenses  particularly those related to main engine overhauls  increase in a fiscal year  comparative results may be affected 
for the fiscal years ended december   and main propulsion engine repair expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the company believes that the continuing worldwide threat of terrorist activity and past economic and political uncertainties have resulted in significant increases in its cost to insure against liability to other parties and damage to its vessels and other property and further increases in insurance costs are expected in for the fiscal years ended december   and  marine insurance expense totaled million  million and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company will be able to maintain its existing coverage or that it will not experience further substantial increases in insurance expense 
at december   offshore marine services had vessels bareboat chartered in pursuant to sale leaseback transactions that have been accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes 
income realized from the sale component of these transactions has been deferred to the extent of the present value of minimum lease payments and is being amortized to income as reductions in rental expense over the applicable lease terms 
charter in expense  net of deferred income amortization  resulting from sale leaseback transactions totaled million in  million in and million in market conditions the number of working offshore rigs peaked in march at approximately worldwide and declined to approximately rigs at year end  where it remained through year end the average working offshore rig count for was rigs 
the decline in offshore rig demand was greatest in the us gulf of mexico and north sea 
drilling activity has traditionally been linked to the cash flow of oil and gas companies  which is directly related to oil and natural gas commodity prices 
high oil and natural gas prices have historically been accompanied by more drilling activity  which increases the demand for services provided by offshore marine services 
the decline in rig demand since has tracked oil and natural gas commodity prices until recently 
although oil and natural gas prices increased during the second half of and remained at historically high levels in  this has yet to produce an increase in drilling activity 
vessels retired and out of service with continued weak demand and operating losses in its us gulf of mexico utility fleet  the company decided in the fourth quarter of to divest of this vessel type 
following this decision  the company profitably disposed of utility vessels and increased the size of its retired from service fleet from to utility vessels 
these vessels are being actively marketed for sale and have been removed from utilization statistics and fleet counts following their retirement from service 
the company s remaining fleet of utility vessels range in length from to feet  approximate to years of age and have an aggregate net book value of approximately million 
management expects to recover the remaining book value of the company s utility vessels upon their disposition 
nine crew  supply  mini supply and each of the anchor handling towing supply and geophysical classes were additionally out of service at year end due to weak customer demand for such equipment in the us gulf of mexico 
results of operations the results of operations for offshore marine services are presented in the following table for each year indicated 
in thousands amount amount amount revenues    operating expenses    administrative and general    depreciation and amortization    operating income    operating revenues 
operating revenues declined to million in and to million in and represented and  respectively of consolidated operating revenues 
the elements of changes in operating revenues included the effects of changes in in thousands amount amount utilization   rates per day worked   acquisitions   dispositions   foreign currency   other   declines in utilization and rates per day worked occurred principally in the company s us operations where vessel demand was lower resulting from a significant depression in rig utilization 
operating revenues earned in from fleet additions exceeded declines from fleet dispositions and the resulting modernization of offshore marine services fleet increased revenues 
in  the decline in operating revenues resulting from fleet dispositions exceeded the revenues earned from vessels added to the fleet during the year 
offshore marine services has for some years been pursuing a strategy to modernize its crew  supply and mini supply fleets 
during  several chartered in vessels were returned to their owners and others were divested 
functional currency pounds sterling rates per day worked earned by north sea standby safety vessels remained steady in and  however  a strengthening in both years in the pound sterling currency relative to the us dollar increased reported operating revenues by in each year 
because offshore marine services pays expenses associated with its north sea operations in pounds sterling  the strengthening of that currency relative to the us dollar did not have a material effect on overall operating income and net income of the company in or for financial statement reporting purposes  revenues and expenses associated with offshore marine services north sea operations are translated into us dollars at the weighted average currency exchange rates during the relevant period 
other operating revenues declined in each of and due primarily to additional vessels entering bareboat charter out service 
operating expenses 
operating expenses of offshore marine services increased in due to increases in wages paid to marine professionals 
regulatory docking expenses also rose 
a greater number of main engine overhauls  an increase in expenses resulting from major hull repairs to an anchor handling towing supply vessel and the replacement of certain diesel generator engines also contributed to higher vessel repair and maintenance expenses 
foreign shore based support expenses increased due to the relocation of offshore marine services nigerian office and increased wages for shore based support personnel 
expenses associated with expanded trinidadian vessel operations also increased 
additional sale and leaseback transactions resulted in increased charter in expense in operating expenses also increased in as a result of redundancy payments associated with workforce reductions due to fleet dispositions  escalating cost of insurance  and raises in compensation paid international seamen 
administrative and general 
administrative and general expenses increased in and due to employee termination benefit expenses 
fleet purchases also added administrative support expenses in depreciation and amortization 
the disposition of vessels pursuant to sale and leaseback transactions and the effect of certain vessels reaching the end of their depreciable lives lowered depreciation expense in amortization expense also declined in as the company ceased amortizing goodwill pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
net vessel dispositions and sale and leaseback transactions resulted in lower depreciation expense in environmental services general environmental services provides oil spill response  retainer  consulting and industrial and remediation services to tank vessel owner operators  refiners and terminal operators  exploration and production facility operators  pipeline operators  power generating operators  airports  and industrial companies 
with the exception of a major project completed in in support of operation iraqi freedom  most of the segment s operating revenues and profits are earned in the us operating revenue and expense drivers operating revenue drivers 
spill response operating revenues and related operating income are dependent on the number of spill responses in a given fiscal period and the magnitude of each spill 
consequently  spill response revenues and operating income can vary materially between comparable periods and the revenues from any one period is not indicative of a trend or of anticipated results in future periods 
costs of oil spill response activities primarily include payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials and or the direct charge of labor  equipment and materials provided by environmental services 
the margins on equipment intensive responses tend to be better than the margins on labor intensive responses 
the cost of equipment is largely fixed in relation to the capital investment whereas the cost of labor is variable 
further  labor costs can increase significantly when overtime payments are required as is typically the case with emergency responses that occur outside of normal business hours 
margins can also vary based on the use of environmental services own personnel and equipment resources versus the use of third party personnel and equipment 
environmental services charges a retainer fee for ensuring by contract the availability at predetermined rates of its response services and equipment 
retainer services include employing a staff to supervise response to an oil spill emergency and maintaining specialized equipment  including marine equipment  in a ready state for emergency and spill response as contemplated by response plans filed by its customers in accordance with opa and various state regulations 
environmental services maintains relationships with numerous environmental sub contractors to assist with response operations and equipment maintenance and provide trained personnel for deploying equipment in a spill response 
pursuant to retainer agreements entered into with environmental services  certain vessel owners pay in advance an annual retainer fee based upon the number and size of vessels in each such owner s fleet and in some circumstances pay additional fees based upon vessel voyage activity in the us certain vessel owners and facilities pay a fixed fee based upon volume of petroleum product transported for environmental services retainer services 
environmental services retainer agreements with vessel owners and facilities generally range from one to ten years 
retainer fees are generally recognized ratably throughout the year 
environmental services charges consulting fees to customers for customized training programs  its planning of and participation in customer oil spill response drill programs and response exercises and other special projects 
environmental services charges fees for its industrial and remediation services on both a time and material basis and on a fixed fee bid basis 
in both cases the total fees charged are dependent upon the scope of work to be accomplished and the labor and equipment to carry it out 
the margins on time and material services are more predictable and for the most part are larger 
as with emergency response work  the margins on equipment intensive jobs are better than labor intensive jobs 
bid jobs also carry the risk of underbidding the price in an effort to win the work so they must be managed very carefully to ensure profitability 
bid work that is bid and managed properly can result in higher margins than time and material work 
operating expense drivers 
the principal components of environmental services operating expenses are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to subcontractors  equipment maintenance and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer  spill  consulting and other environmental business activities 
results of operations the results of operations for environmental services are presented in the following table for each year indicated 
in thousands amount amount amount revenues    operating expenses    administrative and general    depreciation and amortization    operating income    operating revenues 
operating revenues decreased to million in as compared to increasing to million in and represented and  respectively  of consolidated operating revenues 
the decline in operating revenues in resulted primarily from the loss of certain customers retainer business  retainer service contract renegotiations with certain other customers and a decrease in the number and severity of managed oil spills 
the increase in operating revenues in resulted primarily from spill response  spill management  containment  and remediation services provided in iraq and the acquisition in the fourth quarter of an environmental services company serving the west coast of the us spill response activities represented approximately in and in of all environmental services operating revenues 
the company expects its newly acquired environmental services operation located on the west coast of the us will provide for the continued improvement in spill response activities and new sources of revenues not previously available to environmental services 
spill response revenues will nevertheless continue to be dependent on the number of spill responses and their magnitude in any given fiscal year 
consequently  spill response revenues may still vary materially between years and spill response revenues earned in any one year is not indicative of a trend or of anticipated results in future years 
operating expenses 
operating expenses declined in in response to reduced retainer activities 
higher operating costs in resulted from increased spill response  spill management  containment  and remediation services provided in iraq and the acquisition in the fourth quarter of an environmental services company serving the west coast of the us spill response operating expenses totaled million in and million in  representing and  respectively  of related operating revenues 
as with spill response operating revenues  spill response operating expenses can vary greatly between years due to the number and severity of the spill responses 
furthermore  spill response operating margin may also vary greatly between years and is dependent upon spill response contract pricing relative to the direct costs of labor  material and other resources engaged in spill projects 
in  the operating revenue and margin associated with operation iraqi freedom was relatively higher than most projects given the unusually high degree of logistical support and level of risk 
depreciation and amortization 
in both and  depreciation expense declined as a result of various assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives 
other business segment the company operates an inland river barge business in the us  and until the chiles merger on august   the company held an equity interest in chiles  which owned and operated ultra premium offshore jackup drilling rigs 
on december   the company completed its acquisition of tex air  a company that provides helicopter transportation services primarily to oil and gas companies operating in the us gulf of mexico 
inland river services inland river services earns operating revenues primarily from voyage contracts 
under these arrangements customers pay a price per ton to transport cargo for a specific point of origin load port to a specific destination discharge port 
customers are permitted a specified number of days to load and discharge the cargo  and thereafter pay a per diem rate for extra time 
from time to time  voyage contracts are entered into with the anticipation that the barge will be used for storage for a period of time prior to delivery 
such arrangements combine a per diem charge and a per ton payment for delivery 
inland river services also charters barges to other operators for various durations 
prices under such contracts are based on a rate per day 
dry cargo barge operating expenses are typically differentiated between those directly related to voyages and all other dry cargo barge operating costs 
voyage expenses primarily include towing  switching  fleeting and cleaning costs  non voyage related operating expenses include such costs as repairs  insurance and depreciation 
a majority of the dry cargo barges controlled by inland river services and certain dry cargo barges managed for third parties participate in pooling arrangements 
pursuant to these pooling arrangements  operating revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and the net results are allocated to participants based upon the number of days the dry cargo barges are in the pool 
over the past several years  the company has committed to expand inland river services primarily through the building and charter in of dry cargo barges  and further growth is expected principally through the continued purchase of new barges and possibly through the charter in and or acquisition of additional inland river transportation equipment 
at december   the company was committed to acquire new dry cargo barges and new tank barges 
additionally  the company holds options to purchase new dry cargo barges in the company expects inland river services will become a reportable business segment in the coming year as a result of improving operating revenues  profits and increasing asset values 
aviation services tex air derives the majority of its operating revenues from service contracts with major integrated and independent oil and gas producing companies 
the number and type of helicopters in tex air s fleet  the utilization of that fleet and the rates of hire tex air is able to obtain in the market primarily influence operating revenues 
rates and utilization are a function of demand for and availability of helicopters  which are closely aligned with the level of exploration  development and production in the us gulf of mexico 
the level of exploration  development and production is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices that  in turn  are related to the demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources 
at december   tex air s fleet consisted of helicopters  of which helicopters were committed for hire under customer contracts 
tex air took delivery of new eurocopter ec helicopters and new agusta a helicopters in the fourth quarter of and additionally acquired a used agusta a helicopter in the third quarter of the year 
aviation services also purchased a sikorsky s c in the fourth quarter of  subject to an operating lease that expires in at year end  aviation services was committed to purchase new agusta a helicopter  and following year end  committed to purchase additional new agusta a s 
operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the majority of tex air s operating expenses consist of wages and related benefits  insurance  repairs and maintenance and equipment leases 
other activities other activities primarily relate to the company s investment in globe wireless and in a handy max bulk carrier joint venture 
the company  from time to time  has made and may make investments in other related or unrelated businesses 
since its inception in the early s  globe wireless has focused on expanding its network of high frequency radio stations and its customer base 
to support its continued growth  globe wireless completed a private placement of equity in although globe wireless continues to experience negative cash flow  the company presently expects it can achieve operating cash break even without requiring additional capital funding from shareholders 
there can be no assurances that globe wireless future operations will be successful 
should globe wireless be unable to meet its funding requirements  seacor would be required to commit additional funding or record an impairment charge with respect to its investment 
at december   the carrying value of the company s investment in globe wireless was million 
the company consolidated the reporting of financial information of chiles  as a consequence of its majority ownership of chiles  from chiles inception in until the chiles ipo on september  because the company s ownership interest in chiles was reduced  the company began accounting for it using the equity method 
following the chiles merger in august  the company began accounting for the shares of ensco it acquired in the chiles merger as available for sale securities and now records changes in their market value each period as adjustments to other comprehensive income 
results of operations the results of operations for other are presented in the following table for each year indicated 
in thousands amount amount amount revenues    operating expenses    administrative and general   depreciation and amortization    operating income    operating revenues 
operating revenues increased to million in and to million in inland river services results improved to million in and to million in due primarily to the commencement of operation of new dry cargo barges in both years and the charter in of additional barges in the commencement of aviation services further increased other operating revenues by million in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million in and to million in operating expenses were higher in due to the commencement of operation of new dry cargo barges 
operating expenses declined as a percent of operating revenues in due to increased revenues resulting primarily from improved fleet utilization 
other operating expenses again increased in due to continued dry cargo fleet growth and commencement of aviation services and were higher as a percent of operating revenues 
start up and lease costs associated with chartered in dry cargo barges  higher barge towing expenses resulting from rising fuel costs  and the expense of placing new and existing helicopters into service increased operating expenses as a percent of operating revenues during the year 
administrative and general 
administrative and general expenses increased in both and in response to inland river services barge fleet growth and additionally increased with commencement of aviation services 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expenses increased in both and as a result of inland river services barge fleet growth and additionally increased with commencement of aviation services 
critical accounting policies general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  as discussed in its footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition 
offshore marine services earns and recognizes revenues primarily from the time and bareboat charter out of vessels to customers based upon daily rates of hire 
a time charter is a lease arrangement under which offshore marine services provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all crewing  insurance and other operating expenses 
in a bareboat charter  offshore marine services provides only the vessel to the customer  and the customer assumes responsibility to provide for all of the vessel s operating expenses and generally assumes all risk of operation 
vessel charters may range from several days to several years 
customers of environmental services are charged retainer fees for ensuring by contract the availability at predetermined rates of oil spill response services and equipment 
such retainer fees are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contract 
retainer services include employing a staff to supervise response to an oil spill and maintaining specialized equipment 
retainer agreements with vessel owners generally range from one to three years while retainer arrangements with facility owners are as long as ten years 
spill response revenues are recognized as the services are provided based on contract terms 
consulting fees are also earned from preparation of customized training programs  planning of and participation in customer oil spill response drill programs and response exercises and other special projects and are recognized as the services are provided based on contract terms 
environmental services charges fees for its industrial and remediation services on both a time and material basis and on a fixed fee bid basis 
in both cases the total fees charged are dependent upon the scope of work to be accomplished and the labor and equipment to carry it out 
inland river services earns operating revenues primarily from voyage contracts 
under these arrangements customers pay a price per ton to transport cargo for a specific point of origin load port to a specific destination discharge port 
in such arrangements customers are permitted a specified number of days to load and discharge the cargo  and thereafter pay a per diem rate to inland river services for extra time 
from time to time  voyage contracts are entered into with the anticipation that the barge will be used for storage for a period of time prior to delivery 
such arrangements combine a per diem charge and a per ton payment for delivery 
inland river services also charters barges to other operators for various durations 
prices under such contracts are based on a rate per day 
helicopters are chartered primarily through master service agreements  term contracts and day to day charter arrangements 
master service agreements require customers to make incremental payments based on usage  have fixed terms ranging from one month to five years and generally are cancelable upon notice by either party in days 
term contracts and day to day charter arrangements are generally non cancelable and call for a combination of a monthly or daily fixed rental fee plus a charge based on usage 
rental fee revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term and revenues for helicopter usage are recognized as the services are performed 
reserves for doubtful accounts receivable 
the company s reserves for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customers receivable balances 
in establishing reserves  the company assesses customer credit quality as well as other factors and trends  including the age of receivable balances 
individual credit assessments are performed regularly 
once the company completes its assessment of receivable balances due from customers  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
a reserve is established when the company views loss is likely 
the company s level of reserves can fluctuate depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
purchase accounting and goodwill 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of estimates and judgment to allocate the cost of an acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost of each acquired operation is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when  and if  information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition 
the cost of an enterprise acquired in a business combination includes the direct cost of the acquisition 
the operating results of entities acquired are included in the company s consolidated statements of income from the completion date of the applicable transaction 
in recording various business combinations  the company has assigned the excess of the cost of its acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed to goodwill  the balance of which totaled million  or of total assets  at december  in and prior years  the company amortized goodwill to expense over the expected benefit period  ranging from to years 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other changes to prior practices  the new standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occur between annual tests indicating that goodwill for a reporting unit might be impaired based on a fair value concept 
the company ceased amortization of its remaining goodwill balance effective january  the company s goodwill has primarily resulted from the acquisition of environmental and offshore marine businesses 
the company has performed its annual impairment test of goodwill based upon carrying values as of december  and has determined there was no goodwill impairment 
the implied fair values of the applicable reporting units were determined by employing comparable company and present value techniques to estimate the fair value of related groups net assets 
estimates used in discounted cash flow projections were consistent with the most recent budgets and plans used by management and incorporated consideration of industry trends 
there were many assumptions and estimates employed in determining the implied fair value of each reporting unit  including among other  the projection of vessels rates per day worked  vessels utilization  plans for vessel acquisitions and dispositions and operating expenses 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  variations from those estimates could produce materially different results 
fair value of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and except for those transactions that are effective hedges for accounting purposes in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  gains and losses are included in the determination of net income 
the derivative contracts recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheets are stated at their fair values  the determination of which the company acquired from third parties that regularly conduct business in the derivative contracts  which we have negotiated 
future adverse changes in the market price for the underlying amounts of the company s derivative contracts may result in losses in the company s statement of income or other comprehensive income 
investments in business ventures 
the company holds less than majority investments in  and has receivables from  strategically aligned companies that totaled million at december  the company employs the equity method of accounting for investments in business ventures when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the venture 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the company has between and of the voting rights of an investee 
the company may record investment impairment charges when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of an asset s carrying amount should be assessed might include i a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset and iii current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset 
if events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  the company would then be required to estimate the discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the asset  the company would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
cash flow estimates are based upon historical data adjusted to reflect the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on market trends 
the company s estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
self insurance liabilities 
the company maintains business insurance programs with significant self insured retention  primarily relating to its offshore support vessels 
in addition  the company maintains self insured health benefit plans for its participating employees 
the company limits its exposure to the business insurance programs and health benefit plans by maintaining stop loss and aggregate liability coverage 
self insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon the company s historical loss experience and valuations provided by independent third party consultants 
to the extent that estimated self insurance losses differ from actual losses realized  the company s insurance reserves could differ significantly and may result in either higher or lower insurance expense in future periods 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets totaling million resulting primarily from net operating loss carryforwards expiring in and foreign tax credit carryforwards expiring from through based on projections completed during the fourth quarter of  the company has determined that the foreign tax credits due to expire in and may not be utilized  resulting in a recorded valuation allowance of million 
the company believes that it will be able to utilize the remaining net foreign tax credit carryforwards through the turnaround of existing temporary differences  future earnings  tax strategies or a combination thereof 
also at december   the company had not provided for us income taxes  totaling million  with respect to million of undistributed earnings of certain non us subsidiaries and business ventures as it is the company s intention to indefinitely invest these earnings abroad 
should a remittance of undistributed earnings be expected in the foreseeable future  the company would then be required to provide for the related us income tax consequences 
vessel depreciation 
the company depreciates its vessels over to years from date of original construction  except for standby safety vessels where it has chosen a useful life of years 
in assigning depreciable lives to its vessels  the company has considered the effects of both physical deterioration largely caused by wear and tear due to operating use and other factors that could impact commercial viability 
typical equipment is depreciated to a salvage value  which ranges from to of acquisition cost 
to date  the company s experience confirms that these policies are reasonable  although  there may be events in the future that cause it to change these estimates 
the effect of a change in an accounting estimate would be reported in the period of change and future periods if the change affects both 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of working capital needs  acquisition  construction or improvement of equipment  repayment of debt obligations  repurchase of common stock and purchase of other investments 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash balances  marketable securities  construction reserve funds  cash flows from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility although  from time to time  it may issue debt  shares of common stock  preferred stock  or a combination thereof  or sell vessels and other assets to finance the acquisition of equipment and businesses or make improvements to existing equipment 
the company s operating cash flow levels are determined by the size of the fleet  rates per day worked and overall utilization of offshore marine services vessels and the activities of environmental services  inland river services and aviation services 
operating activities the company s cash flows from operating activities declined to million in and to million in a significant curtailment of drilling activity  particularly in the us gulf of mexico following march  has adversely affected demand and rates per day worked for most vessel types in offshore marine services us fleet 
as a result  offshore marine services profits have declined dramatically along with related cash flows provided from operations 
although oil and natural gas prices improved in  there has been no increase in us gulf of mexico drilling activity 
the company cannot predict whether  or to what extent  market conditions will improve  remain stable or deteriorate 
should present demand and rates per day worked for offshore marine services vessels remain unchanged or further decline  results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected 
offshore marine services net fleet dispositions have also lowered cash flows provided by operating activities in the size of offshore marine services fleet has declined from vessels at december  to vessels at december  as a result of the company s strategy of reducing its overall exposure to the broad cycles of the energy business 
reduced cash flows provided by operating activities in offshore marine services were partly offset by improved results in inland river services and environmental services 
profits improved in inland river services in both and due primarily to fleet expansion 
environmental services profits rose in resulting from increased spill response activities 
over the past several years  the company has committed to expand inland river services primarily through the building and charter in of dry cargo barges  and further growth is planned through the continued purchase of new barges and possibly through the charter in and or acquisition of additional inland river transportation equipment 
consequently  operating profits and cash flows provided by inland river services are expected to improve in future years 
spill response profits and related cash flows from operations continue to be dependent upon the number of spill responses in a given fiscal year and the magnitude of each spill 
consequently  cash flows provided by operations that result from spill response activities can vary greatly between years and the results of one year is not indicative of a trend or of anticipated cash flows from future years 
during december  the company expanded into aviation services through the acquisition of tex air 
in  aviation services incurred a slight operating loss and negative cash flow from operations 
aviation services is subject to the same broad cycles of the energy industry as is offshore marine services 
although the company cannot predict whether  or to what extent  market conditions will improve  remain stable or deteriorate  the company does believe aviation services operating results and cash flows will improve in the coming year 
investing activities historically  the company has made significant capital expenditures to acquire vessels for offshore marine services 
although the company is presently pursuing a strategy to reduce its overall exposure in this industry  it will continue to make future capital expenditures that will maximize the overall utility and flexibility of offshore marine services fleet 
with its recent entry into inland river services and aviation services  the company is committed to expanding these businesses with the acquisition of barges and related inland river transportation equipment and helicopters 
capital expenditures increased to million in and to million in the company acquired vessels and barges in ten vessels  barges and helicopters  including previously leased by the company  were additionally acquired in of the equipment purchased in both years  vessels  all barges and helicopters were new equipment 
cash flows from the sale of equipment  principally vessels  increased to million in and to million in the company sold vessels in  including pursuant to sale and leaseback transactions 
an additional vessels were sold in  including pursuant to sale and leaseback transactions and utility vessels  a type that has been retired from service and is being actively marketed for sale 
with the company s strategy of reducing its overall exposure in the energy business  it will continue to sell selected offshore support vessels to maximize the overall utility and flexibility of its offshore marine services fleet 
for many years  the company has maintained construction reserve funds with the us maritime administration that were established pursuant to section of the merchant marine act   as amended 
in accordance with this statute  the company has been permitted to deposit vessel sale proceeds into construction reserve fund accounts for purposes of acquiring new us flag vessels and thereby qualifying for temporary deferral of taxable gains realized from sale of vessels 
these accounts are controlled jointly by the company and the us maritime administration 
from date of deposit  withdrawals from the jointly controlled construction reserve fund accounts are subject to prior written approval of the us maritime administration  and the funds on deposit must be committed for expenditure within three years or be released for the company s general use 
in prior years  the company has used these funds to acquire vessels  but it expects to use some of the funds in the future for the acquisition of barges 
any such gains from vessel sales previously deferred would become immediately taxable upon release to the company of sale proceeds that were deposited into jointly controlled construction reserve fund accounts 
at december   the company held million in construction reserve funds 
at december  the company was committed to purchase new vessels  new dry cargo barges  new tank barges  and new helicopter at an aggregate cost of million 
deliveries are expected over the next months 
also at december   the company held options to purchase an additional new dry cargo barges 
following year end  vessels previously under construction were delivered  and the company committed to the construction of additional helicopters 
cash used in corporate acquisition transactions declined to million in but increased to million in significant corporate acquisitions in that added vessels to offshore marine services fleet did not recur in the following year 
corporate acquisitions in primarily related to the purchase of foss environmental services company 
investing activities with offshore marine services joint ventures and the net results of marketable securities sale purchase transactions provided cash flows in both and the company received million during in connection with the chiles merger 
cash was set aside in construction reserve funds during both and for the purchase of vessels or barges 
stock and debt repurchase activity seacor s stock and debt repurchase plan  approved by the board of directors  allows the company to acquire common stock  its notes that were completely retired in  its senior notes due october the notes  and its notes collectively  seacor securities 
in  and  a total of   and  shares of common stock  respectively  were acquired for treasury at an aggregate cost of million  million and million  respectively 
also during  the company purchased million principal amount of its notes and million principal amount of its notes for million 
during  seacor s board of directors increased its previously announced repurchase authority and  at march   million of such authority remains available for future purchases of seacor securities that may be conducted from time to time through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  depending on market conditions 
financial position and capital resources financial position 
total assets of the company grew by to billion in but declined to billion in the company s combined cash  marketable securities and construction reserve funds declined to million in and represented of total assets at year end 
debt repayment and the repurchase of stock for treasury particularly lowered the company s cash balances in net property and equipment remained constant between and at million and represented of total assets at year end 
financing 
the company generally borrows on a long term basis 
debt obligations at december  totaled million as compared to million at december  and declined between years 
the company s outstanding debt at december  principally included its notes due in and its notes due in debt obligations increased in with the company s sale of million aggregate principal amount of its notes 
in  the company reduced the amount of its debt obligations principally with repayment of amounts owing under its notes  notes and notes due former stockholders of an acquired company 
through the sale of its notes and repayment of various other outstanding debts in and  the company increased the average life of its funded debt obligations  extending the dates on which principal repayment obligations fall due 
additionally  the recent retirement of all of its convertible debt eliminated the possibility that the company would have to issue additional shares of common stock under these instruments 
the company has million available for use under a five year  non reducing  unsecured revolving credit facility that terminates in february advances under the revolving credit facility are available for general corporate purposes 
interest on advances will be charged at a rate per annum of libor plus an applicable margin of to basis points based upon the company s credit rating as determined by standard poor s and moody s 
the only consequence of a change in the company s credit rating would be adjustments to the applicable margin 
the company is not required to maintain a credit rating under the terms of the facility agreement  and if the company does not maintain a credit rating  the applicable margin would be determined by financial ratios 
the revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants regarding interest coverage  secured debt to total capitalization  funded debt to total capitalization ratios and the maintenance of a minimum level of consolidated net worth  as well as other customary covenants  representations and warranties  funding conditions and events of default 
the revolving credit facility contains no repayment triggers 
the company s access to its revolving credit facility requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants  one of which is an interest coverage ratio 
the company has recently experienced declines in results of operations and  if results of operations continue at the level of the fourth quarter of or decline further  the company may fail to meet this requirement of the revolving credit facility and  accordingly  may not have access to it or it may be terminated 
should this occur  the company believes it has ample liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under the facility  million as of december   and to meet its foreseeable operating and capital expenditure commitments  including its ability to continue its share repurchase program 
the company uses major capital markets and bank financing to meet certain of its financing requirements 
the company has not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt 
short and long term liquidity requirements the company anticipates it will generate positive cash flows from operations in the coming year and these cash flows will be adequate to meet the company s working capital requirements and contribute toward defraying the costs of next year s capital expenditures 
as in the past and in further support of the company s capital expenditure program  the company intends to sell vessels  enter into sale and leaseback transactions for vessels  or utilize construction reserve funds  or a combination thereof 
to the extent the company relies on existing cash balances  proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities or construction reserve funds  the company s liquidity would be reduced 
the company s long term liquidity is dependent upon its ability to generate operating profits  which are sufficient to meet its requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and a reasonable return on shareholders investment 
the company believes that earning such operating profits will permit it to maintain its access to favorably priced debt  equity and or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
with the cyclical nature of the energy business and the recent adverse effect it has had on the company s results of operations and cash flows  the company has adopted a strategy of reducing its overall dependency on this industry and reinvesting certain of its capital resources in inland river services 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company guaranteed up to million with respect to amounts owing pursuant to a vessel charter agreement between the company s mexican joint venture and the owner of the chartered vessels 
the company s guarantee declines over the life of the charter and terminates in at december   the company guaranteed up to million with respect to amounts owing pursuant to a vessel charter agreement between a us joint venture entity in which the company owns a interest and the owner of the chartered vessel 
the company s guarantee declines over the life of the charter and terminates in at december   the company guaranteed up to million with respect to amounts owed by pelican under a banking facility  which becomes due in contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments and their aggregate maturities as of december   in thousands of dollars 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt   operating leases      purchase obligations   total contractual obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period total less than after other commercial commitments committed year years years years joint venture charter guarantees      joint venture note guarantee 
  letters of credit   total commercial commitments 
     primarily resulted from leases of vessels  helicopters and barges 
following year end  the company committed to the construction of helicopters for aggregate consideration of million 
guarantee for non payment of amounts owing under joint venture charter agreements with respect to vessels 
guarantee of amounts owed by pelican under its banking facilities 
effects of inflation the company s operations expose it to the effects of inflation 
although the company does not consider the effects of inflation to be material to its operating revenues or income from continuing operations  in the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the world economy  inflationary pressures could result in increased operating and financing costs 
contingencies in connection with an examination of the company s income tax return for fiscal year  the internal revenue service irs has indicated that it may assert a deficiency in the amount of taxes paid based on the manner in which vessel assets were classified for the purpose of depreciation 
if the irs were able to sustain its position  the company would be required to pay currently certain amounts  which have not yet been determined  that are currently reported as long term deferred tax obligations 
other than a potential charge for interest related to any such deficiencies  the final resolution of this matter should not have an effect on the company s results of operations 
the company intends to vigorously defend its position and to contest any deficiency that may be asserted 
cautionary statements certain statements discussed item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and elsewhere in this form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause the actual results  performance or achievements of results to differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and other important factors include  among others offshore marine services and aviation services are subject to cyclicality and a significant or prolonged decline in oil and gas prices would likely reduce the level of exploration and development of offshore areas  which would reduce demand for the company s vessels and helicopters 
the offshore oil and gas industry is highly cyclical 
activity in the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry has a significant impact on offshore marine services and aviation services 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile and  as a result  the level of offshore exploration and drilling activity also has been extremely volatile 
reductions in oil and gas prices generally result in decreased drilling and production and corresponding decreases in demand for the company s vessels  logistics services and helicopters 
offshore marine services relies on several customers for a significant share of its revenues  the loss of which could adversely affect offshore marine services business and operating results 
offshore marine services customers are primarily major oil companies  large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies 
the portion of offshore marine services revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by the customer  offshore marine services ability to meet the customer s needs and other factors  many of which are beyond offshore marine services control 
the company may incur significant costs  liabilities and penalties in complying with government regulations 
government regulation  such as international conventions  federal  state and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where the company operates have a significant impact on the company s business 
these regulations relate to worker health and safety  the manning  construction and operation of vessels  oil spills and other aspects of the company s business 
risks of incurring substantial compliance costs and liabilities and penalties for non compliance  particularly with respect to environmental laws and regulations  are inherent in the company s business 
the company cannot predict whether it will incur such costs or penalties in the future 
offshore marine services faces intense competition that could adversely affect its ability to increase its market share and revenues 
offshore marine services operates in a highly competitive industry 
high levels of competition could reduce its operating revenues  increase its expenses and reduce its profitability 
in addition to price  service and reputation  important competitive factors for offshore fleets of vessels include customer flag preferences  local marine operating conditions and intended use of vessels 
other principal competitive factors include the ability to maintain logistical support given the complexity of a project and presence of equipment in the appropriate geographical locations 
an increase in the supply of offshore support vessels would likely have an adverse impact on the charter rates earned by the company s offshore support vessels 
expansion of the worldwide offshore support vessel fleet would increase competition in the markets where offshore marine services operates 
the refurbishment of disused or mothballed vessels  conversion of vessels from uses other than oil support and related activities or construction of new vessels could all add vessel capacity to current worldwide levels 
a significant increase in vessel capacity would lower charter rates 
vessel and helicopter related risks could disrupt offshore marine services and aviation services and expose the company to liability 
the operation of offshore support vessels and helicopters is subject to various risks  including catastrophic disaster  adverse weather  mechanical failure and collision  and risks with respect to vessels additionally include sea conditions  capsizing  grounding  oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors 
these risks could endanger the safety of the company s personnel  equipment  cargo and other property  as well as the environment 
if any of these events were to occur  the company could be held liable for resulting damages 
in addition  the affected vessels or helicopters could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenues 
aviation services may be subject to adverse weather conditions and seasonality 
three types of weather related and seasonal occurrences impact aviation services  poor weather conditions generally  tropical storm season in the us gulf of mexico  and the number of hours of daylight 
poor visibility  high winds  and heavy precipitation can affect the operation of helicopters and result in reduced number of flight hours 
in the us gulf of mexico  the months of december through february have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year and june through november is tropical storm season 
during tropical storms  aviation services is unable to operate in the area of the storm although flight activity may increase due to the evacuation of offshore workers 
in addition  aviation services facilities are located along the us gulf of mexico coast and tropical storms may cause damage to its property 
the fall and winter months have fewer hours of daylight 
consequently  flight hours are generally lower at these times 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from aviation services is dependent on actual flight hours and prolonged periods of adverse weather and the effect of fewer hours of daylight can adversely impact aviation services 
the company s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect the company from the liabilities that could arise in its businesses 
the company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its businesses 
there can be no assurance  however  that its existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  the company could be exposed to substantial liability 
the company s global operations are subject to currency exchange risks 
to minimize the financial impact of currency fluctuations and risks arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the company attempts to contract the majority of its services in us dollars 
however  in some of its foreign businesses  the company collects revenues and pays expenses in local currency 
if the value of foreign currencies in particular the value of the pound sterling  the currency in the united kingdom where most of the company s currency exchange risk arises decline against the us dollar and the company does not or is not able to minimize the effects of such fluctuations through currency hedging arrangements  the company s operating results may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not incur losses in the future as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because a significant proportion of offshore marine services operations are conducted in foreign countries  unstable political  military and economic conditions in those countries could adversely impact the company s business 
during  approximately of the company s revenues  principally resulting from offshore marine services activities  were derived from foreign operations 
these operations are subject to risks  among other things  of political instability  potential vessel seizure  terrorist attacks  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
economic sanctions or an oil embargo  for example  could have a significant negative impact on activity in the oil and gas industry and correspondingly on the company should it operate vessels in the region of the embargo 
in addition  the company s vessel operations in mexico are significantly affected by mexican government policy 
the company cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future 
the company may be unable to maintain or replace its vessels as they age 
as of december   the average age of offshore support vessels the company owned  excluding its standby safety vessels  was approximately years 
the company believes that after an offshore support vessel has been in service for approximately years  the expense which typically increases with age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels  or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels 
spill response revenue is dependent upon the magnitude and number of spill responses 
environmental services spill response revenue can vary greatly between comparable years based on the number and magnitude of spill responses in any given year 
as a result  environmental services revenues and profitability may vary greatly from year to year 
a relaxation of oil spill regulation or enforcement could reduce demand for environmental services services 
environmental services is dependent upon the enforcement of regulations promulgated under opa and  to a lesser extent  upon state regulations 
less stringent oil spill regulations or less aggressive enforcement of these regulations would decrease demand for environmental services services 
there can be no assurance that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent 
if this happens  the demand for environmental services oil spill response services could be reduced 
a change in  or revocation of  nrc s classification as an oil spill removal organization would result in a loss of business 
nrc is classified as an osro 
osro classification is a voluntary process conducted by the coast guard 
the coast guard classifies osros based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills in different operating environments  such as rivers canals  inland waters and oceans 
coast guard classified osros have a competitive advantage over non classified service providers 
customers of a classified osro are exempt from regulations that would otherwise require them to list their oil spill response resources in filings with the coast guard 
a loss of nrc s classification or changes in the requirements could eliminate or diminish nrc s ability to provide customers with this exemption 
if this happens  environmental services could lose customers 
environmental services could incur liability in connection with providing spill response services 
although environmental services is generally exempt from liability under the federal clean water act for its own actions and omissions in providing spill response services  this exemption would not apply if it was found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct  or if it fails to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the clean water act 
in addition  the exemption under the federal clean water act would not protect environmental services against liability for personal injury or wrongful death  or against prosecution under other federal or state laws 
while most of the us states in which environmental services provides service have adopted similar exemptions  several states have not 
if a court or other applicable authority determines that environmental services does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing spill response services  environmental services could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages  including damages caused by others 
if the company does not restrict the amount of foreign ownership of its common stock  the company could be prohibited from operating its offshore support vessels in parts of the us  which would adversely impact its business and operating results 
the company is subject to the shipping acts  which govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of offshore support vessels used to carry cargo between us ports 
the acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the us although the company s certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the shipping acts  the company would be prohibited from operating its offshore support vessels in the us coastwise trade during any period in which the company did not comply with these regulations 
inland river services could experience significant variability in freight rates 
freight transportation rates may fluctuate from season to season and year to year 
demand for transportation of dry cargo on the inland waterways varies due to numerous factors  including global economic conditions and business cycles  domestic agricultural production demand as well as international agricultural production demand and the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
in addition  the number of barges in the overall industry fleet available to transport these cargoes varies from year to year as older barges are retired and scrapped and new barges are constructed and placed into service 
the resulting relationship between available cargoes and available barges varies with periods of low barge availability and high cargo demand causing higher freight rates and periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand causing lower freight rates 
significant periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services operations are affected by the level of grain exports 
inland river services business is significantly affected by the level of grain export volume handled through us gulf of mexico ports 
grain exports can vary due to  among other things  crop harvest yield levels in the us and abroad 
overseas grain shortages can increase demand for us grain  while worldwide over production can decrease the demand for us grain 
this variable nature of grain exports can result in temporary barge oversupply  which can drive down freight rates 
there can be no assurance that historical levels of grain export volume will be maintained in the future and  to the extent supply imbalances were to prevail for a significant period of time  they could have an adverse impact on inland river services 
inland river services operations are affected by international economic and political factors 
inland river services may be affected by actions of foreign governments and global or regional economic developments 
for example  global economic events such as foreign import export policy or currency fluctuations  could affect the level of imports and exports 
foreign agricultural subsidies can also impact demand for us agricultural exports 
in addition  foreign trade agreements and each country s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for us imports and exports 
national and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or us imports and or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates will affect the demand for transportation of cargo on the inland waterways 
changes in the value of the u 
s 
dollar relative to other currencies will raise or lower demand for us exports as well as us demand for foreign produced raw materials and finished good imports 
such actions or developments could have an adverse impact on inland river services 
inland river services operations are affected by seasonality in activity 
inland river services business is seasonal  and its quarterly operating revenues and operating profits historically have been lower during the first and second fiscal quarters of the year january through june and higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters july through december due to the grain harvest 
inland river services operations are affected by risks of adverse weather and river conditions 
inland river services operations are affected by weather and river conditions 
varying weather patterns can affect river levels and cause ice in northern us river areas 
for example  the upper mississippi river closes annually from approximately mid december to mid march and ice conditions can hamper navigation on the upper reaches of the illinois river during the winter months 
in addition  adverse river conditions affect towboat speed  tow size and loading drafts and can delay barge movements 
lock outages due to lock maintenance and or other interruptions in normal lock operation can also delay barge movements 
it is likely that adverse weather or river conditions in the future could adversely impact inland river services operations 
inland river services operations are affected by fuel price fluctuations 
fuel prices are subject to fluctuation as a result of domestic and international events 
while the company does not currently operate towboats or fleeting operations  instead purchasing these services from third party vendors  it is indirectly exposed to increases in fuel prices  as vendors will adjust the price of the services when fuel prices escalate 
thus  there can be no assurance that inland river services will not experience pressure from increased fuel prices in the future  which could adversely impact inland river services business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has foreign currency exchange risks primarily related to its vessel operations that are conducted from ports located in the united kingdom where its functional currency is pounds sterling 
net consolidated assets of pound million  before translation to us dollars  are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  in addition  seacor has provided cash advances to these operations of million  or pound million  as of december  seacor considers these advances to be intercompany loans with payment expected in the foreseeable future 
a weakening in the exchange rate of the pound sterling against the us dollar as of december  would reduce other comprehensive income by approximately million  net of tax  due to translation and would reduce income by approximately million  net of tax  due to foreign currency losses on the revaluing of intercompany advance transactions 
at december   the company held available for sale securities with a fair value of million  including million in fixed income investments and million in equity securities 
the fixed income investments had remaining maturities of years or less 
from time to time  the company may increase its level of investment in fixed income securities that have included us government bonds  uk government bonds  state and municipal bonds  and corporate notes with maturities ranging from a few months to many years 
the fair value of such investments fluctuates based on the general level of interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities 
when making substantial investments in fixed income securities  the company manages its risk associated with these investments by maintaining a ladder of maturities and analyzing the creditworthiness of issuers 
the company s equity securities primarily include positions in energy  marine  and other related businesses  including a significant position in ensco 
the company monitors its investments in available for sale securities on a regular basis and disposes of investments when it judges the risk profile to be too high or when it believes that the investments have reached an attractive valuation 
a decline in the value of available for sale securities as of december  would reduce other comprehensive income by million  net of tax 
in order to partially hedge the fluctuation in market value for part of the company s common stock position in ensco that resulted from the chiles merger  the company entered into various transactions commonly known as costless collars during with a major financial institution on  shares of ensco common stock 
the costless collar transactions were terminated in the second quarter of with neither party having a payment obligation under these transactions 
at december   the company held positions in short sales of marketable equity securities with a fair value of million 
the company s short sales of marketable equity securities primarily include positions in energy  marine  and other related businesses 
a increase in the value of equity securities underlying the short sale positions of the company as of december  would reduce income and other comprehensive income by million  net of tax 
the company s debt is primarily in fixed interest rate instruments 
while the fair value of these debt instruments will vary with changes in interest rates  the company has fixed most of its cash flow requirements and operations are not significantly affected by interest rate fluctuations 
the company s only significant variable rate debt instrument is its revolving credit facility  under which the company had no outstanding borrowings at december  while available for liquidity requirements  the company has not historically utilized significant portions of the revolving credit facility for any extended period of time and thus has not been significantly impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
in order to reduce its cost of capital  the company entered into swap agreements during the fourth quarter of and second quarter of with a major financial institution with respect to million of its notes 
pursuant to each such agreement  such financial institution agreed to pay to the company an amount equal to interest paid on the notional amount of the notes subject to such agreement  and the company agreed to pay to such financial institution an amount equal to the london interbank offered rate plus a margin of basis points on the agreed upon price of such notional amount of the notes as set forth in the applicable swap agreement 
during fourth quarter of  the company terminated the swap agreements and the financial institution paid the company million  representing the amount by which the fair market value of the notional amount of the notes subject to such swap agreements on such date exceeded the agreed upon price of such notional amount as set forth in such swap agreements 
the company has entered into forward exchange and futures contracts that are considered speculative with respect to norwegian kroners  pounds sterling  euros  japanese yen  singapore dollars and hong kong dollars 
the norwegian kroner contracts enabled the company to buy norwegian kroners in the future at fixed exchange rates  which could have offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange had the company conducted business in norway 
the pound sterling  euro yen  singapore dollar and hong kong dollar contracts enable the company to buy pounds sterling  euros  yen  singapore dollars and hong kong dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates  which could offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange of the company s business conducted in europe and the far east

the company has entered into and settled various positions in natural gas and crude oil via swaps  options and futures contracts pursuant to which  on each applicable settlement date  the company receives or pays an amount  if any  by which a contract price for a swap  an option or a futures contract exceeds the settlement price quoted on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or receives or pays the amount  if any  by which the settlement price quoted on the nymex exceeds the contract price 
the general purpose of these hedge transactions is to provide value to the company should the price of natural gas and crude oil decline  which over time  if sustained  would lead to a decline in the company s offshore assets market values and cash flows 
as of december   the company s positions relating to these commodities were not significant 
the company has entered into and settled various positions in us treasury notes and bonds via futures or options on futures and rate lock agreements on us treasury notes pursuant to which  on each applicable settlement date  the company receives or pays an amount  if any  by which a contract price for an option or a futures contract exceeds the settlement price quoted on the chicago board of trade cbot or receives or pays the amount  if any  by which the settlement price quoted on the cbot exceeds the contract price
