item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of encore acquisition company should be read in conjunction with the historical financial information provided in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  as well as the business and properties descriptions in items and of this report 
overview we engage in the acquisition  development  exploitation and production of onshore north american oil and natural gas reserves 
we remain determined to execute our business strategy of maintaining an active low risk development drilling program  maximizing existing reserves and production through high pressure air injection projects  expanding our reserves and production through a disciplined acquisition program  and cost control through efficient and safe operations 
our financial results and ability to generate cash depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and natural gas 
oil prices remained strong in the average oil price for the nymex futures market was and per barrel for and  respectively 
the average natural gas price for the nymex futures market was and per mmbtu for and  respectively 
commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
it is very difficult for us to predict future commodity prices 
for this reason  we attempt to mitigate the effect of commodity price risk by hedging 
in  we were able to expand our mid continent area by acquiring a non operated interest in natural gas properties in north louisiana 
we are optimistic both about how well this particular asset  elm grove  fits in our portfolio  and by the possibilities of additional acquisitions in the region 
elm grove complements our existing asset base in many ways 
we believe it contains a solid  predictable production base along with a large number of low risk infill drilling opportunities that are currently being exploited 
also in  we continued to see positive results from our initial high pressure air injection project at our pennel unit of the cca  and have approved expanding it to other areas in the cca 
we began phase one of our second hpai project in little beaver during december and phase one and phase two 
table of contents should be completed during our independent reserve engineers  miller and lents  ltd  booked million barrels of proved undeveloped oil reserves associated with high pressure air at year end related to the little beaver unit project 
high pressure air injection contributed to our fd a cost of per boe during for the long term  we believe that high pressure air injection technology can be applied throughout the cedar creek anticline 
highlights our financial and operating results for the year ended december  included the following highlights oil and natural gas reserves increased to  mboe 
during  we added mmboe at a fd a cost of per boe  replacing of the mmboe produced in including revisions  the development program added mmboe of our production at a cost of per boe 
included in our reserve additions are mmboe of high pressure air volumes 
the mmboe represents the first reserves related to our high pressure air injection program in the cedar creek anticline of montana and north dakota 
our three year fd a costs  including revisions  are per boe with a reserve replacement ratio of 
oil reserves accounted for of total proved reserves  and of proved reserves are proved developed 
our reserve to production ratio is years for total proved reserves and years for proved developed reserves 
production volumes for the year increased to mmboe  boe per day  compared with production of mmboe  boe per day 
oil represented and of our total boe production in and  respectively 
the increase in production is due to our continued successful development and exploitation program as well as the elm grove acquisition 
net income for the full year of increased to million  or per diluted share  on revenues of million 
net income for the year ended december  includes a million per diluted share cumulative effect of accounting change resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  this compares to full year net income of million  or per diluted share  on revenues of million 
for  cash flow from operations increased to million from million for the increase in net income and cash flow from operations from was primarily a result of higher production and higher commodity prices throughout the year 
we improved our financial flexibility and liquidity by negotiating an increased borrowing base under the existing credit facility from million to million 
at december   we had million outstanding on the borrowing base and million available for funding of future capital requirements 
we improved our ability to access capital markets with the filing of a million universal shelf registration statement on form s we currently have million availability remaining under the registration statement 
we expanded the liquidity and public ownership of our common stock by facilitating the sale of common stock by jp morgan and warburg pincus 
on november   we priced a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the underwriters also exercised their over allotment option for an additional million shares of common stock  at a price of per share  on december   for a total of million shares 
we used all of the net proceeds to repurchase  shares of our common stock from jp morgan and  shares from warburg pincus at a price of per share 
the million shares we purchased were retired upon repurchase 
our total shares outstanding did not change as a result of this offering 
net proceeds from the original offering and the over allotment option totaled approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses of the offering 
after giving effect to the repurchase  jp morgan 
table of contents no longer beneficially owns any of our common stock and warburg pincus beneficially owns of our common stock 
high pressure air injection was implemented in a second area on the cca properties in the little beaver area 
we were able to negotiate the purchase of high pressure air compression services from an offset operator 
this allowed us to implement a project in little beaver unit  on the south end of the cedar creek anticline  in less than one year 
first injection began in little beaver phase one during december and phase one and phase two should be completed during our independent reserve engineers  miller and lents  ltd  booked million barrels of oil reserves associated with high pressure air at year end at little beaver 
high pressure air injection contributed to our fd a cost during results of operations comparison of to set forth below is our comparison of operations during the year ended december  with the year ended december  revenues and production 
for the year ended december   revenues increased million 
the following table illustrates the primary components of oil and natural gas revenue for the years ended december  and  as well as each year s respective oil and natural gas volumes dollars in thousands except per unit amounts year ended december  difference revenue unit revenue unit revenue unit revenues oil wellhead oil hedges total oil revenues natural gas wellhead natural gas hedges total natural gas revenues combined wellhead combined hedges total combined revenues average average average nymex nymex nymex production unit production unit production unit other data oil mbbls natural gas mmcf combined mboe oil revenues increased million in over as production increased mbbls and our average realized price increased per bbl 
the increase in production resulted from our successful development drilling program and uplift from the hpai program 
oil revenues were reduced by million in due to our hedging program 
the hedging per bbl reduction to our wellhead oil price of represented a per bbl greater reduction than in this compares favorably with the 
table of contents increase in the average nymex price from to as we were able to realize additional upside due to a higher average ceiling on our hedges compared to nymex than in in addition  our oil wellhead revenue was reduced by million and million in and  respectively  for the net profits interests payments made to others related to our cca properties 
natural gas revenues increased in by million due to a increase in the net wellhead price received along with increased production of mmcf 
the increase in net wellhead price received of per mcf resulted as the average nymex price increased per mcf over the same period 
the natural gas production increase resulted from the elm grove acquisition during averaging  mcfe per day since its acquisition on july   the elm grove properties added  mcfe per day to our average daily production for the full year 
for  we anticipate increased production related to our budgeted million capital drilling program and million in hpai projects 
we also have an additional million budgeted for leasehold and other general capital expenditures 
the total capital budget for is million 
prices received for oil and natural gas production are largely based on current market prices  which are beyond our control 
we have based our forecasts on the assumptions of per bbl and per mcf nymex prices 
for comparability and accountability  we take a constant approach to budgeting commodity prices 
we presently analyze our inventory of capital projects on per bbl and per mcf nymex prices to ensure a good rate of return to our shareholders without the benefit of escalating future commodity prices 
if nymex prices trend downward below our base deck  we may reevaluate our capital projects 
at these assumed prices  we have forecasted net hedge contract payments of approximately million for oil and net receipts of million for natural gas 
however  these amounts will change directly with any change in the market price of oil and natural gas and with any change in our outstanding hedge positions 
additionally  we have anticipated net profits interests payments of million for oil and million for natural gas 
these payments are highly dependent on the level of drilling in the cca and commodity prices  and thus  any change in the level of drilling or market fluctuation in commodity prices will have a direct impact on the amount of payments we are required to make 
if commodity prices are significantly lower than our forecasted prices of for oil and for natural gas  we will not have sufficient internally generated cash flow to fund the budgeted million drilling program  million in hpai projects  and million leasehold and other capital for in this case  we would have to borrow money under our existing revolving credit facility  seek capital markets  or curtail the capital program 
if drilling is curtailed or ended  future cash flows could be materially negatively impacted 
lease operations expense 
lease operations expense for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to the increase in total lease operations expense resulted from the increase in volumes as a result of our drilling program  the elm grove acquisition and hpai program 
see revenues and production above 
on a per boe basis  lease operations expense increased primarily due to full year results of our paradox basin properties  which had higher average per boe lease operations expense of for compared to our average of per boe  the hpai project on the cca properties  and lower production volumes from our lodgepole properties  which have low operating costs 
for  we anticipate an increase in total lease operations expense  as well as on a per boe basis 
we anticipate this increase due to a full year of production at our north louisiana properties  as well as further implementation of the high pressure air injection program 
also  the continued production decline of our lodgepole properties  which have low per boe operating costs  will continue to raise our lease operations expense on a per boe basis 
we have projected total lease operations expenses of approximately million  or per boe  for production  ad valorem  and severance taxes 
production  ad valorem  and severance taxes for the year ended december  increased as compared to by approximately million 
the increase is a direct result of the increase in wellhead revenue 
see revenues and production above 
as a 
table of contents percentage of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of net profits and hedges  production  ad valorem  and severance taxes increased slightly from to from to for  total production  ad valorem  and severance taxes will depend in a large part on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
however  the production  ad valorem  and severance tax rate should remain relatively constant at an estimated of wellhead revenues 
however  if nymex prices continue to stay above per barrel  we will temporarily lose production and severance tax incentives in montana and north dakota  which would cause our tax rates to increase in depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a expense 
despite an increase in production  dd a expense decreased by approximately million in this decrease was due to the adoption of sfas on january   which resulted in a lower per boe rate 
as a result of the adoption of sfas  we can no longer assume proceeds received for the salvage value of our equipment will offset plugging and abandonment costs  and thus are now required to deduct salvage value from the book value of equipment in calculating our depreciable base 
this was the primary driver of the decrease in the average dd a rate from per boe of production during to per boe in we anticipate the total dd a expense in will increase due to increased production resulting from the elm grove acquisition and our planned capital expenditures of million 
assuming capital expenditures do not differ significantly from our budgeted amount  we expect our dd a rate for to be approximately per boe 
this per boe increase from is primarily attributable to higher than historical fd a costs for this rate could vary significantly based on actual capital expenditures  production rates  net profits interests  and any acquisition that closes in additionally  changes in the market price for oil and natural gas could affect the level of our reserves 
as the level of reserves change  the dd a rate is inversely affected 
general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense increased million per boe to million in excluding non cash stock based compensation of million in 
the increase in g a expense was a result of increased staffing levels used to manage our growing asset base and outside consulting services used in the evaluation of potential acquisitions 
we have forecast approximately million for general and administrative expenses in this represents an increase of approximately million from the increase is expected to result from the continued implementation of the hpai projects  increased staffing  additional expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and the changes in listing requirements of the new york stock exchange 
non cash stock based compensation expense 
non cash stock based compensation expense increased from zero in to million in this expense represents the amortization of deferred compensation  recorded in equity related to restricted stock granted under the incentive stock plan 
this amount is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of the restricted stock 
during and  we issued  and  shares  respectively  of restricted stock to employees 
of these   shares issued in and  shares issued in vest in equal installments on the third  fourth  and fifth anniversary of the date of the grant and depend only on continued employment for future issuance 
these represent a fixed award per apb and compensation expense will be recorded over the related service period 
of the remaining  shares issued in   remain outstanding at december  these were issued to two members of senior management and also vest in equal installments on the third  fourth  and fifth anniversary of the date of the grant 
however  these shares not only depend on the passage of time and continued employment  but on certain performance measures for their future issuance 
these represent a variable award under apb and  thus  the full amount of compensation expense to be recorded for these shares will not be known until their eventual issuance 
other operating expense 
other operating expense for the year ended december  increased as compared to by approximately million 
this amount primarily consists of severance payment obligations to former employees 
the remaining amount relates to the inclusion of accretion 
table of contents expense on our sfas future abandonment liability  and the abandonment in undeveloped leasehold costs 
for  we anticipate other operating expense to be approximately million 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million over due primarily to an increase in our weighted average interest rate from period to period  as well as an increase in debt outstanding related to our credit facility 
we incurred additional debt in to fund the north louisiana acquisition 
the weighted average interest rate  net of hedges  for was compared to for this higher weighted average interest rate is the result of the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes in june  which was the primary component of our total indebtedness during  while the revolving credit facility with a lower floating rate was the primary component during the first half of in conjunction with the issuance of notes in june  we entered into an interest rate swap  which swaps fixed rates to floating  with the intent of lowering our effective interest payments 
as this transaction does not qualify for hedge accounting  changes in its fair market value  as well as settlements  are not recorded in interest expense  but in derivative fair value gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
during  a gain of million related to this interest rate swap was recorded in derivative fair value gain loss 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following table illustrates the components of interest expense for and in thousands difference senior subordinated notes revolving credit facility hedge settlements hedge loss amortization debt issuance cost amortization fees and other total derivative fair value gain loss 
the derivative fair value gain of million in represents the ineffective portion of the mark to market loss on our derivative hedging instruments  settlements received on our fixed to floating interest rate swap  any commodity derivatives not designated as hedges  and changes in the mark to market value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap 
currently  this line item on the statement of operations is primarily dependent on the futures price of oil  natural gas and libor interest rates 
this is due to the fact that the main components are the mark to market movement of and any settlements on our commodity derivative contracts not designated as hedges and our fixed to floating interest rate swap 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for increased million over this increase is due primarily to the million increase in income before income taxes from to our effective income tax rate  prior to adjusting for section credits  remained at a constant for both and however  during  we generated million in section credits  as compared to million of section credits generated in this increase resulted in an effective income tax rate of in  a decrease of from our effective rate of

oil volumes increased  mbbls from to due to the central permian and paradox basin acquisitions  as well as increased production from our successful development drilling program 
wellhead oil revenues were reduced by million and million in and  respectively  for the net profits interests payments held by others in the cca 
total oil revenues were further increased by a decrease in hedge payments  which were million lower 
natural gas revenues decreased in by million due to a decrease in the net wellhead price received  from in to in  with essentially flat production 
this price decline is consistent with the nymex decline from to over the same period 
we recovered a portion of the natural gas price decline through our hedges  which generated net receipts of million in versus net payments of million in these hedging receipts are a direct result of the decrease in the average nymex price for natural gas 
lease operations expense 
lease operations expense for the year ended december  increased as compared to by million 
the increase in lease operations expenses resulted from the increase in volumes as a result of our central permian and paradox basin acquisitions and our successful drilling program 
see revenues and production above 
on a per boe basis  lease operations expenses increased from in to in primarily due to higher per boe lifting costs for our acquisitions 
production  ad valorem  and severance taxes 
production  ad valorem  and severance taxes for the year ended december  increased as compared to by approximately million 
the increase is a direct result of the increase in wellhead revenue 
see revenues and production above 
as a 
table of contents percentage of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of net profits and hedges  production  ad valorem  and severance taxes increased slightly from to from to depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a expense 
dd a expense increased by approximately million in this increase was due to a mmboe increase in production volumes  partially offset by a decrease in the dd a rate per boe 
see revenues and production above 
the average dd a rate decreased from per boe of production during to per boe in the increase in volumes caused a million increase in related dd a expense  while the decrease in the dd a rate caused a million decrease 
the decrease is attributable to upward reserve revisions due to higher prices 
general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense increased million in excluding non cash stock based compensation of million in 
the increase in g a resulted from the additional staff necessary after the permian and paradox basin acquisitions to manage  expand  and exploit our growing asset base 
on a per boe basis  g a expense remained relatively flat at during as compared to during other operating expense 
other operating expense for the year ended december  increased as compared to by approximately million 
this amount primarily consists of severance payment obligations to former employees  as well as transportation costs  namely pipeline fees paid to third parties  geological and geophysical expenses  and delay rentals 
the increase is due to higher transportation costs and geological and geophysical expenses in  which more than offset the lack of severance payments in interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million over the increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased levels of debt  amortization of hedge loss see below  and a higher weighted average interest rate in as compared to on june   we issued million in senior subordinated notes  and used most of the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under the previous credit facility and entered into a new revolving credit facility 
see capital commitments  capital resources and liquidity on page for  the weighted average debt balance was million  compared with million for additionally  the weighted average interest rate  including hedges  in was  while it was in the higher weighted average interest rate is due to a higher fixed rate on the notes as compared to the floating rate debt outstanding previously 
at the time the previous credit facility was terminated  we had three interest rate swaps outstanding  with a notional amount of million each  which swapped libor based floating rates for fixed rates 
according to the provisions of sfas  these no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
the unrealized loss of million at june   which was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  is being amortized to interest expense over the original life of the swaps 
we amortized million of this loss to interest expense during the following table illustrates the components of interest expense for and in thousands difference senior subordinated notes revolving credit facility burlington note hedge settlements hedge loss amortization debt issuance cost fees and other total 
table of contents non cash stock based compensation expense 
non cash stock based compensation expense decreased from million for to zero in this non cash stock based compensation expense is associated with the purchase by our management stockholders of class a common stock under our management stock plan adopted in august and was recorded as compensation in accordance with variable plan accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
the million of non cash compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of represents the final amount of expense to be recorded related to the class a common stock 
derivative fair value gain loss 
the derivative fair value gain of million in represents the ineffective portion of the mark to market loss on our derivative hedging instruments  as well as the mark to market loss on our two short puts outstanding at december  and our interest rate swap settlements subsequent to the issuance of the senior subordinated notes on june  bad debt expense 
on december   enron corp 
and certain subsidiaries  including enron north america corp 
enron  each filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states bankruptcy code 
prior to this date  we had entered into oil and natural gas hedging contracts with enron  many of which were set to expire at december   however  others related to and as a result of the chapter bankruptcy declaration and pursuant to the terms of our contract with enron  we terminated all outstanding oil and natural gas derivative contracts with enron as of december  according to the terms of the contract  enron is liable to us for the mark to market value of all contracts outstanding on that date  which totaled million 
additionally  enron failed to make timely payment of million in hedge settlements 
both of these amounts remained outstanding as of december  due to the uncertainty of future collection of any or all of the amounts owed to us by enron  for the year ended december   we have recorded a charge to bad debt expense for the full amount of the receivable  million  and recorded a related allowance on the receivable of million 
at the time of termination  the market price of our commodity contracts with enron exceeded their amortized cost on our balance sheet  giving rise to a gain 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  this gain was recorded in other comprehensive income until such time as the original hedged production affected income 
as a result  at december   we had million in gross unrecognized gains in other comprehensive income that were reversed into earnings during and the following table illustrates the amortization of this amount to revenue in thousands period oil gas total total impairment of oil and natural gas properties 
throughout  futures prices for oil and natural gas continued to decline from their december  levels 
the sec price case used for our reserve estimate was per bbl and per mcf dropping to per bbl and per mcf for the estimate 
although the sec price case does not necessarily coincide with management s estimates of future prices  this indicated the need to assess our oil and natural gas properties for any possible impairment 
thus  we compared the undiscounted future cash flows for each of our oil and natural gas properties to their net book value  which indicated the need for an impairment charge on certain properties 
we then compared the net book value of the impaired assets to their estimated fair value  which resulted in a write down of the value of proved oil and natural gas properties of million 
fair value was determined using estimates of future production volumes and estimates of future prices we might receive for these volumes discounted back to a present value using a rate commensurate with the risks inherent in the industry 

table of contents we performed a similar review at december  and determined no impairment charge was necessary 
description of critical accounting estimates oil and natural gas properties successful efforts method 
we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties as opposed to the full cost method 
in general  we believe that the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas would not result in materially different operating results as we do not currently maintain an active exploratory drilling program 
under the successful efforts method  all development and acquisition costs of proved properties are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves or proved reserves  as applicable 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined to be unsuccessful 
to date  our exploration efforts have been minimal 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from the existing producing reservoir are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures to recomplete a current well in a different or additional proven or unproven reservoir are capitalized pending determination that economic reserves have been added 
if the recompletion is not successful  the expenditures are charged to expense 
expenditures for redrilling or directional drilling in a previously abandoned well are classified as drilling costs to a proven or unproven reservoir for determination of capital or expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced is capitalized 
expenditures to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reserves are capitalized 
internal costs directly associated with the development and exploitation of properties are capitalized as a cost of the property and are classified accordingly in our consolidated financial statements 
oil and natural gas reserves 
assumptions used by the independent reserve engineers in calculating reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
future prices received for production and future production costs may vary  perhaps significantly  from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of calculating reserve estimates 
we may not be able to develop proved reserves within the periods estimated 
furthermore  prices and costs will not remain constant 
actual production may not equal the estimated amounts used in the preparation of reserve projections 
as these estimates change  the amount of calculated reserves change 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
impairment 
impairments of proved oil and natural gas properties are directly affected by our reserve estimates 
we are required to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties and other long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of management judgment  including the determination of property s reserves  amount and timing of future cash flows  and fair value 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a 
dd a expense is directly affected by our reserve estimates 
any change in reserves directly impacts the amount of dd a expense that we recognize in a given period 
assuming no other changes  such as an increase in depreciable base  as our reserves increase  the amount of dd a expense in a given period decreases and vice versa 
changes in future commodity prices would likely result in increases or decreases in estimated recoverable reserves 
additionally  the miller lents  ltd  our independent reserve engineers estimate our reserves once a year at december 
table of contents net profits interests a major portion of our acreage position in the cedar creek anticline is subject to net profits interests npi ranging from to 
the holders of these net profits interests are entitled to receive a fixed percentage of the cash flow remaining after specified costs have been deducted from net revenues 
the net profits calculations are contractually defined  but in general  net profits are determined after considering operating expense  overhead expense  interest expense  and drilling costs 
the amounts of reserves and production calculated to be attributable to these net profits interests are deducted from our reserves and production data  and our revenues are reported net of npi payments 
the reserves and production that are attributed to the npis are calculated by dividing estimated future npi payments in the case of reserves or prior period actual npi payments in the case of production by the commodity prices current at the determination date 
fluctuations in commodity prices and the levels of development activities in the cca from period to period will impact the reserves and production attributed to the npis and will have an inverse effect on our reported reserves and production 
based largely on higher commodity prices  we expect the net profit interest to be higher in the year and possibly beyond  which directly impacts our revenues  production  reserves  and earnings 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized for our share of jointly owned properties as oil and natural gas is produced and sold  net of royalties and net profits interest payments 
natural gas revenues are also reduced by any processing and other fees paid except for transportation costs paid to third parties which are recorded as expense 
revenues are recorded using the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized as natural gas is sold by us rather than as our working interest share of production 
royalties  net profits interests  and severance taxes are paid based upon the actual price received from the sales 
to the extent actual quantities and values of oil and natural gas are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties  we estimate and record the expected sales volumes and values for those properties 
we also do not recognize revenue for the production in tanks or pipelines that has not been delivered to the purchaser yet 
our net oil inventories in pipelines were  bbls and  bbls at december  and  respectively 
natural gas imbalances under delivered to us at december  and december   were  mmbtu and  mmbtu  respectively 
income taxes section credits 
section of the internal revenue code code allows a percent tax credit for certain enhanced oil recovery project costs incurred in the united states 
we believe project costs incurred related to our hpai tertiary recovery project on the cca qualify under the provisions of the code and  therefore  we have reduced income tax expense by percent of project costs incurred to date 
the tax basis for the properties and related intangible drilling cost deductions and future depreciation deductions is reduced by the amount of the enhanced oil recovery tax credit 
in order to qualify for the credits a project must meet all of the following requirements the project involves the application of one or more qualified tertiary recovery methods that is reasonably expected to result in more than an insignificant increase in the amount of crude oil that ultimately will be recovered  the project is located within the united states  the first injection of liquids  gases  or other matter for the project occurs after december   and the project is certified by a petroleum engineer 

table of contents according to the code  the costs that will qualify for the credit when paid or incurred in connection with a qualifying enhanced oil recovery project include tangible property 
any amount paid for tangible property that is an integral part of a qualified enhanced oil recovery project  and with respect to which depreciation is allowable 
intangible drilling and development costs 
intangible drilling cost with respect to which the taxpayer may make an intangible drilling costs deduction election under code sec 
c 
qualified tertiary injectant expenses 
any qualified tertiary injectant expenses for which a deduction is allowable under any code section 
if our federal income tax returns are reviewed by the internal revenue service the irs  the irs could disagree with our decision and disallow a portion of the credit 
while we believe our hpai project qualifies for the tax credit and that our accounting and tracking of the costs related to project are accurate  should the irs disagree with our position  we would be required to record additional income tax expense to the extent tax credits have been previously recognized 
stock based compensation employee stock options and restricted stock awards are accounted for under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  no compensation is recorded for stock options that are granted to employees or non employee directors with an exercise price equal to or above the common stock price on the grant date 
if compensation expense for the stock based awards had been determined using the provisions of sfas  our net income and net income per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  as reported net income non cash stock based compensation net of taxes diluted net income per share pro forma net income non cash stock based compensation net of taxes diluted net income per share hedging and related activities we use various financial instruments for non trading purposes to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our crude oil and natural gas production 
these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases  but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases 
our risk management activity is generally accomplished through over the counter forward derivative contracts executed with large financial institutions 
we also use derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps  which hedge our risk related to interest rate fluctuation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires us to recognize all of our derivative and hedging instruments in our statements of financial position as either assets or liabilities and measure them at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  it must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
however  if a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value can be offset against the 
table of contents change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  the cash flows from the hedging instrument must be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows due to changes in the underlying items being hedged 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be designated  documented  and reassessed periodically 
most of our derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  cash flow hedges are marked to market through comprehensive income each quarter 
currently  all of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
these instruments hedge the exposure of variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized as derivative fair value gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations immediately 
while management does not anticipate changing the designation of any of our current derivative contracts as hedges  factors beyond our control can preclude the use of hedge accounting 
one example would be variability in the nymex price for oil or natural gas  upon which many of our commodity derivative contracts are based  that does not coincide with changes in the spot price for oil and natural gas that we are paid 
another example would be if the counterparty to a derivative contract was deemed no longer creditworthy and non performance under the terms of the contract was likely 
to the extent our derivative contracts are not designated as hedges  high earnings volatility can result  as any future changes in the market value of the contract would then be marked to market through earnings 
capital commitments  capital resources and liquidity capital commitments 
our primary needs for cash are as follows development and exploitation of our existing oil and natural gas properties high pressure air injection programs on our cca properties acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties leasehold and acreage costs other general property and equipment funding of necessary working capital payment of contractual obligations development and exploitation 
our capital expenditures for conventional development and exploitation during the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
for  we expect to invest million in development and exploitation 
we have based our forecasts on the assumptions of per bbl and per mcf nymex prices 
for comparability and accountability  we take a constant approach to budgeting commodity prices 
we analyze our inventory of capital projects based on per bbl and per mcf nymex prices to ensure a rate of return to our shareholders without the benefit of escalating future commodity prices 
if nymex prices trend downward below our base deck  we may reevaluate capital projects and may adjust the capital budgeted for development and exploitation investments accordingly 
high pressure air injection 
our capital expenditures for high pressure air injection during the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
in  we began implementing our second hpai program in the little beaver unit of the cca and began injecting air in the reservoir in december we expect to have the little beaver unit fully implemented by the first quarter of the little beaver unit project was taken from concept to implementation in less than 
table of contents months 
we successfully negotiated a contract from a third party to supply the air compression services to little beaver  which reduced the up front capital requirements for the little beaver unit project 
in  we began a pilot program to begin injecting air into the red river u reservoir in a portion of the pennel unit of the cca 
because of positive results  we are planning to expand the project in the pennel unit of the cca with a million expansion of the project which we expect to complete by early we believe that the hpai program will generate a higher rate of return than other tertiary processes and can be applied throughout the cca 
the zone of our initial focus  the red river u zone  is the same zone where hpai has been successfully implemented by other operators in adjacent areas and on the pennel unit of the cca 
response from hpai investments is not expected until ten to eighteen months from the time of first injection 
for  we expect to invest million in high pressure air injection 
we have based our forecasts on the assumptions of per bbl and per mcf nymex prices 
see development and exploitation above regarding our approach to budgeting commodity prices 
acquisitions 
our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas acquisitions during the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
in  we completed an acquisition of interests in natural gas properties in north louisiana 
the properties are located in the elm grove field in bossier parish  louisiana and are non operated working interests ranging from to across  net acres in sections 
the production and reserves of the properties are substantially all natural gas 
on january   we completed the central permian acquisition from conoco for approximately million 
during the second quarter of  we closed a second  follow on acquisition of additional working interest for million 
the central permian properties increased our operational presence in west texas 
on august  we acquired an interest in oil and natural gas properties in southeast utah s paradox basin 
we will continue to pursue acquisitions of properties with similar upside potential to our current producing properties portfolio 
for the year ended  we evaluated over billion of potential acquisitions 
we do not budget for acquisitions but we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they arise in with the same disciplined commitment to acquire assets that fit our portfolio and continue to create value 
our current million capital budget for does not include any funds for the development and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties that we may acquire during our practice is to review our capital budget following a significant acquisition 
we are currently undertaking such a review in connection with the cortez transaction 
leasehold and acreage costs 
our capital expenditures for leasehold and acreage costs during the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
for  we expect to invest million for leasehold and acreage costs 
compared to historical expenditures for leasehold and acreage  will be a significant increase in capital expenditures 
we plan to actively pursue leases and acreage in our core areas that we are currently operating oil and natural gas properties 
these investments are not expected to result in oil and natural gas production in other general property and equipment 
our capital expenditures for other general property and equipment during the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for other general property and equipment include corporate leasehold improvements  computers  software  telecommunications equipment  field trucks  and field rental equipment 
for  we expect to invest million in other general property and equipment 
working capital 
at december   our working capital was million while at december  working capital was million  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to cash and cash equivalents 
excluding the decrease in cash of million  working capital was essentially flat from to in order to minimize our interest expense  we use 
table of contents excess cash reserves to pay down any amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
however  at the end of  due to the margin maintenance requirements with our commodity derivative counterparties and the high commodity price environment  we maintained cash reserves on hand to satisfy any margin calls as they arose 
thus  we held a much higher cash and cash equivalents balance at december  than would otherwise be held 
this resulted in the decrease in working capital from december  to december  currently  as of march   we have million posted related to our derivatives margin account 
for  we expect working capital to remain relatively flat to we anticipate cash reserves to be close to zero as we use any excess cash to fund capital obligations and any additional excess cash would be used to pay down our existing credit facility 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the overall commodity prices for oil and natural gas will be the largest variable driving the different components of working capital 
our operating cash flow is determined in a large part by commodity prices 
assuming moderate to high commodity prices  our operating cash flow should remain positive for the foreseeable future 
we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for the level of these and other future expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly  depending on available opportunities and market conditions 
we plan to finance our ongoing expenditures using internally generated cash flow  available cash  and our existing credit agreement 
contractual obligations 
the following table illustrates our contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations and commercial commitments total thereafter notes revolving credit facility derivative obligations development commitments operating leases totals amounts included in the table above include both principal and projected interest payments

amounts included in the table above include both principal and projected interest payments 
see note indebtedness to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
giving effect to the cortez acquisition  the pro forma amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december  would be approximately million 
derivative obligations represent liabilities for derivatives that were valued as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of the remaining portions of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note financial investments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative obligations 
development commitments represent authorized purchases not placed to vendors  thus not accrued at year end 
these purchases are authorized and expected to be made during unless circumstances change 
above amounts also include minimum transmission payments for electricity 
operating leases represent office space and equipment obligations that have remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year 
see note commitments and contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our operating leases 

table of contents investing activities 
cash used by investing activities decreased by million from to this was due to offsetting changes in its two primary components acquisition of oil and natural gas properties  which decreased by million  and development of oil and natural gas properties  which increased million 
cash used for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties varies year to year based on our success in acquiring oil and natural gas properties 
our bid price is a price we feel provides a certain level of return based on our expectation of future oil and natural gas prices  while providing potential for some upside realization 
success in the acquisition market is largely driven by competition in the marketplace and in the availability of properties for sale 
during  we were successful in completing two major property acquisitions  one comprised of properties in the paradox basin of utah and one comprised of properties in the permian basin of west texas at a combined cost of million  while in we were successful in completing one major property acquisition of properties in the north louisiana salt basin of louisiana at a cost of million 
the increase in cash used in the development of oil and natural gas properties of was the result of drilling more gross wells net and the expansion of the hpai project into the little beaver area of the cca 
capital resources 
our primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities  and proceeds from financing activities which are used to fund our capital commitments 
our primary needs for cash include our high pressure air injection program in the cca  acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties  development and exploitation of our existing oil and natural gas properties  leasehold and acreage cost  funding of necessary working capital  and payment of contractual obligations 
operating activities 
for  cash provided by operating activities increased by million 
this increase resulted from the increase in net income coupled with an increase in deferred taxes of million  offset by decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities from to of million 
the increase in net income was primarily due to increased production volumes and higher commodity prices compared to financing activities 
during proceeds from financing activities was million  while it was million in in  we were able to close the initial elm grove acquisition and subsequent interests for million and fund our million capital drilling program with only a modest million increase in our revolving credit facility 
during  however  we increased our debt by million to fund two property acquisitions  central permian and paradox basin  and fund million in development expenditures 
additionally during  on november   we priced a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the underwriters also exercised their over allotment option for an additional million shares of common stock  at a price of per share  on december   for a total of million shares 
we used all of the net proceeds to repurchase  shares of our common stock from jp morgan and  shares from warburg pincus at a price of per share 
the million shares we purchased were retired upon repurchase 
our total shares outstanding did not change as a result of this offering 
net proceeds from the original offering and the over allotment option totaled approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses of the offering 
after giving effect to the repurchase  jp morgan no longer beneficially owns any of our common stock and warburg pincus beneficially owns of our common stock 
this compares to when on june   we sold million of senior subordinated notes maturing on june  in a private placement pursuant to rule a 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of the notes  after deducting debt issuance costs 
the proceeds were used to repay and retire our prior credit facility million  to pay the fees and expenses related to the new revolving credit facility million  and to hold in reserve for the paradox basin acquisition million 
liquidity 
our principal source of short term liquidity is our revolving credit facility 
we entered into the current revolving credit facility on june  borrowings under the facility are secured by a first priority lien on our proved oil and natural gas reserves 
availability under the facility is determined 
table of contents through semi annual borrowing base determinations and may be increased or decreased 
the amount available under our credit facility increased in by million to million  with million outstanding as of december  we expect the pending acquisition of cortez will reduce the availability by million 
the maturity date of the new facility is june  amounts outstanding under the facility are subject to varying rates of interest based on the amount outstanding and our borrowing base 
based on our current million borrowing base  our applicable interest rates are calculated as follows amount outstanding rate to  libor  to  libor  to  libor  to  libor  to  libor our revolving credit facility and the indenture related to the notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
the covenants under our revolving credit facility are similar but generally more restrictive than the covenants under the indenture 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to financial covenants  including leverage  interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
our revolving credit facility limits our ability to effect mergers  asset sales  and change of control events 
these covenants also contain restrictions regarding our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions that may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
the indenture related to our notes also contains limitations on our ability to effect mergers and change of control events  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  declare and pay dividends or make other restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates and subject our assets to liens 
based on current commodity conditions  we believe that our capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of our business through and the foreseeable future 
based on our anticipated capital programs  we expect to invest our internally generated cash flow to replace production and enhance our development programs 
during  we have planned total capital expenditures of approximately million  although we may need additional capital to pursue acquisitions or other capital projects 
our current capital budget does not include any funds for development and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties that we may acquire during our practice is to review our capital budget following a significant transaction 
we are currently undertaking such review in connection with the cortez transaction 
substantially all of our capital expenditures are discretionary and will be undertaken only if funds are available and the projected rates of return are satisfactory 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices 
operations and other capital resources may not provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
additionally  we are required to maintain margin amounts and or letters of credits with the counterparties to our outstanding hedges if the mark to market value of our hedges reach a certain negative value 
although we did not have any margin deposits with our counterparties as of december   if commodity prices were to rise substantially  we would be required to post margin with one or more counterparties for expected future hedging settlements 
currently  as of march   we have million posted related to our derivatives margin account 
book capitalization 
at december   we had total assets of million 
total capitalization was million  of which was represented by stockholders equity and by senior debt 

table of contents inflation and changes in prices while the general level of inflation affects certain of our costs  factors unique to the petroleum industry result in independent price fluctuations 
historically  significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  changing prices often cause costs of equipment and supplies to vary as industry activity levels increase and decrease to reflect perceptions of future price levels 
although it is difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas  price fluctuations have had  and will continue to have  a material effect on us 
the following table indicates the average oil and natural gas prices received for the years ended december    and average equivalent prices for   and were decreased by   and per boe  respectively  as a result of our hedging activities 
average prices per equivalent barrel indicate the composite impact of changes in oil and natural gas prices 
natural gas production is converted to oil equivalents at the conversion rate of six mcf per bbl

forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
these statements may include words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  should  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  these include  among other things  statements relating to expected capital expenditures and the focus of our capital program  areas of future growth  our drilling program  future horizontal development  secondary development and tertiary recovery potential  the implementation of our high pressure air program  the ability to expand the program to other parts of the cca and the effects thereof  the completion of current hpai projects and the effects thereof  anticipated prices for oil and natural gas  projected revenues  fd a costs  lifting costs  lease operations expenses  production  ad valorem and severance taxes  general and administrative expenses  taxes  and dd a  timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas  expected hedging positions and payments related to hedging contracts  expectations regarding working capital  cash flow and anticipated liquidity  
table of contents the closing of the cortez transaction and the benefits to be derived therefrom  projected borrowings under our credit facility  and marketing of oil and natural gas 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
such statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the matters discussed in the subsection entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition below and elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
we undertake no responsibility to update for changes related to these or any other factors that may occur subsequent to this filing for any reason 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition you should read carefully the following factors and all other information contained in this report 
if any of the risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and an investor may lose all or part of his investment 
risks related to our business oil and natural gas prices are volatile and sustained periods of low prices could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and these markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
prevailing oil and natural gas prices also affect the amount of internally generated cash flow available for repayment of indebtedness and capital expenditures 
in addition  the amount we can borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination based in part on changing expectations of future oil and natural gas prices 
the factors that can cause oil and natural gas price volatility include the supply of domestic and foreign oil and natural gas  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  political instability or armed conflict in oil or natural gas producing regions  the level of consumer demand  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  domestic political developments  and worldwide economic conditions 
the volatile nature of markets for oil and natural gas makes it difficult to reliably estimate future prices 
any decline in oil and natural gas prices adversely affects our financial condition 
if oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time  we may  among other things  be unable to meet our financial obligations  make planned expenditures or raise additional capital 

table of contents reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 
estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process that requires interpretations of available technical data and numerous assumptions  including certain economic assumptions 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes in conditions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated 
to prepare estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows  we must analyze many variable factors  such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs 
actual results most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves referred to in this report is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the date of the estimate  holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate  and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate 
the results of high pressure air injection techniques are uncertain 
we utilize high pressure air injection  or hpai  techniques on some of our properties and plan to use the techniques in the future on a substantial portion of our properties  including our cca properties 
the additional production and reserves attributable to our use of the techniques  if any  are inherently difficult to predict 
if our hpai programs do not allow for the extraction of residual hydrocarbons in the manner or to the extent that we anticipate  our future results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if oil and natural gas prices decrease  we may be required to take write downs 
we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties when future estimated oil and gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or increases in our estimates of operating expenses or development costs 
we capitalize the costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts accounting method 
the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties may not exceed their estimated fair value 
if net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed their fair value  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
we review the carrying value of our properties quarterly  based on changes in expectations of future oil and natural gas prices  expenses and tax rates 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase 
our acquisition strategy subjects us to numerous risks that could adversely affect our results of operations 
acquisitions are an essential part of our growth strategy  and our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms is important to our long term growth 
depending on conditions in the acquisition market  it may be difficult or impossible for us to identify properties for acquisition or we may not be able to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
even if we are able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  our acquisition strategy depends upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 

table of contents the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we are often not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis 
possible future acquisitions could result in our incurring additional debt  contingent liabilities and expenses  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on whether significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 
competition for acquisitions is intense and may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
the failure to properly manage growth through acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations 
growing through acquisitions and managing that growth will require us to continue to invest in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage our employees 
pursuing and integrating acquisitions involves a number of risks  including diversion of management attention from existing operations  unexpected losses of key employees  customers and suppliers of the acquired business  conforming the financial  technological and management standards  processes  procedures and controls of the acquired business with those of our existing operations  and increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
a substantial portion of our producing properties is located in one geographic area 
we have extensive operations in the williston basin of montana and north dakota 
as of december   our cca properties in the williston basin represented approximately of our proved reserves and of our production 
any circumstance or event that negatively impacts production or marketing of oil and natural gas in the williston basin could materially reduce our earnings and cash flow 

table of contents derivative instruments expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances 
we use derivative instruments in an effort to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas and to reduce our cash outflows related to interest 
our derivative instruments expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances  including when a counterparty to our derivative instruments is unable to satisfy its obligations  production is less than expected  or there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production 
derivative instruments may limit our ability to realize increased revenue from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  on january  sfas generally requires us to record each hedging transaction as an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
each quarter we must record changes in the fair value of our hedges  which could result in significant fluctuations in net income and stockholders equity from period to period 
drilling oil and natural gas wells is a high risk activity 
drilling oil and natural gas wells  including development wells  involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered 
we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in drilling oil and natural gas wells 
our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions or miscalculations  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements and cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs and equipment 
the failure to replace our reserves could adversely affect our financial condition 
our future success depends upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
our proved reserves generally decline when reserves are produced  unless we conduct successful exploitation or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both 
we may not be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis 
substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
if lower oil and natural gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit on our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility  we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to find  develop or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs 

table of contents our business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect us against these risks 
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for  producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as fires  natural disasters  explosions  formations with abnormal pressures  blowouts  collapses of wellbore  casing or other tubulars  failure of oilfield drilling and service tools  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  formation water or drilling fluids  pressure forcing oil or natural gas out of the wellbore at a dangerous velocity coupled with the potential for fire or explosion  changes in below ground pressure in a formation that cause surface collapse or cratering  pipeline ruptures or cement failures  environmental hazards  such as oil spills  natural gas leaks and discharges of toxic gases  and weather 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repair and remediation costs 
we do not maintain insurance against the loss of oil or natural gas reserves as a result of operating hazards  nor do we maintain business interruption insurance 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
we may experience losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or losses in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business 
the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for oil and natural gas  all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations 
future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states 
the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and  depending on their ultimate magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our development and exploitation operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in development and exploitation projects 
we intend to finance these capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations and external financing arrangements 
additional financing sources may be required in the future to fund our capital expenditures 
financing may not continue to be available under existing or new financing arrangements  or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional capital resources are not available  we may be forced to curtail our drilling and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of i 
jon brumley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  jon s 
brumley  our president  and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of mr 
i 
jon brumley or mr 
jon s 
brumley or other key personnel could adversely affect our business  and we do not have employment agreements with  and do not maintain key man insurance on the lives of  any of these persons 
our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists  engineers and other professionals 
competition for experienced geologists  engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense 
if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed 

table of contents the marketability of our oil and natural gas production is dependent upon transportation facilities over which we have no control 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  oil and natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities could harm our business 
we deliver oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may not be available to us in the future 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have greater financial  technological and other resources than we do 
we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas acquisition  development  exploitation and production 
the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies 
we face intense competition from independent  technology driven companies as well as from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in each of the following areas acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  marketing our oil and natural gas production  integrating new technologies  and acquiring the equipment and expertise necessary to develop and operate our properties 
many of our competitors have financial  technological and other resources substantially greater than ours  which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies 
these companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
further  these companies may enjoy technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can 
our ability to develop and exploit our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations  implement advanced technologies  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
we are subject to complex federal  state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 
exploration  development  production and sale of oil and natural gas in north america are subject to extensive federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations  including complex tax and environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  environmental protection  reports concerning operations and taxation 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  reclamation costs  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
we do not believe that full insurance coverage for all potential environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost  and we may need to expend significant financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental regulations and permitting requirements 
we could incur substantial additional costs and liabilities in our oil and natural gas operations as a result of stricter environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
further  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
any of these liabilities  penalties  
table of contents suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could make it more expensive for us to conduct our business or cause us to limit or curtail some of our operations

the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the negative effects of declining commodity prices on our business 
the hedging policy is set by the president with input from the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer 
we plan to continue in the normal course of business to hedge our exposure to fluctuating commodity prices 
the volumes we have capped or swapped will not exceed of our anticipated production from proved producing reserves 
under our hedging policy  we do not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
however  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and in some instances management has determined it is more cost effective not to designate certain derivatives as hedges 
counterparties 
our counterparties to hedging contracts include bnp paribas  deutsche bank  koch  morgan stanley  mitsui co  shell trading  credit lyonnais  j 
aron company  a wholly owned subsidiary of goldman  sachs co 
at december  approximately    and of estimated oil production hedged is committed to morgan stanley  j 
aron company  deutsche bank  and credit lyonnais  respectively 
approximately   and of our hedged gas production is contracted with bnp paribas  j 
aron company  and morgan stanley  respectively 
performance on all of j 
aron company s contracts with us is guaranteed by their parent  goldman  sachs co 
we feel the credit worthiness of our current counterparties is sound and we do not anticipate any non performance of contractual obligations 
as long as each counterparty maintains an investment grade credit rating  pursuant to our hedging contracts  no collateral is required 
in order to mitigate the credit risk of financial instruments  we enter into master netting agreements with significant counterparties 
the master netting agreement is a standardized  bilateral contract between a given counterparty and us 
instead of treating separately each financial transaction between our counterparty and us  the master netting agreement enables our counterparty and us to aggregate all financial trades and treat them as a single agreement 
this arrangement benefits us in three ways 
first  the netting of the value of all trades reduces the requirements of daily collateral posting by us 
second  default by counterparty under one financial trade can trigger rights for us to terminate all financial trades with such counterparty 
third  netting of settlement amounts reduces our credit exposure to a given counterparty in the event of close out 
commodity price sensitivity 
the tables in this section provide information about derivative financial instruments to which we were a party as of december  that are sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices 
we hedge commodity price risk with swap contracts  put contracts  and collar contracts 
swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes 
put contracts provide a fixed floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing full price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
collar contracts provide a floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing some additional price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
additionally  we occasionally we sell short put contracts with a strike price well below the floor price of the collar 
these short put contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  and accordingly  the mark to market change in the value of these contracts is recorded as fair value gain loss in the statements of operations 
thus  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and in some instances management has determined it is more cost effective not to designate certain derivatives as hedges 
the unrealized mark to market loss on our outstanding commodity derivatives at december  was approximately million 
the fair market value of our oil derivative contracts was million and the fair market value of our natural gas derivative contracts was million

interest rate sensitivity 
at december   we had total long term debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the remaining outstanding long term debt balance of million is under our credit agreement and is subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
as of december   we had one outstanding interest rate swap 
this swap does not qualify for hedge accounting as it swaps fixed interest rate for a floating interest rate tied to libor

proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on acreage yet to be drilled for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production
