item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements  including the related notes and the other financial information in this form k 
executive overview we are a leading developer  owner and operator of branded gaming facilities and related lodging and entertainment facilities in growing markets in the united states and internationally 
we investigate developing new locations  purchasing existing operations and expanding our current properties 
these activities require capital intensive investments that have long term return potential 
we have intentionally sought geographical diversity to limit the risks caused by weather  regional economic difficulties  and local gaming authorities and regulations 
we currently operate casinos in iowa  colorado  mississippi  louisiana  and missouri 
we operate a harness racing track in florida 
additionally  we have casino investments in dudley and wolverhampton  england and freeport  grand bahama island 
in iowa  we operate three casinos  which make up of our net revenue 
we have two casinos in the quad cities the isle bettendorf and the rhythm city davenport 
we also operate the isle marquette 
despite the reopening of a native american casino in central iowa and a increase in the gaming tax rate  effective july   these properties are expected to remain stable and benefit from the strength of these markets in the near term 
in colorado  we have three casino operations  which make up of our net revenue 
we have a fifty seven percent interest in  and operate  two casinos in black hawk and a casino in cripple creek 
in black hawk  the isle black hawk and the colorado central station black hawk give us a dominant position in the market that serves customers from the denver metropolitan area 
to increase the appeal of both casinos  we are increasing the number of hotel rooms and parking spaces available in our casinos in this market 
we are also constructing an elevated  weather protected walkway to allow our customers to conveniently experience both the isle black hawk and the colorado central station black hawk 
the construction of these additional amenities has caused considerable disruption 
we are prioritizing our construction efforts to mitigate disruptions as quickly as possible 
however  we expect the effects of the disruptions to continue until spring in mississippi  our four operations contribute of our net revenues 
we operate the isle biloxi  the isle vicksburg  the isle lula and the isle natchez 
in the biloxi market  we have faced the challenges of construction disruption as we completed a  space parking garage in december of and we began construction of new hotel rooms  new restaurants  expanded pool and spa facilities and other amenities 
we expect to complete these additions by the winter of we believe that these additions will allow our biloxi property to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market 
a new hard rock casino and hotel is under construction and is expected to open in spring and other projects are in various stages of planning and development 
the isle vicksburg also faces strong competition as its competitors continue to mak e large capital and marketing investments 
the isle lula has had to face a relatively weak economy in eastern arkansas  its main feeder market 
in louisiana  our two properties contribute of our net revenues 
we are facing increased competition in both the lake charles and bossier city markets 
in lake charles  the addition of slot machines to the horseracing track has had a continuing negative impact on the isle lake charles 
the isle lake charles will also face an additional competitor in the market beginning in in response  we have expanded our grand palais vessel by adding a third gaming deck and are renovating the two original decks  with disruption ending in july the isle bossier city faces additional competition from a horseracing track that recently added slot machines 
likewise  a competing native american casino has entered the southern oklahoma market  further pressuring the isle bossier city s customer base in the dallas  texas area 
the isle bossier city recently completed a new room hotel  a new restaurant  a new entertainment center  and a new pool and spa 
the intense competitive environment in our louisiana markets has adversely affected these operating margins 
in missouri  we operate two properties contributing of our net revenue 
the kansas city property s operating performance has benefited from capital investment despite aggressive marketing by nearby properties and by the opening of an expansion by a neighboring competitor 
additionally  two competitors have announced expansion projects  which are expected to be completed in the next years 
the isle boonville continues to provide stable operating results 
our international operations account for a small percentage of our overall operations 
we are  however  excited about the growth opportunities in the united kingdom 
we believe we are in a strong position to take advantage of the possible liberalization of gaming in the united kingdom 
we also operate the isle our lucaya as a higher end player incentive 
the ramp up of this property has been slower than we expected 
to improve our results  we are focusing on airlifting patrons and cross property marketing efforts 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management identifies critical accounting estimates as those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made those estimates where  had we chosen different estimates or assumptions  the resulting differences would have had a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations  and those estimates that are reasonably likely to change from period to period  resulting in a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
based upon management s discussion of the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  we believe the following accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill and other intangible assets at april   we had goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of million  representing of total assets 
effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the company below its carrying value 
we completed our annual impairment test as required under sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired 
for properties with goodwill and or other intangible assets with indefinitive lives  this test requires the comparison of the implied fair value of each property to carrying value 
the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
property and equipment at april   we had property and equipment of million  representing of total assets 
we capitalize the cost of property and equipment 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
costs incurred in connection with the company s all properties other capital improvements  program  as detailed in the liquidity and capital resources section below  include individual capital expenditures related to the purchase of furniture and equipment and to the upgrade of hotel rooms  restaurants and other areas of our properties 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
self insurance liabilities we are self funded up to a maximum amount per claim for our employee related health care benefits program  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance 
claims in excess of this maximum are fully insured through a stop loss insurance policy 
we accrue for these liabilities based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we also rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments  such as increases in health care costs  in our opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires that we recognize a current tax asset or liability for the estimated taxes payable or refundable based upon application of the enacted tax rates to taxable income in the current year 
additionally  we are required to recognize a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences 
temporary differences occur when differences arise between a the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and b the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in financial statements 
sfas also requires that any deferred tax asset recognized must be reduced by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits that  in our judgment and based upon available e vidence  may not be realizable 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the need for a valuation allowance  are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjusted if necessary 
we use forecasted future operating results and consider enacted tax laws and rates in determining if the valuation allowance is sufficient 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions and are therefore subject to varying tax laws and potential audits  which could impact our assessments and estimates 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings and have identified certain loss contingencies 
we record liabilities related to these contingencies when it is determined that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
these assessments are based on our knowledge and experience as well as the advice of legal counsel regarding current and past events 
any such estimates are also subject to future events  court rulings  negotiations between the parties and other uncertainties 
if an actual loss differs from our estimate  or the actual outcome of any of the legal proceedings differs from expectations  operating results could be impacted 
we routinely face challenges from federal and other tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we record tax accruals for probable exposures associated with the various filing positions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
slot club awards we reward our slot customers for their loyalty based on the dollar amount of play on slot machines 
we accrue for these slot club awards based on an estimate of the value of the outstanding awards utilizing the age and prior history of redemptions 
future events such as a change in our marketing strategy or new competition could result in a change in the value of the awards

results also include the isle boonville subsequent to its opening on december  we believe that our historical results of operations may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the substantial present and expected future increase in competition for gaming customers in each of our markets  as new gaming facilities open and existing gaming facilities expand or enhance their facilities 
we believe that our operating results are materially affected by the economy and weather 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  gross revenues for the fiscal year ended april   were billion  which included billion of casino revenue  million of room revenue  million of pari mutuel commissions  million of food and beverage revenue and million of other revenue

casino revenue increased 
in colorado  a full year contribution by the colorado central station black hawk and the colorado grande cripple creek added an additional million in casino revenue 
additionally  isle black hawk s casino revenue increased million 
we were pleased when a statewide referendum that would have allowed video lottery terminals in all of the state s horse raci ng tracks was defeated 
the gains in colorado were partially offset by the closing and subsequent sale of the isle s tunica and las vegas locations 
because of construction disruptions and increase in the number of competitors  the isle bossier city saw casino revenue decrease by 
room revenue decreased compared to prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease of  hotel rooms resulting from the sale of the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
the decrease was partially offset by increased room revenue at the isle bossier city due to the completion of its room hotel expansion in january of pari mutuel revenue earned at pompano park in florida decreased by 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the general decrease of onsite wagering on horse races 
additionally  the park did not hold live races in july  august or september of to increase the purse pool for later races  thereby decreasing the number of live race days in fiscal year compared to fiscal year pompano park plans to hold live races in july  august and september of food and beverage revenue increased from year to year

we continually strive to inform legislators and the general public of the benefits of keeping gaming taxes reasonable and fair 
our decision as to the amount and location of capital spending is greatly impacted by current and expected gaming tax rates 
gaming taxes in iowa will increase from to of adjusted gross receipts effective july  additionally  we will incur two prepaid assessments due on june  and june  of for each of our iowa licensee s fiscal year adjusted gross receipts 
these assessments will be offset by a credit on future state gaming taxes of each year beginning july  for five consecutive years 
we will also be required to re imburse iowa for all monitoring and enforcement costs of the iowa gaming commission and the iowa department of criminal investigation 
room expenses decreased compared to fiscal year the decrease in room expenses resulted from the sale of our hotel operations at the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas

louis area and the united kingdom 
we continue to seek new development opportunities and therefore expect that new development costs will continue at comparable levels in fiscal year we recorded a million loss on the extinguishment of our million senior subordinated notes 
these notes were replaced by the issuance of million in senior subordinated notes 
we used the proceeds from the notes issuance not only to repay the million senior subordinated notes  but also million of our senior secured credit facility term loan b and million of our senior secured credit facility revolving loans  and to pay premiums and debt issuance fees and expenses 
remaining amounts were to be used for general corporate purposes

as of april   we had million of unused credit capacity under the revolving loan commitment on our senior secured credit facility  million of unused credit capacity under the isle black hawk s senior secured credit facility and million of available credit under other lines of credit 
the revolving loan commitment is a variable rate instrument based on  at our option  libor or our lender s prime rate plus the applicable interest rate spread  and is effective through april our lines of credit are also at variable rates based on our lender s prime rate and are subject to annual renewal 
n bsp  there is no assurance that these sources will in fact provide adequate funding for the expenditures described above or that planned capital investments will be sufficient to allow us to remain competitive in our existing markets 
debt covenants we have various debt covenants as a result of the issuance of our senior credit facility secured by the assets of our restricted subsidiaries  two senior credit facilities secured by the assets of certain unrestricted subsidiaries  and two senior subordinated notes 
these covenants require our restricted subsidiaries and unrestricted subsidiaries to maintain certain defined financial performance measures  including a total leverage ratio below a maximum  a senior leverage ratio below a maximum  a fixed charge coverage ratio above a minimum  and a net worth ratio above a minimum 
in addition  these covenants constrain the restricted subsidiaries and unrestricted subsidiaries ability to issue additional subordinated debt  issue additional capital leases  acquire lines of credit  enter into interest rate hedge agreements  allow liens to secure permitted additional capital leases  issue ad ditional contingent obligations  permit the existence of liens on property or assets that secure the debt obligation  purchase investments in non cash equivalent securities  incur capital expenditures in excess of permitted maximums  repurchase shares  and pay dividends 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our senior and subordinated debt instruments as of april  if we do not maintain compliance with these covenants  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility have the option in some cases  after the expiration of contractual grace periods  but not the obligation  to demand immediate repayment of all or any portion of the obligations outstanding under the senior secured credit facility 
any significant deterioration of earnings could affect certain of our covenants 
adverse changes in our credit rating or stock price would not impact our borrowing costs or covenant compliance under existing debt instruments 
future events  such as a significant increase in interest rates can be expected to increase our costs of borrowing under our senior secured credit facility 
the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and our senior subordinated notes limit  among other things  our ability to borrow money  create liens  make restricted payments and sell assets 
effective as of april   the definition of consolidated ebitda  as defined in our senior secured credit facility  was amended to provide that redemption premiums  fees  costs and expenses incurred in the refinancing of indebtedness are added in the calculation of consolidated net income 
if the current trend of construction disruption in black hawk  colorado continues  we anticipate that the isle black hawk will be required to amend certain financial covenants in its senior secured credit facility to remain in compliance 
although we cannot be certain that such amendments will be obtained from the lenders  we anticipate that they will be 
if these covenants are not amended  the isle black hawk s senior secured credit facility would be subject to acceleration by its lenders 
we are highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms 
as a result  limitations on our capital resources could delay or cause us to abandon certain plans for capital improvements at our existing properties and development of new properties 
we will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations
