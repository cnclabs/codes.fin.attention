item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
dover downs gaming entertainment  inc is a diversified gaming and entertainment company whose operations consist of dover downs slots which with its expansion estimated to be completed by march   will be a  square foot video lottery slots casino complex  the dover downs hotel and conference center featuring luxury accommodations with conference  banquet  fine dining  ballroom and concert hall facilities  and dover downs raceway a harness racing track with pari mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races 
more than of the company s gross revenue is derived from video lottery slot machine win as defined below 
several factors contribute to the video lottery slot machine win for any gaming company  including  but not limited to proximity to major population bases  competition in the company s market  the quantity and types of machines available  the quality of the physical property  other amenities offered on site  customer service levels  and marketing programs 
the company believes that it is holds a strong position in each of these areas 
our entertainment complex is located in dover  the capital of the state of delaware 
we draw patrons from several major metropolitan areas 
philadelphia  baltimore and washington  dc are all within a hour drive 
according to the united states census  approximately million people live within miles of the complex 
there are significant barriers to entry related to the gaming business in delaware  such as the statutory limitation of gaming licenses to the three existing horse racing facilities 
the company s property  designed and developed with the assistance of caesars world gaming development corporation caesars is similar to properties found in the country s largest gaming markets 
the company offers the only luxury hotel in the delaware gaming market  providing a strong marketing tool  especially to higher end players 
the company has  and is currently upgrading  its slot marketing system to allow for the most efficient marketing programs and the highest levels of customer service 
the biggest risks to the company are increased competition in surrounding states from the legalization of new or additional casino or other gaming venues and the fact that all of our operations are located at one facility 
the company has therefore focused on creating the region s premier gaming destination and building and rewarding customer loyalty through innovative marketing efforts and unparalleled customer service 
results of operations gaming revenues represent the net win from video lottery slot machine wins and losses and commissions from pari mutuel wagering 
other operating revenues consist of hotel rooms revenue  food and beverage sales and other miscellaneous income 
for the video lottery operations  the difference between the amount wagered by bettors and the amount paid out to bettors is referred to as the win 
the win is included in the amount recorded in the company s financial statements as gaming revenue 
the delaware state lottery office sweeps the win from the video lottery operations  collects the state of delaware s the state s share of the win and the amount due to the vendors under contract with the state who provide the video lottery slot machines and associated computer systems  collects the amount allocable to purses for harness horse racing and remits the remainder to the company as its commission for acting as a licensed agent 
gaming expenses include the amounts collected by the state i for the state s share of the win  ii for remittance to the providers of the video lottery slot machines and associated computer systems  and iii for harness horse racing purses 
the company recognizes revenues from pari mutuel commissions earned from live harness horse racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks when the race occurs 
revenues from hotel rooms  food and beverage sales and other miscellaneous income are recognized at the time the service is provided 
the retail value of hotel rooms  food  beverage and other items that are provided to customers without charge has been included in gross revenues and a corresponding amount has been deducted as promotional allowances 
the estimated direct cost of providing these items has been charged to the casino through interdepartmental allocations and is included in gaming expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  gaming revenue decreased by  or  to  primarily the result of the enactment in november of the delaware clean indoor air act the act and to a lesser extent from severe weather in february and hurricane isabel in september from january through november  slot win grew each month at an average rate of 
on november   the delaware clean indoor air act became effective 
the act prohibits smoking inside the company s casino  hotel and conference center  restaurants  harness track indoor grandstands and simulcasting facilities  provided that smoking is permitted in up to of the rooms in the hotel

during the first year of the smoking ban  the company s slot win declined approximately compared to the previous year 
in december  slot win increased for the first time in versus the same month in  by approximately 
efforts to seek legislative relief from the law have been unsuccessful 
if the smoking ban continues in its current form  the company s revenues  earnings and cash flows could continue to be negatively impacted compared with results prior to the act 
in an effort to increase the revenues from its three video lottery agents  the state passed legislation in june which extended the operating hours for video lottery agents and permitted the lottery director to authorize additional video lottery slot machines at each licensed facility 
this sets  as the maximum number of machines permitted per licensed agent

net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in as compared with was primarily due to the completion of construction of the dover downs hotel and conference center in april net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the change was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the repurchase of  shares of the company s outstanding common stock during additionally  the company paid  in regular quarterly cash dividends during compared with  during since the spin off was effective march   the company paid dividends for three quarters of as compared to four quarters of and the company increased its quarterly dividend payments from per share to per share beginning in the fourth quarter of on january   the board of directors of the company declared a quarterly cash dividend on both classes of common stock of 
per share 
the dividend is payable on march  to stockholders of record at the close of business on february  on october   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
the purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as conditions warrant 
the repurchase authorization does not obligate the company to acquire any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time 
through the date of filing this annual report on form k  the company purchased and retired  shares of its outstanding common stock at an average price of per share 
based on current business conditions  the company expects to make capital expenditures of approximately  during these expenditures primarily relate to construction and renovations to allow for the addition of slot machines at our video lottery casino  additional amenities at our luxury hotel and site improvements  such as parking and signage  as well as the purchase of a new customer management and slot data system 
additionally  the company expects to contribute approximately  to its pension plans in at december   we had a  unsecured revolving line of credit 
the credit facility was amended on february  to reduce it to  and extend its term to april  at december    was outstanding under the facility 
based on current business trends  we believe that our cash flows from operations and the funds available pursuant to our revolving credit facility  and extensions of such  will be sufficient to meet our short and long term cash needs 
any significant expansion of our gaming facility that we may decide to undertake  any significant acquisitions  or any material adverse change in our operations could cause the need for additional financing 
the company expects that its net cash flows from operating activities and funds available from its credit facility will be sufficient to provide for its working capital needs and capital spending requirements at least through  as well as any cash dividends the company s board of directors may declare 
we expect cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit facility  and its extensions  to also provide for long term liquidity 
the introduction or expansion of gaming in nearby states would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 
however  the company believes that even if some form of new or expanded gaming is approved by surrounding states  the likelihood of any facility opening or significantly expanding in is remote 
recent legislative and regulatory developments in an effort to increase the revenues from its three video lottery agents  the state passed legislation in june which extended the operating hours for video lottery agents and permitted the director of the delaware state lottery office the lottery director to authorize additional video lottery slot machines at each licensed facility 
this sets  as the maximum number of machines permitted per licensed agent 
the company has completed its architectural design work and has begun construction of  additional square feet of gaming space to accommodate installation of the newly authorized machines within its existing casino complex 
installation of all additional machines is expected to be complete by march  the new legislation also authorizes the use of separate video lottery slot machines for promotional tournaments  provides for the introduction of popular franchise games with the state assuming one half of the incremental expenses and allows the lottery director to enter into agreements with other state or international lotteries for linked participation in progressive lottery games 
the new law also revised the video lottery distribution formula to increase the state s share of the video lottery proceeds by assessing a surcharge on commissions received by video lottery agents 
in addition  recent regulatory changes allow video lottery agents to extend credit to gaming customers and effectively removed the betting limit per machine 
on may   a committee created by the delaware house of representatives the committee issued a favorable assessment as to the merits of conducting sports wagering in the state through its video lottery agents 
the committee concluded that sports gaming is feasible in the state  outlined proposed structures for its implementation and provided various financial projections 
the report has been provided to the delaware general assembly for consideration 
by federal law  delaware is the only state east of montana where sports betting is legally permitted  though enabling legislation would need to be passed by the delaware general assembly 
contractual obligations at december   the company had the following contractual obligations as adjusted to reflect the amendment of our credit facility in february payments due by period total thereafter notes payable to banks purchase obligations at december   we had a  unsecured revolving line of credit 
the credit facility was amended on february  to reduce it to  and extend its term to april  at december    was outstanding under the facility 
purchase obligations at december  include contracts related to the installation of additional video lottery slot machines and a state of the art customer management and slot data system 
both of these projects are expected to be complete by march   though payments related to the customer management and slot data system extend into in may  dover downs  inc  a subsidiary of the company  entered into a long term management agreement with caesars 
caesars acts as our agent to manage our video lottery casino and is paid a management fee based on the operating results of the casino 
caesars has been properly licensed by the delaware state lottery office to perform these functions 
the company does not expect to renew the agreement when it expires in december as we no longer rely on any caesars employees or systems 
amounts owed to caesars under the agreement at december  for services provided through that date totaled  and are included in accrued liabilities 
related party transactions during the years ended december   and  gaming entertainment allocated corporate costs of   and  respectively  to dvd for certain administrative and operations services  including dvd s use of office space 
the allocation was based on both an allocation to the business that directly incurred the costs and an analysis of each company s share of the costs 
in connection with dvd s nascar event weekends  gaming entertainment provided certain catering services for which dvd was invoiced  dvd invoiced gaming entertainment  for tickets purchased to the events and other event related items 
as of december  and  gaming entertainment s consolidated balance sheet includes a  payable to and a  receivable from dvd  respectively  for the aforementioned costs and for other payments made by the company on dvd s behalf 
the company settled the  liability in the first quarter of the net costs incurred by each company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the companies had been separate  independent entities and or had otherwise independently managed these functions  however  management believes that these costs are reasonable 
for the year ended december   dvd reported a net operating loss for federal income tax purposes 
the loss was carried back to  a period prior to the spin off  which generated an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward  a portion of which is required to be paid to dvd under the tax sharing agreement see below  therefore  during the fourth quarter of gaming entertainment recorded a  payable to dvd for the company s portion of the carryforward 
gaming entertainment anticipates paying the amount in the first quarter of during the third quarter of  pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  the company paid dvd million for its portion of dvd s consolidated federal income tax liability for since the spin off of the company from dvd was effective on march   dvd s federal income tax return included the operations of the company for the first quarter of the year 
the company s use of dvd s mile harness racing track is under an easement granted to the company by dvd which does not require the payment of any rent 
under the terms of the easement the company has exclusive use of the harness track during the period beginning november of each year and ending april of the following year  together with set up and tear down rights for the two weeks before and after such period 
the harness track is located on property owned by dvd and is on the inside of dvd s motorsports superspeedway 
the company s indoor grandstands are used by dvd at no charge in connection with its motorsports events 
dvd also leases its principal executive office space from the company 
various easements and agreements relative to access  utilities and parking have also been entered into between dvd and the company relative to their respective dover  delaware facilities 
in conjunction with the company s spin off from dvd  the two companies entered into various agreements that addressed the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies and that define the companies relationship after the separation

the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity

factors that may affect operating results  forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to our financial condition  profitability  liquidity  resources  business outlook  proposed acquisitions  market forces  corporate strategies  consumer preferences  contractual commitments  legal matters  capital requirements and other matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
when words and expressions such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans  intends  objectives  goals  aims  projects  forecasts  possible  seeks  may  could  should  might  likely  enable  or similar words or expressions are used in this document  as well as statements containing phrases such as in our view  there can be no assurance  although no assurance can be given  or there is no way to anticipate with certainty  forward looking statements are being made 
various risks and uncertainties may affect the operation  performance  development and results of our business and could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in our forward looking statements  including the following factors success of or changes in our growth strategies  our development and potential acquisition of new facilities  anticipated trends in the gaming industry  patron demographics  general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending sentiment  our ability to finance future business requirements  our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace  the availability of adequate levels of insurance  our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses  management retention and development  changes in federal  state  and local laws and regulations  including environmental  gaming license and tax legislation  the effect of weather conditions or travel on attendance at our facilities  military or other government actions  and national or local catastrophic events 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of future developments  events or conditions 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward looking statements as an indication of our actual future results 
our gaming activities compete directly with other gaming facilities and other entertainment businesses we compete in local and regional markets with horse tracks  off track betting parlors  state run lotteries  casinos and other gaming facilities 
we cannot be certain that we will maintain our market share or compete more effectively with our competitors 
the legalization of new or additional casino or other gaming venues in jurisdictions close to delaware  particularly maryland  virginia  washington  dc  pennsylvania or new jersey  could negatively impact our gaming business 
from time to time legislation is proposed for adoption in these jurisdictions  as it has been for several years in maryland and pennsylvania  which if enacted  would further expand state gambling and wagering opportunities  including video lottery slot machines at racetracks 
enactment of such legislation could increase our competition and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and overall profitability 
approximately of our customers come from maryland  pennsylvania  virginia and the district of columbia 
all of our facilities are in one location our facilities are located adjacent to one another at a single location in dover  delaware 
any prolonged disruption of operations at these facilities due to destruction of or material damage to the facilities or other reasons could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance to protect against such types of disruption  but there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such insurance would be adequate to repair or rebuild our facilities in such event or to compensate us for lost profit during the period of any such disruption 
the revocation  suspension or modification of our gaming licenses would adversely affect our gaming business the delaware state lottery office and the delaware harness racing commission the commission regulate our gaming operations 
our license from the commission must be renewed on an annual basis 
to keep our license for video lottery slot machine gaming  we must remain licensed for harness horse racing by the commission and conduct at least live race days each racing season  subject to the availability of harness race horses 
the commission has broad discretion to reject any application for a license or suspend or revoke a license once it is issued 
the lottery director has broad discretion to revoke  suspend or modify the terms of a video lottery license 
any modification or termination of existing licensing regulations or any revocation  suspension or modification of our licenses could adversely affect our business  financial condition and overall profitability 
our gaming activities are subject to extensive government regulation and any additional government regulation or taxation of gaming activities could substantially reduce our revenue or profit video lottery slot machine gaming  harness horse racing and pari mutuel wagering are subject to extensive government regulation 
delaware law regulates the win we are entitled to retain and the percentage of commission we are entitled to receive from our gaming revenues  which comprises a significant portion of our overall revenues 
the state granted us a license to conduct video lottery slot machine operations and a license to conduct harness horse races and pari mutuel wagering 
the laws under which these licenses are granted could be modified or repealed at any time and we could be required to terminate our gaming operations 
if we are required to terminate our gaming operations or if the amount of the commission we receive from the state for conducting our gaming operations is decreased  our business operations and overall profitability would be significantly impaired 
we believe that the prospect of significant additional tax revenue is one of the primary reasons why jurisdictions have legalized gaming 
as a result  gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes 
these taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations and will likely incur similar burdens in any other jurisdiction in which we may conduct gaming operations in the future 
any material increase in taxes or fees  or the adoption of additional taxes or fees  may have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 
the state of delaware s public smoking ban continues to negatively impact our revenues and earnings the state has enacted a ban on smoking in all indoor public facilities with certain minor exceptions such as fire halls and fraternal organization premises where fundraising takes place 
the ban became effective november  the law prohibits smoking inside the company s casino  hotel and conference center  restaurants  harness track indoor grandstands and simulcasting facilities  provided that smoking is permitted in up to of the rooms in the hotel 
efforts to seek legislative relief from the law have been unsuccessful 
if the smoking ban continues in its current form  the company s revenues  earnings and cash flows could continue to be negatively impacted compared with results prior to the ban 
we do not own or lease our video lottery slot machines and related technology we do not own or lease the video lottery slot machines or central computer systems used in connection with our video lottery gaming operations 
the lottery director enters into contracts directly with the providers of the video lottery slot machines and computer systems 
the state purchases or leases all equipment and the lottery director licenses all technology providers 
our operations could be disrupted if a licensed technology provider violates its agreement with the state or ceases to be licensed for any reason 
such an event would be outside of our control and could adversely affect our gaming revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and holds no derivative financial instruments which could expose it to market risk 
our exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our variable rate borrowings of  at december  under our revolving credit facility 
a change in interest rates of one percent on the balance outstanding at december  would cause a change in total annual interest costs of  the carrying values of these borrowings approximate their fair values at december
