overview we provide a comprehensive range of corrosion control engineering services  systems  equipment and materials  coatings services  and pipeline integrity and risk assessment services to a wide variety of customers in the north american and european infrastructure  environmental and energy markets  including the us government and its agencies 
in july  our board of directors approved a multi year restructuring plan that included a series of initiatives designed to improve our gross margin and operating income and reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
we believe that we have been successful in implementing these initiatives to date 
our gross margin has increased from in fiscal to in fiscal based in part on a number of measures that we have taken  including closing underperforming offices  improving our material purchase program  containing employee compensation costs and restricting nonessential travel and entertainment 
we also believe that we have enhanced our capital structure by implementing initiatives designed to reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
during fiscal and fiscal  we disposed of our middle east operations  asia pacific operations and four other non strategic business units and used the proceeds from such dispositions to reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  on march   we completed a refinancing and recapitalization pursuant to which we i issued and sold  shares of our series b preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  of our common shares to cpi for aggregate consideration of million  ii issued and sold million of our secured subordinated notes and a warrant to purchase  of our common shares to american capital and iii entered into a million senior secured credit facility with capitalsource  we used the proceeds therefrom to repay our prior revolving credit facility and senior notes and for working capital purposes 
we believe that our new capital structure will be critical in our efforts to expand our business and achieve our other business objectives 
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use assumptions and estimates  some of which are significant  to determine certain of the reported values on our financial statements 
although management bases its assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other factors that management considers relevant  these assumptions and estimates could change materially as conditions both within and beyond our control change 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and the related management assumptions and estimates necessary in determining certain of the reported values on our financial statements 
our critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and estimates underlying them  are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
we record income from construction and engineering contracts under the percentage of completion method  using costs incurred to date in relation to estimated total costs of the contracts  to measure the stage of completion 
original contract prices are adjusted for change orders and claims when the change order or claim has been approved by the customer 
cost budgets are revised  when necessary  in the amounts that are reasonably estimated based on the project leaders knowledge of the project as well as our historical experience 
the cumulative effects of changes in estimated total contract costs and revenues are recorded in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known  and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
at the time it is determined that a contract is expected to result in a loss  the entire estimated loss is recorded 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment and transfer of ownership 
accounts receivable 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
historically  losses for uncollectible accounts receivable have been within management s range of estimates 
corrosion control services and products are provided to a large number of customers with no substantial concentration in a particular industry or with an individual customer 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
management periodically reviews inventories for excess and obsolete goods based upon a combination of historical and forecasted usage 
additionally  discrete provisions are made when facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be utilized 
if future market conditions are different than those estimated  a change to the valuation of inventory may be required and would be reflected in the period the conditions change 
asset impairment 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of any long lived or intangible asset may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of the asset may not be recoverable 
if factors indicate that the long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related asset s net undiscounted cash flows from operations over the remaining life to determine recoverability 
the measurement of the impairment would be based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge relating to our middle east operations totaling million based on the current market value of these operations 
this impairment charge was included in results from discontinued operations 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge relating to our asia pacific operations totaling million based on the current market value of these operations and additionally recorded impairment charges totaling million based on a market value analysis for our european and middle east operations 
the asia pacific and middle east operations were reported as discontinued operations and were sold in fiscal in july  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  were issued by the financial accounting standards board 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method for business combinations and requires the use of the purchase method 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and indefinite life intangibles from an amortization approach to a non amortization approach  and require periodic tests for impairment of these assets 
upon our adoption of sfas on april   the provisions of sfas required the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles that had been recorded in connection with previous business combinations 
we completed impairment testing under sfas and recorded an impairment loss  as of april   totaling million of which million related to discontinued operations and million related to continuing operations 
the loss was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this impairment testing is also done annually in the fourth quarter and such testing resulted in no additional impairment as of march  income taxes 
we use the liability method whereby income taxes are recognized during the fiscal year in which transactions enter into the determination of financial statement income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we recorded a valuation allowance for our net domestic deferred tax assets carryforwards of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we maintained a valuation allowance at march  and intend to maintain a full valuation allowance for our net domestic deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the remaining reserve 
until such time  except for foreign tax provisions  we expect to have no reported tax provision  net of valuation allowance adjustments 
in the event we were to determine  based on the existence of sufficient positive evidence  that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
see note income taxes of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
results of operations in july  our board of directors approved a formal business restructuring plan 
the multi year plan included a series of initiatives to improve operating income and reduce debt by selling non core business units 
we engaged outside professionals to assist in the disposition of the domestic and international non core business units 
prior to the quarter ended september   our non core domestic and international units were reported as the other operations and international operations reporting segments 
effective as of the quarter ended september   the other operations and the international operations reporting segments were eliminated and the non core domestic and international units were reported as discontinued operations 
prior year financial statements were reclassified to reflect these non core units as discontinued operations  which were also referred to as assets and liabilities held for sale 
in the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors removed our european operations from discontinued operations 
the board concluded that our value would be enhanced by maintaining our european presence rather than by selling our european operations at this time  based in part on the strength of the local management team  the similar characteristics of the served markets  and the favorable prospects for this business 
therefore  effective in the second quarter of fiscal  we reported quarterly and annual results of the european operations in our continuing operations 
prior year financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the european operations as continuing operations 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for fiscal totaled million  compared with million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
revenues from the discontinued operations were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in discontinued operations is primarily attributable to the sale of four non strategic business units 
revenues for fiscal relating to the domestic core operations totaled million compared to prior year results of million  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily related to a large well casing project being run out of our houston office that generated million in revenues in fiscal compared to million in the year earlier period 
in addition  our commercial coatings offices experienced increased revenues of million in fiscal compared to the year earlier period  primarily due to increased activity levels in our chicago and bakersfield offices as well as increased inspection revenues in our lafayette office 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in several areas of our domestic core operations 
our eastern region offices experienced a revenue decline of million in fiscal compared to the year earlier period  primarily as a result of lower revenues from a large bridge project in fiscal compared to the year earlier period 
also  our water tank business experienced a million revenue decline in fiscal compared to the year earlier period 
this decrease is attributed to the federal epa mandate that all municipal water systems serving  or more customers perform and file security and vulnerability assessments with the epa 
as a result of this mandate  municipal water systems have been deferring infrastructure maintenance as a means of allocating funds to pay for these assessments 
revenues from our canadian operations for fiscal totaled million compared to million  for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
approximately million of this increase was due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar in fiscal compared to fiscal the remaining increase was primarily due to increased volume of material and rectifier sales as well as an increase in the energy segment of our business 
revenues from our european operations for fiscal totaled million compared to million  for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues received from a large contract to perform work on underground storage tanks in the united kingdom and was offset by approximately million due to the strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit 
consolidated gross profit margins were for fiscal year compared to for the prior year period 
gross margins continued to benefit from the restructuring plans and cost containment programs implemented in fiscal and as well as our board of directors decision to approve a formal business restructuring plan in july the multi year plan included a series of initiatives to improve gross margins as well as operating income and reduce debt 
the initiatives that impacted gross margin in fiscal included the following closure of underperforming offices 
at the end of fiscal  we closed one underperforming office 
this office experienced a gross margin rate of in fiscal improved material purchase program 
efficiencies were achieved in purchasing certain corrosion control materials that are sold to our customers 
our material sales center experienced a basis point improvement in its gross margin rate in fiscal compared to the year earlier period 
wage and salary freeze 
we implemented a general wage and salary freeze for employees in fiscal in order to contain costs 
this wage and salary freeze was not lifted until july restrictions on travel and entertainment 
travel and entertainment continues to be restricted to essential  revenue producing ventures 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million of revenues for fiscal year compared to million of revenues for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for year ended march   included million related to professional fees associated with our lender requirements and million for severance and retirement benefits associated with our former chief executive officer 
fiscal year included million in professional fees related to lender requirements  million of pension expense related to our european operations and a million impairment charge recorded for our european operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses continue to improve due to the informal cost containment and restructuring plans mentioned above as well as the board of directors plan also mentioned above 
an activity based analysis was performed to eliminate our non value added costs 
in addition  we continue to see benefits pertaining to the closure of underperforming offices 
also  we have reduced headcount in corporate overhead areas 
headcount was reduced in both fiscal and  which resulted in annual savings in each year of approximately million 
we continue to restrict travel and entertainment to essential  revenue producing ventures as well as restricting the purchase of advertising materials  catalogs  office supplies and other discretionary overhead items 
also  we had favorable claims experience in our health care costs in both fiscal and fiscal operating income loss from continuing operations 
operating income from continuing operations totaled million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal  an increase in earnings of million 
this increase is primarily related to higher restructuring costs incurred in fiscal and improved revenues generated during the fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense totaled million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal we completed our refinancing and recapitalization transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the refinancing  we expensed deferred financing costs associated with the previous lenders of million in fiscal year in addition  we expensed yield maintenance amounts required under previous debt arrangements of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal income tax provision 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended march  compared to a income tax benefit of million recorded for the year ended march  our effective tax rate is based on the statutory rates in effect in the countries in which we operate 
we recorded a provision greater than the statutory tax rate of since we have not realized the tax benefits of losses in our domestic core operations for which a previously recorded valuation allowance has been provided 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our domestic net deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards associated with losses generated prior to our refinancing and recapitalization transaction 
the refinancing and recapitalization transaction resulted in a change of control for income tax purposes as defined in us tax law 
as such  we will be limited as to how much of our net operating loss carryforwards will be available for use in future periods 
loss from continuing operations 
loss from continuing operations totaled million in fiscal year compared to a loss of million in fiscal year  an improvement of million 
the fiscal improvement was the result of improved revenue levels  improved operating efficiencies and our overall efforts to streamline operations 
discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for the year ended march   was million compared to a loss  net of income taxes  of million in fiscal year  an improvement of million 
the loss in fiscal is primarily attributable to a million impairment charge on net assets related to our middle east operations  which was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during fiscal  we  with the assistance of independent valuation experts  completed our initial assessment test and concluded that certain of our goodwill was impaired 
effective april   we recognized a transitional impairment charge of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reduce the carrying values of certain indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill to estimated fair values as required by sfas no 
this is a non cash charge and does not impact compliance with the financial covenants contained in our lender agreements 
net loss 
net loss totaled million for the year ended march   compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year  an improvement of million  which was primarily attributable to million of non cash goodwill impairment charges as a result of a change in accounting principle in fiscal  improved revenue levels  improved operating efficiencies and our overall efforts to streamline operations 
loss per share on a fully diluted basis totaled per share for the year ended march   compared to a loss per fully diluted share of for the year ended march  the weighted average number of shares used in calculating loss per share is computed based on the number of common shares issued and outstanding 
on march   we completed our recapitalization which resulted in the issuance of warrants exercisable for million common shares 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for participating securities  these warrants will be included in the weighted average shares calculation only in periods in which we generate net income available to common shareholders 
net income available to common shareholders represents net income less the annual preferred stock dividend 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for fiscal totaled million  compared with million for fiscal  a decrease of our domestic core operations generated revenues of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily related to our preservation team contracts with the us navy 
since june  we have been providing preservation team services to the us navy under a demonstration contract 
in calendar  these contracts were placed in the normal navy procurement process and put out for competitive bid 
a number of these contracts were designated as small business contracts and we did not qualify as a small business 
therefore  we were unable to compete for these contracts as a prime contractor  although we were eventually awarded a number of subcontracts for this work 
the net result was a reduction in revenues for this work of approximately million in fiscal year in fiscal  we also made the decision to close two offices in new mexico and south america  resulting in lost revenues of approximately million 
the remaining decrease was primarily due to decreased material sales of million and lower revenues generated by our commercial coatings offices of million 
revenues relating to our canadian operations segment totaled million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  a decrease of 
the decrease was due primarily to lower material and rectifier sales and the closure of our office in taiwan

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during fiscal  we  with the assistance of independent valuation experts  completed our initial assessment test and concluded that certain of our goodwill was impaired

on march   we sold a non strategic business unit and recorded a million note receivable  which increased working capital 
this note was collected in fiscal year inventory levels increased approximately million in fiscal year  primarily due to a large well casing project being run out of our houston office 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million in fiscal year primarily due to higher activity levels in fiscal year during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities totaled million  compared to million in fiscal the overall decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the fact that we paid million in yield maintenance amounts required under previous debt arrangements in fiscal we had accrued million of this yield maintenance in fiscal  but it was actually paid in fiscal improvements in accounts and notes receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses were offset by unfavorable changes in inventory and prepaid expenses and other 
as discussed above  the change in inventory was primarily due to a large well casing project being run out of our houston office 
the change in prepaid expenses and other was primarily due to an increase in our prepaid directors and officers insurance of approximately million and an april  payroll payment of million that we deposited with our payroll processor on march  we believe that cash generated by operations and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements through at least fiscal senior secured credit facility 
on march   we entered into a million revolving credit  term loan and security agreement with capitalsource that expires on march  initial borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to continuing fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rates that can affect the cost of operating and financing 
we do not enter into interest rate or foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our revolving credit and term loan facilities  senior secured subordinated notes and various smaller lines of credit that we maintain with foreign banks 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from march   rates  and assuming no changes in debt from the march   levels  the additional annual interest expense would be approximately million 
foreign operations and foreign currency exchange risk our foreign subsidiaries generally conduct business in local currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations and our foreign currency denominated earnings  cash flows and assets 
during fiscal  we recorded a favorable foreign currency translation adjustment of million in our stockholders equity related to net assets located outside the united states 
this foreign currency translation adjustment resulted primarily from the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
our foreign operations are also subject to other customary risks of operating in a global environment  such as unstable political situations  the effect of local laws and taxes  tariff increases and regulations and requirements for export licenses  the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions and transportation delays
