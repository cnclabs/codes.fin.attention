item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we attempt to enhance our profitability with prudent levels of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk by managing our interest earning assets and funding sources to generate favorable interest rate spreads 
we invest in loans secured by single family and multi family residences and commercial properties  as well as commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans 
we utilize excess capital balances through the management of an investment portfolio that is primarily comprised of short duration mortgage backed securities and other investments 
we also attempt to increase our retail banking fee income from deposit fees  loan origination fees and revenue from harrington wealth management company 
our funding strategy focuses on accessing cost efficient funding sources  including retail deposits  fhlb advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  capital trust offering  and a revolving line of credit we have with two unaffiliated financial institutions 
we seek to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk by hedging either internally through the use of longer term certificates of deposit  less interest rate sensitive transaction deposits and fhlb advances or externally through the use of interest rate contracts 
our strategy has been to build a community oriented banking operation in each of the markets in which we operate in order to sustain loan origination and deposit growth and generate additional fee income 
our growth is designed to be achieved internally  although we have pursued  and will continue to pursue  acquisition opportunities when appropriate 
our overall goal is to increase stockholders value from earnings and the growth of our franchise 
critical accounting policies general 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in 
table of contents accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
the financial information contained in our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when recognizing income or expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors to determine the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
we also calculate the fair value of our interest rate contracts and securities based on market prices and the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
we enter into interest rate contracts that are classified as trading account assets or to accommodate our own risk management purposes 
the interest rate contracts are generally interest swaps  caps  floors and futures contracts  although we could enter into other types of interest rate contracts 
we value these contracts at fair value  using readily available  market quoted prices 
we have not historically entered into derivative contracts which relate to credit  equity  commodity  energy or weather related indices 
generally accepted accounting principles themselves may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
as of december   we have not created any special purpose entities to securitize assets or to obtain off balance sheet funding 
although we have sold loans in past years  those loans have been sold to third parties without recourse  subject to customary representations and warranties 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has four components i an allocated allowance for specifically identified problem loans  ii a formula allowance for non homogenous loans  iii an allocated allowance for large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans and iv an unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a model based on historical losses as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the losses incurred in the future  however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the differences that might otherwise occur may be mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
historical loss information  discounted cash flows  fair market value of collateral and secondary market information are all used to estimate those losses 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowances 

table of contents results of operations summary of earnings 
we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and our net income improved by million or during  as compared to and million or during as compared to on a diluted earnings per share basis  we earned   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our income is dependent on loan growth  growth in our securities portfolio  fee income results  controlling costs and our continued efforts to prevent any unexpected loan losses that would require additions to our allowance for loan losses 
during the periods presented  our profitability has been primarily attributable to the growth of our core banking income 
we define core banking income as net interest income after the provision for loan losses plus fee income from banking services less our operating expenses 
we have expanded our franchise during the periods presented  through internal growth  de novo branching and a branch acquisition  which has resulted in an increase in our operating expenses 
notwithstanding increased operating costs  core banking income has increased over the periods 
the following table presents selected information on our core banking income over the periods presented as well as a reconciliation of our core banking income to income before income taxes computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net interest income after provision for loan losses retail banking fees and other income total net revenue other expenses core banking income other noninterest income income before income taxes core banking income as a percent of income before income taxes percent increase in core banking income consists of income loss from trading assets  gain on sale of deposits  gain on sale of loans  other gains and losses and loss from extinguishment of debt 
to a lesser extent during the periods presented  our results of operations have been impacted by realized and unrealized gains and losses incurred in trading account assets  and as a result of gains on our sale of loans and deposits 
net interest income 
net interest income is determined by our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income increased by million or to million during the year ended december   over the increase is partly due to a million or increase in the 
table of contents average balance of interest earning assets  which was partly offset by a million or increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  for an increase in net interest earning assets of million or from the interest rate margin decreased slightly by basis points to for from for  which reflects the growth in lower margin investment securities and the lag time in the repricing of assets versus liabilities 
net interest income increased by million or to million during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  due to a million or increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
for the year ended december   our interest rate spread increased by basis points  primarily due to the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets which is primarily attributable to the increase in commercial loans we hold in our portfolio which carry higher interest rates  and the decline in average rates paid on deposits

provision for loan losses 
we established provisions for loan losses of   and  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management 
our provision for was affected by higher levels of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans 
other income 
total other income has fluctuated over the periods presented  due to our management of our securities portfolio  which is intended to enhance both net interest income as well as other income by capitalizing on changes in option adjusted spreads 

table of contents the following table sets forth information regarding other income for the periods shown 
year ended december  in thousands income loss from trading account assets loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on sale of loans other gain loss banking fee income total other income consists primarily of banking fee income such as service charges and fees on deposit accounts  fees from our trust and investment management services  and other miscellaneous fees 
our management s goal is to attempt to mitigate any change in the market value of our securities portfolio by the change in the market value of the interest rate contracts utilized by us to hedge our interest rate exposure 
for the year ended december  total other income amounted to million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
the increase in other income was due primarily to the increase in banking fee income related to wholesale loan brokerage fees of million and prepayment penalties on commercial and multi family loans of  prepayment penalties and refinancings were higher than normal due to the low interest rate environment increasing activity in wholesale brokerage fees increased over by  or and prepayment penalties increased by  or for over the million of trading asset gains in were due to gains on the cmbs total return swaps and fixed rate mortgage securities  which was partially offset by losses of million related to early extinguishment of long term  high interest fhlb debt with a similar duration of the securities sold 
for the year ended december  total other income amounted to million  an increase of  or during the year ended december  over the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to a million or increase in miscellaneous other income  primarily attributable to fees generated from our core banking operations 
the increase in miscellaneous other income was partially offset by a decrease in income from trading account assets  which declined from  for the year ended december  to a  loss for the year ended december  due primarily to the changes in spreads on the trading account investments and total return swaps 

table of contents other expenses 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding other expenses for the periods shown 
year ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits premises and equipment insurance premiums marketing computer services consulting fees office expenses and supplies other total other expenses 
consists primarily of professional fees  and other miscellaneous expenses 
total other expenses increased by million or during the year ended december  over the prior year ended december   and increased by million or during the year ended december  over increased expenses during the periods presented reflect our growth during the periods  as evidenced in the discussion of the major components of other expenses discussed below 
the principal category of our other expenses is salaries and employee benefits  which increased by million or during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
salaries and employee benefits increased by million or during the increases during the year period ended december  and over the prior years were primarily due to the hiring of additional employees in connection with the opening of new branch offices in scottsdale  arizona in the beginning of and the metcalf location in the later part of  together with our general growth in operations also  commission expense to loan officers increased by  or in over due to the strong loan origination volumes in premises and equipment expenses increased by  or during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  and increased by  or during the increase in premises and equipment expense during the year ended december  and over the prior years was primarily due to the branch openings and general growth in operations 
we have contracted with smith breeden to provide investment advisory services and interest rate risk analysis 
certain of our directors are also principals of smith breeden 
the consulting fees paid by us to smith breeden during the years ended december   and  amounted to   and  the increases in miscellaneous other expenses since reflect our growth over the periods as well as expenses associated with our public company status and new corporate governance regulations 
income taxes 
we incurred income tax expense of million  million and million during the years ended december   and the amount of our income tax expense is a function of the amount of our income before income taxes during the periods presented 
our effective tax rate amounted to  and  the years ended december   and 
table of contents changes in financial condition general 
at december   our total assets amounted to million  compared with million at december  the increase in total assets was primarily attributable to an increase in loans receivable and securities classified as available for sale 
at december   our total liabilities amounted to million  compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents  consisting of cash and due from banks and federal funds sold  amounted to million at december   and million at december  we manage our cash and cash equivalents based upon our operating  investing and financing activities 
we generally attempt to invest our excess liquidity into higher yielding assets such as loans or securities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
securities 
in order to limit our credit risk exposure and to earn an incremental income  we maintain a significant portion of our assets in various types of securities  consisting primarily of investment grade mortgage backed securities and cmos  and remics  which we collectively refer to as mortgage backed and related securities 
our securities portfolio also includes  to a lesser extent  us government securities 
at december   our securities portfolio  which is comprised of securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity  amounted to million or of our total assets 
mortgage backed and related securities  which are the principal components of our securities portfolio  often carry lower yields than traditional mortgage loans 
these types of securities  however  generally increase the quality of our assets by virtue of the securities underlying insurance or guarantees  require less capital under risk based regulatory capital requirements than non insured or non guaranteed mortgage loans  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans  which enhances our ability to actively manage our portfolio  and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations we incur 
securities classified as available for sale  which consist of mortgage backed and related securities  amounted to million at december  and million at december  the million or increase during the year ended december  was primarily due to favorable market opportunities for these securities 
securities classified as held to maturity  consisting of mortgage backed and us government and agency securities  remained relatively stable at the end of the periods presented  amounting to  at december  and million at december  the decrease of million was due primarily to the maturity of a government security during trading account assets 
we also classify certain mortgage backed and related securities and equity securities as trading securities in accordance with sfas no 
and enter into interest rate contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
these assets are collectively referred to as trading account assets 
trading account assets amounted to million at december  and million at december  at december   of the million of trading account assets  million consisted of mortgage backed securities   consisted of equity securities and  of unrealized gains associated with the million notional amount of cmbs total return swaps 
at december   of the million of trading account assets  million consisted of mortgage backed and related securities  and  consisted of equity securities 
the decrease in trading account assets since december reflects management s decision to reduce its trading portfolio and to hold substantially all of its securities in its available for sale portfolio  reflecting management s general intention of focusing on interest income from its securities portfolio as opposed to the generation of short term gains on sale 
this decision is evidenced by the decline in our securities trading since december loans receivable 
at december   loans receivable  net of our allowance for loan losses  amounted to million or of total assets  as compared to million or of total assets at december  the million or increase in the loan portfolio during  and the related 
table of contents loan mix change to higher spread earning loans was due to our emphasis on commercial real estate  commercial and industrial  and multifamily mortgage loans and los padres bank s strategy to broker for third parties substantially all new single family mortgage originations in order to generate fee income 
allowance for loan losses 
at december   our allowance for loan losses totaled million  compared to million at december  at december   our allowance for loan losses represented approximately of the total loan portfolio as compared to at december  the increase in our allowance for loan losses during the periods reflects the growing percentage of commercial loans that we hold in our portfolio which entail a higher degree of risk 
the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions based on our management s evaluation of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio and the real estate economies in the markets in which we operate 
prepaid expenses and other assets 
at december   prepaid expenses and other assets amounted to million  as compared to million as of december  the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets since december  reflected the increase in accounts receivable due to principal and interest payments due on mortgage backed securities 
deposits 
at december   deposits totaled million  as compared to million as of december  the million or increase in total deposits during the year ended december  relative to our increase in total assets was due to management s strategy to reduce our deposit pricing and allow the resulting reductions in higher cost deposits to be replaced with fhlb advances 
we attempt to manage our overall funding costs by evaluating all potential sources of funds  including retail deposits and short and long term borrowings  and identifying which particular source will result in an all in cost to us that meets our funding benchmark 
at the same time  los padres bank has attempted to price the deposits offered through its branch system in order to promote retail deposit growth and offer a wide array of deposit products to satisfy its customers 
in addition to providing a cost efficient funding source  these retail deposits provide a source of fee income and the ability to cross sell other products or services 
borrowings 
advances from the fhlb of san francisco amounted to million at december  and million at december  the increase in fhlb advances since was due to our increased utilization of such borrowings to fund our growth in loans and securities 
at december   our fhlb advances had a weighted average interest rate of  as compared to at december  our outstanding fhlb advances have maturities ranging from to we have a loan facility from two banks consisting of a revolving line of credit 
on october   we entered into an amendment of this facility  the primary purpose of which was to release the stock of the bank from security on the note and to modify covenants after completing the capital trust offering of million on september  our maximum borrowing capacity decreased from million at the time of the amendment to million 
we are currently permitted to borrow up to million under the line of credit through september  our note payable amounted to million at december  and million at december  the decline in the balance of the note payable reflects the utilization of a portion of the net proceeds from the capital trust offering 
we anticipate that we will increase our utilization of the note payable as growth opportunities develop 
proceeds from the note payable have been contributed to los padres bank in order to increase los padres bank s capital and working capital  thereby permitting us to increase los padres bank s originations of loans and purchases of mortgage backed and related securities 
the loan facility is no longer secured by los padres bank s common stock 
our amendment to the loan facility also increased our dividend capacity and relaxed the terms of certain restrictive debt covenants that apply to us pursuant to this loan facility 
trust preferred securities amounted to million at december  and no trust preferred securities were outstanding at december  in september  our newly created special purpose 
table of contents business trust  harrington west capital trust i  issued million of trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities bear an interest rate of three month libor plus  will mature on october  and have a five year call feature 
a portion of the proceeds from the offering were used to pay down our outstanding line of credit 
stockholders equity 
our stockholders equity amounted to million at december   an increase of million from december  net income earned during largely contributed to the increase in stockholder s equity 
moreover  our stockholders equity was also affected by unrealized gains and losses on securities and interest rate contracts  dividends paid on our common stock and the exercise of stock options 
asset and liability management in general  financial institutions are negatively affected by an increase in interest rates to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more rapidly than interest earning assets 
the lending activities of savings institutions have historically emphasized the origination of long term  fixed rate loans secured by single family residences  and the primary source of funds of such institutions has been deposits  which largely mature or are subject to repricing within a shorter period of time 
this factor has historically caused the income and market value of portfolio equity mvpe of savings institutions to be more volatile than other financial institutions 
mvpe is defined as the net present value of the cash flows from an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the mvpe is estimated by valuing our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments under various interest rate scenarios 
the extent to which assets gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liabilities determines the appreciation or depreciation in equity on a market value basis 
mvpe analysis is intended to evaluate the impact of immediate and sustained interest rate shifts of the current yield curve upon the market value of the current balance sheet 
while having liabilities that reprice more frequently than assets is generally beneficial to net interest income and mvpe in times of declining interest rates  such an asset liability mismatch is generally detrimental during periods of rising interest rates 
our management believes that its asset and liability management strategy  as discussed below  provides us with a competitive advantage over other financial institutions 
we believe that our ability to hedge our interest rate exposure through the use of various interest rate contracts provides us with the flexibility to acquire loans structured to meet our customer s preferences and investments that provide attractive net risk adjusted spreads  regardless of whether the customer s loan or our investment is fixed rate or adjustable rate or short term or long term 
similarly  we can choose a cost effective source of funds and subsequently engage in an interest rate swap or other hedging transaction so that the interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are more closely matched 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the board of directors of los padres bank 
the board of director s written policies and procedures are implemented by the asset and liability committee of los padres bank alco  which is comprised of los padres bank s chief executive officer  president  chief financial officer  director of financial reporting and four non employee directors of los padres bank 
the alco meets at least eight times a year to review the sensitivity of los padres bank s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  investment opportunities  the performance of the investment portfolios  and prior purchase and sale activity of securities 
the alco also provides guidance to management on reducing interest rate risk and on investment strategy and retail pricing and funding decisions with respect to los padres bank s overall asset and liability composition 
the alco reviews los padres bank s liquidity  cash flow needs  interest rate sensitivity of investments  deposits and borrowings  core 
table of contents deposit activity  current market conditions and interest rates on both a local and national level in connection with fulfilling its responsibilities 
smith breeden provides consulting services to us regarding  among other things  the selection of our investments and borrowings  the pricing of loans and deposits  and the use of various interest rate contracts to reduce interest rate risk 
smith breeden is a consulting firm which renders investment advice and asset and liability management service to financial institutions  corporate and government agencies nationally 
two of our directors are minority stockholders in and one is an officer of smith breeden 
the alco regularly reviews interest rate risk by utilizing analyses prepared by smith breeden with respect to the impact of alternative interest rate scenarios on net interest income and on los padres bank s mvpe 
the alco also reviews analyses prepared by smith breeden concerning the impact of changing market volatility  prepayment forecast error  and changes in option adjusted spreads and non parallel yield curve shifts 
in the absence of our hedging activities  our mvpe would decline as a result of a general increase in market rates of interest 
this decline would be due to the market values of our assets being more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations than are the market values of our liabilities due to our investment in and origination of generally longer term assets which are funded with shorter term liabilities 
consequently  the elasticity ie  the change in the market value of an asset or liability as a result of a change in interest rates of our assets is greater than the elasticity of our liabilities 
accordingly  the primary goal of our asset and liability management policy is to effectively increase the elasticity of our liabilities and or effectively contract the elasticity of our assets so that the respective elasticities are matched as closely as possible 
this elasticity adjustment can be accomplished internally by restructuring our balance sheet or externally by adjusting the elasticities of our assets and or liabilities through the use of interest rate contracts 
our strategy is to hedge either internally through the use of longer term certificates of deposit or less sensitive transaction deposits and fhlb advances or externally through the use of various interest rate contracts 
external hedging generally involves the use of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  options and futures 
the notional amount of interest rate contracts represents the underlying amount on which periodic cash flows are calculated and exchanged between counterparties 
however  this notional amount does not necessarily represent the principal amount of securities which would effectively be hedged by that interest rate contract 
in selecting the type and amount of interest rate contract to utilize  we compare the elasticity of a particular contract to that of the securities to be hedged 
an interest rate contract with the appropriate offsetting elasticity could have a notional amount much greater than the face amount of the securities being hedged 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all interest rate contracts as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  an interest rate contract may be specifically designated as a fair value hedge  a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of foreign currency exposure 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of an interest rate contract that is  gains and losses depends on the intended use of the interest rate contract and the resulting designation 
to qualify for hedge accounting  we must show that  at the inception of the interest rate contracts and on an ongoing basis  the changes in the fair value of the interest rate contracts are expected to be highly effective in offsetting related changes in the cash flows of the hedged liabilities 
we have entered into various interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging certain of our short term liabilities 
these interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  the effective portion of the accumulated change in the fair 
table of contents value of the cash flow hedges is recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  while the ineffective portion is recognized in earnings immediately 
we have also entered into various interest rate swaps which hedge a portion of our securities portfolio 
these swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are included in the trading account assets and are reported at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments recognized in income loss from trading account assets 
an interest rate swap is an agreement where one party agrees to pay a fixed rate of interest on a notional principal amount to a second party in exchange for receiving from the second party a variable rate of interest on the same notional amount for a predetermined period of time 
no actual assets are exchanged in a swap of this type and interest payments are generally netted 
these swaps are generally utilized by us to synthetically convert floating rate deposits and borrowings into fixed rate liabilities or convert fixed rate assets into adjustable rate instruments  in either case without having to sell or transfer the underlying liabilities or assets 
at december   we held interest rate swaps  which are utilized to hedge liabilities and which qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
and are included in other assets or other liabilities 
these swap agreements had an aggregate notional amount of million and maturities from february to december with respect to these agreements  we make fixed rate payments ranging from to and receive payments based upon three month libor 
these fixed pay swaps are used to effectively modify the interest rate sensitivity of a portion of los padres bank s short term libor correlated borrowings which include short term deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances 
the expense income relating to these swaps was million  million  and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
this income expense is netted against interest expense on fhlb advances in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the approximate net market value of these interest rate swaps was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
effective as of january   these gains and losses are reflected as a separate component in stockholders equity 
prior to such date  these gains and losses were not reflected on our statement of financial condition 
at december   we did not hold any interest rate swaps as trading account assets  except for certain interest rate swaps that we utilize in order to enhance our returns and not for the purpose of interest rate risk management 
an interest rate cap or an interest rate floor consists of a guarantee given by the issuer ie  a broker to the purchaser ie  us  in exchange for the payment of a premium 
this guarantee states that if interest rates rise above in the case of a cap or fall below in the case of a floor a specified rate on a specified interest rate index  the issuer will pay to the purchaser the difference between the then current market rate and the specified rate on a notional principal amount 
no funds are actually borrowed or repaid 
at december   we did not have any interest rate caps or floors which qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
such caps are sometimes used to effectively modify the interest rate sensitivity of a portion of los padres bank s short term libor correlated liabilities  which include short term deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances 
the aggregate net interest expense income related to such interest rate caps and floors was  for the year ended december  interest rate futures are commitments to either purchase or sell designated instruments at a future date for a specified price 
futures contracts are generally traded on an exchange  are marked to market daily and are subject to initial and maintenance margin requirements 
we generally use day eurodollar certificates 
table of contents of deposit contracts eurodollar futures contracts which are priced off libor as well as treasury note and bond futures contracts 
we will from time to time agree to sell a specified number of contracts at a specified date 
to close out a contract  we will enter into an offsetting position to the original transaction 
if interest rates rise  the value of our short futures positions increase 
consequently  sales of futures contracts serve as a hedge against rising interest rates 
at december   we did not have any futures contracts 
we had total gains losses on our futures contracts of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
options are contracts which grant the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a specified price 
generally  we will purchase options on financial futures to hedge the changing elasticity exhibited by mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the changing elasticity results from the ability of a borrower to prepay a mortgage or caps and floors on the underlying loans 
as market interest rates decline  borrowers are more likely to prepay their mortgages  shortening the elasticity of the mortgages 
consequently  where interest rates are declining  the value of mortgage loans or mortgage backed securities will increase at a slower rate than would be expected if borrowers did not have the ability to prepay their mortgage 
we are subject to the risk that our counterparties with respect to various interest rate contracts may default at or prior to maturity of a particular instrument 
in such a case  we might be unable to recover any unrealized gains with respect to a particular contract 
to reduce this potential risk  we generally deal with large  established investment brokerage firms when entering into these transactions 
in addition  we have a policy whereby we limit our unsecured exposure to any one counterparty to of los padres bank s equity during any two month period and of los padres bank s equity during any one month period 
the ots requires each thrift institution to calculate the estimated change in the institution s mvpe assuming an instantaneous  parallel shift in the treasury yield curve of to basis points either up or down in basis point increments 
the ots permits institutions to perform this mvpe analysis using their own internal model based upon reasonable assumptions 
smith breeden assists us in performing the required calculation of the sensitivity of our market value to changes in interest rates 
in estimating the market value of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  we utilize various prepayment assumptions which vary  in accordance with historical experience  based upon the term  interest rate and other factors with respect to the underlying loans 
at december   these prepayment assumptions varied from to for fixed rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities and varied from to for adjustable rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities 
the following table sets forth at december   the estimated sensitivity of los padres bank s mvpe to parallel yield curve shifts using our internal market value calculation 
the table demonstrates the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities both before and after the inclusion of our interest rate contracts 

table of contents change in interest rates in basis points dollars in thousands market value gain loss in assets market value gain loss of liabilities market value gain loss of net assets before interest rate contracts market value gain loss of interest rate contracts total change in mvpe change in mvpe as a percent of mvpe total assets of los padres bank assumes an instantaneous parallel change in interest rates at all maturities 
based on our pre tax mvpe of million at december  the table set forth above does not purport to show the impact of interest rate changes on our equity under generally accepted accounting principles 
market value changes only impact our income statement or the balance sheet to the extent the affected instruments are marked to market  and over the life of the instruments  as an impact on recorded yields 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the liquidity of los padres bank  as measured by the ratio of cash  cash equivalents not committed  pledged or required to liquidate specific liabilities  investments and qualifying mortgage backed securities to the sum of total deposits plus borrowings payable within one year  was at december  at december   los padres bank s liquid assets totaled approximately million 
our liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
our primary sources of internal liquidity consist of deposits  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed and related securities  maturities of short term investments  sales of mortgage backed and related securities and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed and related securities amortization and maturing short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our external sources of liquidity consist of borrowings  primarily advances from the fhlb of san francisco and a revolving line of credit loan facility which we maintain with two banks 
at december   we had million in fhlb advances and we had million of additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of san francisco 
at december   our note payable under our revolving line of credit amounted to million and we had million of additional borrowing capacity under this loan facility 
on october   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement which increased our dividend paying capacity and relaxed certain restrictive covenants applicable to us  which  among other things  requires us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests  including a minimum ratio of non performing assets to total stockholders equity plus loan loss reserves  minimum regulatory capital requirements that are consistent with current requirements for being classified as well capitalized  a minimum loan to value ratio and a minimum core profitability requirement 
the covenant that restricts our ability to invest in mortgage derivative securities has been revised to allow us to maintain a larger balance as of the last day of the month 
the covenant that restricts payment of cash dividends has been revised to provide us with greater flexibility to pay dividends  in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of a  during any fiscal quarter  or b up to a maximum of of consolidated net income for the quarter 
the minimum core profitability requirements have been made 
table of contents slightly more restrictive  and the covenant which addresses los padres bank s non performing assets is new 
management believes that as of december   it was in compliance with all of such covenants and restrictions and does not anticipate that such covenants and restrictions will limit our operations 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally used to pay down short term borrowings 
on a longer term basis  we maintain a strategy of investing in various mortgage backed and related securities and loans 
we use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments  to pay maturing savings certificates and savings withdrawals  fund loan commitments and maintain a portfolio of mortgage backed and related securities as well as certain other investments 
at december   the total approved loan commitments outstanding amounted to million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december  totaled million and borrowings that are scheduled to mature within the same period amounted to million 
we believe that we have adequate resources to fund all of our commitments and that we could either adjust the rate of certificates of deposit in order to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments or replace such deposits with advances from the fhlb of san francisco if it proved to be cost effective to do so 
a substantial source of our income from which we service our debt  pay our obligations and from which we can pay dividends is the receipt of dividends from los padres bank 
the availability of dividends from los padres bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
at december   los padres bank was permitted to pay up to million of dividends to us 
in order to make such dividend payment  los padres bank is required to provide days advance notice to the ots  during which time the ots may object to such dividend payment 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of los padres bank  and other factors  that the ots could object to the payment of dividends by los padres bank on the basis that the payment of such dividends is an unsafe or unsound practice 
in addition  we are also subject to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under our revolving loan facility 
in the event los padres bank is unable to pay dividends to us  we may not be able to service our debt  pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock 
capital resources 
federally insured savings institutions such as los padres bank are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
los padres bank s failure to comply could also impact its overall assessment by the ots in future regulatory examinations  which  if adverse  could also impact its fdic insurance assessment 

table of contents the following table reflects as of december   los padres bank s actual levels of regulatory capital and the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
tier leverage tangible capital capital risk based capital amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands actual regulatory capital minimum regulatory capital excess regulatory capital the tangible capital is computed as a percentage of tangible assets and tier leverage capital is computed as a percentage of the adjusted total assets  both of which are million as of december  contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables present our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payment due period less than one to three to more than total one year three years five years five years in thousands contractual obligations certificates of deposit fhlb advances leases reverse repurchase agreements other debt total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period unfunded less than one to four to after commitments one year three years five years five years in thousands commitments commercial lines of credit consumer lines of credit undisbursed portion of loans in process letters of credit total commitments lines of credit with no stated maturity date are included in commitments for less than one year 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in the asset and liability management section above  we utilize external hedging transactions to effectively increase the elasticity of our liabilities and or effectively contract the elasticity of our assets so that the respective elasticities are matched as closely as possible with the use of external hedging 
external hedging generally involves the use of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  options and futures  which are off balance sheet arrangements 
we use interest rate swap instruments to effectuate our external 
table of contents hedging strategy 
at december   we held interest rate swaps  which are utilized to hedge liabilities and which qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to sfas no 
and are included in other assets or other liabilities 
these swap agreements had an aggregate notional amount of million and maturities from february to december the notional amount of interest rate contracts represents the underlying amount on which periodic cash flows are calculated and exchanged between counterparties 
however  this notional amount does not necessarily represent the principal amount of securities  which would effectively be hedged by that interest rate contract 
our interest rate swap instruments require that we make fixed rate payments ranging from to and receive payments based upon three month libor 
these fixed pay swaps are used to effectively modify the interest rate sensitivity of a portion of los padres bank s short term libor correlated borrowings which include short term deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances 
at december   the interest rate swaps listed below are hedging the interest rate risk of cash flows associated with short term fhlb advances and certificates of deposit with terms between six and twelve months 
these swaps qualify as cash flow hedges

the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments are recognized immediately in other income 
los padres bank s exposure to credit risk from derivative financial instruments is represented by the fair value of the instruments 
credit risk amounts represent the replacement cost los padres bank could incur should counterparties with contracts in a gain position completely fail to perform under the terms of those contracts 
counterparties are subject to the credit approval and credit monitoring policies and procedures of los padres bank 
los padres bank limits its credit exposure by entering into international swap dealer association isda master agreements with each counterparty 
isda master agreements set the legal framework for transactions with counterparties in over the counter derivative markets 
los padres bank only deals with counterparties that are investment grade 
los padres bank has unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit which are also considered off balance sheet arrangements 
a summary of these commitments is presented in the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section above 
inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this prospectus have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars except with respect to securities which are carried at market value  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services
