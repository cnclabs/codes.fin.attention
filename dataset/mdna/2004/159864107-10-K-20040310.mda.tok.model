item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
overview we are a leading provider of critical research tools and integrated support services that enable innovative and efficient drug discovery and development 
we are the global leader in providing the animal research models required in research and development for new drugs  devices and therapies and have been in business for more than years 
we believe our financial performance in demonstrated continued strength in our global business operations 
despite difficult market conditions  we delivered solid revenue growth  improved operating margins  strong profitability and excellent cash flow 
total net sales in were million  an increase of over the same period last year 
favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately to our net sales gain 
our acquisitions of springborn and biolabs in along with the consolidation of our mexican joint venture contributed to our net sales increase over last year 
our gross margin increased to of net sales  compared to of net sales for operating income increased to million in from million in and the operating margin increased to compared to for net income was million in compared to million in diluted earnings per share for was compared to in the results include a net charge of million resulting from an asset impairment charge related to the closure of our biopharmaceutical production facility partially offset by a litigation settlement in our favor related to our french subsidiaries 
the results included a charge of million for the early retirement of debt 
our products and services are marketed throughout the world 
our international revenues  which consists of revenues from our non us subsidiaries  represented of our total net sales in  in and in the increase in international revenues during was principally due to the strong euro and yen 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of  we revised our consolidated financial reporting segments to better reflect the manner in which our operating units are managed 
we believe the revision was appropriate because in a number of changes were made to align related businesses  to focus sales force responsibilities and to simplify management structure 
we will continue to report two segments  now called research models services rms and development safety testing dst 
the research models business will continue to be reported in the rms segment and transgenic services  laboratory services  contract staffing services and vaccine support products and services will now be reported in the rms segment 
the company will report development services  including general and specialty toxicology  pathology services  interventional and surgical services  biosafety testing and in vitro technology in the dst segment 
the changes in segment presentation have no effect on our consolidated revenues or net income 
management believes that the new business segments will better reflect results of operations and facilitate investors understanding of our business 
segment information for the prior years has been restated to reflect this change 
our rms business segment represented of net sales in net sales for this segment increased over the same period in favorable foreign currency translation  increased pricing and higher sales of inbred models  immunocompromised models and increased sales for our services that support research models contributed to the net sales gain in operating income increased to of net sales in  compared to of net sales for the same period in primarily due to improved capacity utilization 
in north america and europe  rms reported slower sales in the late summer of  reflecting greater seasonality than we had experienced in however  rms sales in the fourth quarter of exceeded our expectations  which enabled this segment to record strong growth for the year 
we believe this was due to an improving biotechnology funding environment in the closing months of  which allowed these companies to intensify their efforts to bring drug candidates to market 
we also experienced increased spending by large pharmaceutical companies on research models towards the later part of  as they increased their emphasis on development spending to get drug candidates through the clinic and to market as patents began to expire on many older drugs 
we also saw a continuing investment in basic research by the government and academic sectors  where substantial early research is done 
spending on research models in the not for profit sector also increased at the end of our dst segment represented of net sales in sales for this segment increased over the same period in favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately of the net sales gain 
the acquisitions of biolabs and springborn in contributed to the net sales growth in this segment s growth rate was affected by the closure of our contract manufacturing facility in  which reduced the segment growth rate by approximately 
the dst operating margin for was  compared to in  but improved sequentially from a low of in the first quarter to a high of in the fourth quarter of this segment reported solid sales in the fourth quarter of as spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies improved during the later part of our development services group recovered from the slower demand for toxicology services that we experienced during late and early we believe there is still some excess capacity in certain segments of the market for outsourced development services and some price sensitivity  but customer demand has increased from the low point we experienced in the first quarter of we added capacity in two of our facilities in  and based on projected demand  we expect to add both general and specialty toxicology capacity to accommodate market growth in and beyond 
this segment also reported solid sales in the fourth quarter of as spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies improved over the course of for the fourth quarter of  the dst segment operating margin increased from in the fourth quarter of to primarily due to higher sales and cost savings we implemented in the second quarter of in january  we acquired river valley farms rvf  a privately held medical device contract research business located near minneapolis  minnesota  one of the major medical device and cardiovascular research hubs in the world 
we have combined rvf with our existing non clinical medical device testing business to form a new operating unit called interventional and surgical services iss 
we expect this new unit to continue to grow faster than the overall market for outsourced services 
continued research and development spending by pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and research institutions  and funding of research by government agencies is critical to our continued success 
a substantial portion of our net sales is derived from customers at academic and research laboratories who are partially dependent on funding from government sources  such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies 
we also derive revenue directly from government agencies 
our customers also include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our ability to continue to grow is also dependent upon these industries continuing to spend on research and development at rates close to or at historical levels  and their willingness to outsource the products and services we provide 
while we believe that research and development spending will continue in to be at least consistent with the increases of the past few years  our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by the biopharmaceutical industry  academic institutions and government agencies 
the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of our reportable segments for the past three years 
they also show cost of products sold and services provided  selling  general and administrative expenses  amortization and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
some of those estimates can be subjective and complex  consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
for any given estimate or assumption made by management  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
however  we believe that given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such alternative judgments would materially impact the accompanying financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are most effected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following goodwill and other intangible assets revenue recognition pension plan accounting income taxes and deferred tax assets goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of businesses we have acquired  we have material intangible assets  including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite lived acquired intangibles 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among others  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant  reviews of projected future income and statutory regulations 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
furthermore  changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments thereby impacting the fair value of these assets  which could materially impact our results of operations 
we performed annual impairment tests in and concluded the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset balances were not impaired 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on product and services sales 
recognition of service revenue is primarily based on the completion of agreed upon service procedures including rate specified contracts and fixed fee contracts 
revenue of agreed upon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed  based on rates specified in the contract 
revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in accordance with procedures specified by the customers in the form of study protocols 
the recognition of service revenue requires management judgments primarily relating to the determination of the level of service procedures performed during the period 
as of december   we had recorded unbilled revenue of million and deferred revenue of million in the consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements within our service contracts 
pension plan accounting 
we have significant plan assets  liabilities and expenses based on information provided by independent actuaries 
the actuaries use assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is adjusted based on the change in the long term treasury bond yield as of the measurement date 
as of december  the discount rate for our us pension plan remained at 
the estimated effect of a movement in the discount rate would be to change pension expense by million in the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants 
if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets  the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately to years 
during  we lowered our expected return on plan assets to from for our us pension plan 
this is expected to increase the annual pension expense by approximately million in income taxes and deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
as part of our recapitalization transaction  we elected under internal revenue code section h to treat the transaction as a purchase resulting in a step up in the tax basis of the underlying assets 
the election resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset in in the amount of million for the estimated future tax benefits associated with the increased tax basis of the assets 
the balance of this deferred tax asset as of december  was million 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million existed on a total net deferred tax asset of million 
to the extent we increase this valuation allowance in a period  we must report the effect as additional tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
a valuation allowance is currently set against deferred tax assets because management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
as of december   earnings from non us subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled million and  accordingly  no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon 
distribution of those earnings would be subject to us taxes and withholding taxes payable to foreign countries  however  it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed earnings 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease our deferred tax assets and materially impact our results of operations 
furthermore in the event that actual results differ from management s estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
in the first quarter of  the company began a reorganization of its european operations 
the purpose of the reorganization is to streamline the corporate legal structure in order to improve operating efficiency and cash management  facilitate acquisitions and provide tax benefits 
the reorganization  which will not involve reductions of personnel or facility closures  is expected to result in a one time  non cash charge to earnings in the first quarter of of approximately  primarily due to the write off of a deferred tax asset 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to the increase in sales in our rms segment during research models services 
in  rms net sales were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately to our net sales gain 
rms prices increased at certain geographical locations in a range up to with the weighted average increase of approximately 
increased unit volume sales of both models and services added approximately to the net sales growth 
research model unit sales increased primarily due to increased demand for our higher priced specialty units 
sales of our research model services increased in due to increased pricing  the consolidation of our mexican joint venture and an increased market demand 
the rms increase was driven by basic research and biotechnology spending  which drove greater demand for our services that support research models  primarily transgenics and laboratory services 
this growth reflects the increasing number of new disease models being created and the corresponding need for sophisticated housing and related high value services 
development safety testing 
in  dst net sales were million  an increase of million  or  from million in favorable foreign currency translation contributed approximately to our net sales gain 
dst sales increased in primarily due to our acquisitions and an increase in in vitro safety testing sales  partially offset by the impact of reduced market demand for toxicology services in early  lower sales in our biosafety testing services business  and the closure of our contract manufacturing facility 
the acquisitions of biolabs and springborn contributed million  or  to the net sales growth in during  dst experienced pricing pressures due to decreased demand earlier in the year resulting in a nominal price decline for the year 
our development services group recovered from the slower demand for toxicology services we experienced during late and early we believe there is still some excess capacity in certain segments of the market for outsourced development services  causing lingering price sensitivity 
cost of products sold and services provided 
cost of products sold and services provided in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in cost of products sold and services provided in was of net sales  compared to in the increase in cost of products sold and services provided was due primarily to adverse foreign currency exchange of approximately  increased product volume and general inflation

selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in selling  general and administrative expenses in were of net sales compared to of net sales in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was due primarily to adverse foreign currency exchange  a full year of expenses related to the acquisitions and inflation  partially offset by the cost savings initiatives we implemented in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our ability to manage our cost increases at a rate slightly lower than our sales growth 
research models services 
selling  general and administrative expenses for rms in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased to of net sales  compared to of net sales in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to our efforts to limit our expense growth 
development safety testing selling  general and administrative expenses for dst in were million  an increase of million compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses in were of net sales  compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses for were virtually flat due mainly to the cost savings initiatives we implemented at the beginning of  partially offset by the full year effect of the acquisitions of springborn and biolabs 
unallocated corporate overhead 
unallocated corporate overhead  which consists of various corporate expenses including those associated with executive salaries and departments such as corporate accounting  legal and investor relations  was million in  compared to million in the increase in unallocated corporate overhead in was due to an increased pension expense of million  partially offset by lower bonuses for other operating expenses income 
during  we recorded a million charge associated with the write down of certain contract manufacturing assets 
also during  our french subsidiaries settled a breach of contract claim they had asserted against a customer 
after legal and related expenses  the net settlement amounted to a gain of approximately million 
amortization of other intangibles

other income 
other income for was million compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower net foreign currency gains then in income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was compared to the rate of  which included a million benefit associated with the release of a valuation allowance in during  we reassessed the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset associated with state net operating loss carryforwards due to state tax planning initiatives and the completion of the state income tax returns

rms global prices increased in a range up to with the average approximately 
increased unit volume sales of both models and services added approximately to net sales increase 
sales of our research models increased due to an increase in unit volume and a shift in demand to higher priced research models  additional sales from our acquisition of genetic models  inc gmi and increased sales of unique specialty models through our cooperative agreement with the jackson laboratory 
sales of our research model services increased in due to strong sales growth from our transgenics and contract staffing businesses  increased pricing and the consolidation of our mexican joint venture 
development safety testing in  net sales from our dst segment were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the increase was due to continued growth in outsourcing in the pharmaceutical industry  expanded in vitro sales and the acquisitions of biolabs and springborn which contributed million  or  partially offset by reduced business at our contract manufacturing facility

net income in was million  an increase of million from million in liquidity and capital resources the following discussion analyzes liquidity and capital resources by operating  investing and financing activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations  our revolving line of credit arrangements  and proceeds from our debt and equity offerings 
on march   we entered into a revolving credit agreement which matures on march  the agreement permits us to borrow up to million at an interest rate based on  at the company s option  the greatest of the prime rate  the base cd rate plus  and the federal funds effective rate plus  or libor multiplied by the statutory reserve rate plus a spread of to based on our leverage ratio and the aggregate borrowing under the revolving credit agreement 
interest is payable based on our option of interest rate selected  which ranges from monthly to semi annually 
the credit agreement requires us to pay a quarterly commitment fee which ranges from through basis points on the undrawn balance  based on our leverage ratio 
the agreement also requires us to remain in compliance with certain financial ratios as well as other restrictive covenants 
some of the restrictive covenants limit our ability to acquire companies  increase our debt and pay dividends 
there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  effective january   we acquired an additional of the equity  common shares of our then equity joint venture company  charles river japan  from ajinomoto company  inc the purchase price for the equity was billion yen  or million  which was paid in cash 
in connection with the acquisition of springborn in  we entered into a million three year unsecured subordinated note 
the note was payable in three equal annual installments of principal  together with interest accrued in arrears commencing on october  the note was repaid in full early during on january   we issued million par value of senior convertible debentures through a private placement offering 
on february   we issued an additional million par value of the senior convertible debentures through the additional purchase option 
the senior convertible debentures accrue interest at an initial annual rate of which will be reset but not below the initial rate of or above on august   august  and august  interest is payable semi annually in arrears  beginning august  the senior convertible debentures will mature in and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of  subject to adjustments under certain circumstances

in addition  upon a change in control of our company occurring on or prior to february   each holder may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s debentures for cash 
in  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the senior convertible debenture offering to retire all of the senior subordinated notes through a tender offer 
during  we repaid our outstanding senior secured term loan facilities and terminated our revolving credit facility 
as a result of the termination of our revolving credit facility  we were required to transfer million into a separate bank account to support outstanding letters of credit 
this amount was reported as restricted cash in our consolidated financial statements as of december  during the second quarter of  the restriction was lifted due to the new revolving credit agreement entered into by the company 
as of december  and december   we had approximately million and million outstanding under letters of credit  respectively 
on july   we consummated a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  which we used to repay a portion of our indebtedness and retire obligations incurred in connection with acquisitions made in on march   we consummated a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million  which we used to repay a portion of our indebtedness and retire obligations incurred in connection with acquisitions made in we anticipate that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due 
we currently intend to retain any earnings to finance future operations  expansion and acquisitions 
charles river laboratories international  inc is a holding company with ownership of of the common stock of its subsidiary  charles river laboratories  inc in order to repay our obligations  we are dependent upon either dividends from charles river laboratories  inc  which are restricted by terms contained in the agreement governing the revolving credit facility  or through a refinancing or equity transaction 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities in and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operations was primarily a result of the increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accrued compensation partially offset by the utilization of our deferred tax asset 
our days sales outstanding increased to days as of december   compared to days as of december  in addition  in we had a significant improvement in dso  which added million to cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities in and was million and million  respectively 
in we used million for capital expenditures  million for the purchase of marketable securities and million for the acquisition of an additional of the equity of charles river japan 
this compared to during which we used net cash of million to acquire biolabs and springborn and million for capital expenditures 
in  we made capital expenditures in rms and dst which were million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that the future capital expenditures will be funded by cash provided by operating activities 
for  we project capital expenditure to be approximately million 
we continue to evaluate acquisitions to serve as growth platforms as evidenced by our acquisition of rvf in january we have various options for financing future acquisitions  including our existing cash and investments  cash flow provided by operations  and our ability to raise capital through debt and equity financing 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities in of million 
during  we received debt proceeds of million and repaid debt of million 
in  we issued million par value of senior convertible debentures and we used million of the proceeds to repay all of the senior subordinated notes and million to repay our outstanding senior secured credit facilities 
minimum future payments of our contractual obligations at december  are as follows contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the contractual obligation for long term debt assumes the senior convertible debentures will be repurchased by us in when holders of the debentures may exercise the right to require such repurchase 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements during any of fiscal  or fiscal compared to fiscal cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities in and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily a result of improved operating performance during and our reduction of accounts receivable 
our days sales outstanding decreased to days as of december   from days as of december   which contributed million to cash flow primarily due to improved collection efforts 
net cash used in investing activities in and was million and million  respectively 
in we used cash of million to acquire biolabs and springborn and capital expenditures of million of which million was related to rms and million to dst 
this compared to during which we used net cash of million to acquire pai  primedica and gmi and used million for capital expenditures
