item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading food distribution and retail companies in the united states  with approximately billion in annual sales 
approximately of our sales come from our food distribution segment  which sells and distributes a wide variety of nationally branded and private label grocery products from distribution centers to more than  grocery stores and institutional customers located in states  primarily in the midwest and southeast 
approximately of our annual sales come from our military food distribution segment  which contracts with vendors to distribute a wide variety of grocery products to military commissaries and military distribution centers supporting over military commissaries located primarily in the mid atlantic region of the united states  and in europe  cuba  puerto rico and iceland 
the remaining of our annual sales come from our retail segment  which operates corporate owned stores primarily in the upper midwest 
our food distribution and retail businesses operate in intensely competitive industries  characterized by low profit margins and increasing consolidation 
alternative store formats  such as supercenters  warehouse clubs and extreme value food stores  have gained and continue to gain market share at the expense of conventional grocery stores  which represent the substantial majority of our corporate owned stores as well as of our independent retail customer base 
largely as a result of this trend  but also as a result of difficult economic conditions in and the first part of  over the three years discussed in this report we have experienced decreasing same store sales in our retail segment and  to a lesser degree  attrition among the existing customer base in our food distribution segment 
despite these competitive pressures  our annual sales over this three year period have been relatively flat as a result of new business gained by our food distribution and military distribution businesses 
during  competitive conditions in the food distribution industry were affected by the bankruptcy filing of fleming companies  inc  at the time one of the largest independent food wholesalers in the united states  and the subsequent sale of its wholesale business including its customer contracts to several competitors 
although we did not purchase any portion of the fleming wholesale business  during the second half of sales in our food distribution segment increased in large measure because we were able to obtain the business of former fleming wholesale customers who were not under contract to fleming 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  food distribution sales increased over the year earlier quarter after adjusting for the extra week in the quarter  as a result of gaining former fleming customers and other new accounts  as well as growth from our existing customer base 
our military food distribution segment continues to experience solid year over year sales growth 
this was driven by higher sales to military bases both overseas and in the us we believe that the high ratings we consistently receive on key service metrics from the defense commissary agency have helped us win new business 
during  we completed the consolidation of our two large military distribution warehouses into one located in norfolk  virginia 
although this project included transition expenses that had an impact on earnings  in the fourth quarter of that year we began to realize the efficiencies expected when that project was undertaken  and expect those benefits to continue 
despite the decrease in same store sales in our retail segment  we believe that we have a defensible market position in the upper midwest 
we believe that approximately of our conventional grocery stores are number or number by sales in their respective local markets  which include all supermarkets and supercenters within the respective city limits in which our stores are located 
to defend and improve upon our position  we recognize that we must successfully undertake and complete various initiatives  such as more consistent store level execution across the store base  refocusing on perishables  and providing more attractive promotional programs 
we are also carefully studying the competitive position of each of our stores in each local market in which we operate 
during  we reduced total debt including capital lease obligations by million as part of a continuing effort to reduce the company s leverage  and we believe that doing so reduces the risk profile of the company 
in february  our board increased our quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
with the exception of temporary draws on our revolving credit line to build inventories for certain holidays during the year  we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to enable us to further reduce our debt during reducing dependence on debt also frees up borrowing capacity to enable us to take advantage of potential acquisition or investment opportunities that present themselves 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal however  fiscal results are not directly comparable to fiscal or because fiscal contained an additional week 
sales the following tables summarize our sales activity for fiscal  and in millions 
segment sales sales percent of sales percent change sales percent of sales percent change sales percent of sales food distribution military retail total sales the following table summarizes the impact on company and segment sales of the additional week in the fourth fiscal quarter of adjusted fiscal sales for the effect of an additional week of sales in millions segment sales sales rd week sales comparable weeks of sales comparable percent change from food distribution military retail total sales the increase in food distribution sales in fiscal is largely attributable to new business with former fleming customers and other new accounts  as well as growth from our existing customer base 
partially offsetting this increase were reduced sales and store closings by certain independent retailers because of increased competition in their respective markets 
the decrease in food distribution sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to difficult economic conditions  reduced demand on the part of independent retailers  and the elimination of marginal accounts we chose to no longer service 
the increase in military segment sales in fiscal was largely attributable to increases in year over year sales to commissaries in the united states and overseas 
the increased sales in fiscal relative to were attributable to an increase in export sales  primarily due to the positive impact of the military deployment to the middle east during fiscal the decrease in retail segment sales from fiscal to fiscal primarily reflects a decrease in same store sales 
while same store sales declined from fiscal to fiscal  the impact on retail segment sales was largely offset by the acquisition of u save foods inc u save in the second half of fiscal these declines in same store sales primarily reflected the growth of supercenter competition in our retail territories and retail consumers purchasing less in conventional supermarket channels 
we are implementing various initiatives to improve our same store sales performance 
these initiatives may not have an immediate impact on same store sales  however the results of our initiatives are intended to become evident in our same store sales comparisons as the year progresses 
during fiscal and  our corporate store count changed as follows fiscal year fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores acquired stores closed or sold stores number of stores at end of year gross profit gross profit calculated as sales less cost of sales for fiscal was of sales compared to for fiscal and for fiscal gross profit was negatively impacted in fiscal versus fiscal because retail segment sales  which earn a higher gross profit than food distribution and military distribution segment sales  represented a smaller percentage of our total sales 
in addition  the costs associated with the consolidation of two large warehouse facilities in the military distribution segment reduced gross profit by million 
gross profit was positively impacted in fiscal versus fiscal by an increase in retail segment sales as a percentage of our total sales  by distribution efficiencies gained in our food distribution segment  and by more efficient use of promotional spending in our retail segment 
in addition  gross profit comparisons benefited from lifo credits of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  compared to a lifo charge of million in fiscal the lifo credits in fiscal and were due to food price deflation and decreased inventory levels as a result of lower sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we early adopted the provisions of eitf no 
accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  see new accounting standards below for discussion retroactive to the beginning of fiscal the impact of the adoption on gross profit in fiscal  excluding the cumulative effect adjustment  was an increase of million 
in addition  the adoption resulted in a reclassification of million of net cooperative advertising income from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal were of sales as compared to of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to several factors 
sg a expenses were reduced in fiscal compared to fiscal because retail segment sales  which have higher sg a expenses than food distribution and military distribution segment sales  represented a smaller percentage of our total sales 
in addition  health insurance expense for fiscal decreased by million  primarily reflecting a decision to eliminate post retirement medical benefits for active non union employees in the fourth quarter 
charges for asset impairments decreased million from fiscal to  from million to million 
the impairment charges for fiscal and related to six and fifteen stores  respectively  whose carrying values were impaired due to increased competition within the stores respective market areas 
partially offsetting these decreases was a decrease of million in gains on the sale of real estate  from million in to million in the increase in sg a expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales from to primarily reflected an increase in retail segment sales  which have higher sg a expenses than food distribution and military distribution segment sales  as a percentage of our total sales 
in addition  an increase of million in asset impairments  from million to million  a million increase in bad debt expense from million to million  and the reclassification of net cooperative advertising income of million in to cost of sales in accordance with eitf no 
 all contributed to an increase in sg a expenses in fiscal from the impairment charges in fiscal resulted from our decision to close two stores  as well as the write down of the carrying value of three additional stores 
the increase in bad debt expense is primarily attributed to the increased competitive pressure experienced by our independent retailers 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase of million in gains from the sale of real estate  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal special charges we recorded special charges totaling million in fiscal and million offset by million of fiscal charge adjustments in fiscal these charges affected our food distribution and retail segments and were also designed to redirect our technology efforts 
all actions contemplated by the charges are complete 
at january   the remaining accrued liability was million and consisted primarily of lease commitments 
during fiscal  the company reversed million and million of its fiscal and special charges  respectively  due to agreements reached to settle certain leases for less than what the company had originally estimated 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased by compared to fiscal the increase primarily represents the addition of information technology software in depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal decreased by from fiscal  primarily reflecting the elimination of goodwill amortization of million resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
 at the beginning of fiscal  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested at least annually for impairment 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased by compared to fiscal  primarily due to million paid to our bondholders and million paid to our bank lenders in the first quarter of as consideration for waivers to extend the deadlines for filing our third quarter form q for fiscal  our form k for fiscal and our first quarter form q for fiscal apart from the waiver fees  the impact of an increase in our average borrowing rate under the bank credit facility from in fiscal to in fiscal was offset by a decrease in our average borrowing level under that facility  from million in to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased by from fiscal  primarily reflecting a million reduction in interest expense  including the effects of the interest rate swaps  paid under the bank credit facility as a result of a lower average borrowing rate in fiscal and in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the average borrowing level million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the reduction in the effective rate from fiscal to fiscal was the result of the resolution of various outstanding state and federal tax issues which reduced income tax expense by million in fiscal the reduction in the effective rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributed to changes in accounting rules relating to the elimination of goodwill amortization for financial reporting as well as a higher proportion of taxable income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions 
refer to the tax rate table in part ii  item of this report under note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for the comparative components of these rates 
discontinued operations the gain on discontinued operations of million in fiscal was a result of the resolution of a contingency associated with the sale of our nash de camp produce growing and marketing subsidiary in fiscal cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash considerations received from a vendor as of the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect at the beginning of fiscal was a charge of million  net of income taxes of million 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle has been presented in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal see critical accounting polices under the caption vendor allowances and credits and new accounting standards in part ii  item of this report 
net earnings net earnings for fiscal were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and million  or per diluted share  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our capital needs through a combination of internal and external sources 
these sources include cash flow from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing 
during  we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and enable us to further reduce our debt  with temporary draws on our revolving credit line needed during the year to build inventories for certain holidays 
longer term  we believe that cash flows from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing will be adequate to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
operating cash flows increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primary contributors to the increase were increased earnings of million and more efficient receivables management  which resulted in a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal compared to fiscal of million was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts payable decreased by approximately million which was partially offset by a decrease in inventory balances of approximately million 
both of the changes were the result of management s efforts to reduce inventory levels in conjunction with a lower sales volume 
cash used for investing activities increased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal  but decreased million from fiscal to the reduction in cash used for investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily relates to the level of acquisitions in fiscal relative to fiscal and the reduction in loans extended to customers during fiscal we expect our capital expenditures for fiscal to approximate million excluding acquisitions 
these expenditures are expected to be spent evenly between our food distribution segment  food retailing segment and corporate projects 
cash used for financing activities increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to million used to pay down our revolving bank credit facility 
at january   credit availability under this facility was million 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of january   and the expected timing of cash payments related to such obligations in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years over years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the  shown as scheduled for payment in years includes repayment of the bank credit facility  which has a five year term ending december   based on the current outstanding balance of  typically  we are able to refinance our bank credit facility with a new agreement either before or upon maturity  and anticipate refinancing the current agreement in fiscal refer to part ii  item in this report under note long term debt and bank credit facilities in notes to consolidated financial statements and to the discussion of covenant compliance below for additional information regarding long term debt 
lease obligations primarily relate to store locations for our retail segment  as well as store locations subleased to independent food distribution customers 
a discussion of lease commitments can be found in part ii  item in this report under note leases in notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption lease commitments under critical accounting policies  below 
includes amounts classified as imputed interest 
the majority of our purchase obligations involve purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business  which are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders are based on our current product needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within very short time horizons 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable upon shipment of the underlying product 
the purchase obligations shown in this table also exclude agreements that are cancelable by us without significant penalty  which include contracts for routine outsourced services 
the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table represents the amount of product we are contractually obligated to purchase to earn million in upfront contract monies received 
should we not be able to fulfill these purchase obligations  we would be only obligated to pay back the unearned upfront contract monies 
we also have made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond these commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain food distribution customer debt and lease obligations 
the following summarizes these commitments as of january  total commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments amounts committed less than year years years over years in thousands standby letters of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments letters of credit relate primarily to supporting workers compensation obligations and are renewable annually 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others under critical accounting policies  below  for additional information regarding debt  lease guarantees and assigned leases 
bank credit agreement our bank credit agreement has a five year term ending december  and provides a million term loan and million in revolving credit available for both revolving loans and up to million in letters of credit 
it represents one of our primary sources of liquidity  both short term and long term  and the continued availability of credit under that agreement is of material importance to our ability to fund our capital and working capital needs 
borrowings under the bank credit agreement bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin increase and a commitment commission on the unused portion of the revolver 
the margin increase and the commitment commission are reset quarterly based on movement of a leverage ratio defined by the agreement 
at january  the margin and commitment commission were and  respectively  compared to and at the end of fiscal the bank credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants  compliance with which is essential to continued credit availability under the credit agreement 
among the most significant of these restrictive covenants are financial covenants which require us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  and leverage 
these ratios are based on ebitda  on a rolling four quarter basis  with some adjustments consolidated ebitda 
consolidated ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is defined in our bank credit agreement as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude extraordinary gains or losses  gains or losses from sales of assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of business  and non cash lifo and other charges such as closed store lease costs and asset impairments  less subsequent cash payments made on non cash charges 
consolidated ebitda should not be considered an alternative measure of our net income  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
it is provided as additional information relative to compliance with our debt covenants 
as of january   we were in compliance with all consolidated ebitda based debt covenants as defined in our credit agreement which are summarized as follows financial covenant required ratio actual ratio interest coverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio minimum leverage ratio maximum ratio of consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters to interest expense for such period 
ratio of consolidated ebitda plus rent expense for the trailing four quarters to the sum of interest expense  rent expense and capital expenditures for such period 
the required minimum ratio per the credit agreement will be adjusted upward to as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal total outstanding debt and capitalized leases to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
any failure to comply with any of these financial covenants would  after the expiration of any applicable cure period  constitute an event of default under the bank credit agreement  entitling a majority of the bank lenders to  among other things  terminate future credit availability under the agreement and accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under that agreement

the bank credit agreement also contains covenants that limit the company s ability to incur debt including guaranteeing the debt of others and liens  acquire or dispose of assets  pay dividends on and repurchase its stock  make capital expenditures and make loans or advances to others  including customers 
defaults during on february  we were notified by the trustee for our million senior subordinated notes  due in that a default had occurred under the indenture as a result of our failure to file our form q for the third quarter ended october  with the sec and that  unless remedied within the day grace period  such failure would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
in addition  if the default was not remedied within the days  an event of default would also occur under our bank credit facility 
on february  we announced that holders of more than of our senior subordinated notes agreed to waive the default under the indenture 
the waiver required us to file our form q for the third fiscal quarter of by may  such holders also agreed to extend the time for us to file our form k for our fiscal year ended december  until may  and our form q for the first fiscal quarter ended march  until june  in consideration for the waiver  we paid a fee to the bondholders equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the notes 
we subsequently made the specified filings prior to the extended deadlines 
on march   we announced that the requisite number of bank lenders under our bank credit facility had agreed to extend until june  the deadline for submission to the lenders of our audited fiscal financial statements 
the bank credit agreement had originally called for us to provide to our lenders our audited financial statements for fiscal by march  in consideration for the amendment to the bank credit facility  we paid a fee to the bank lenders equal to of the sum of our revolving loan commitments and aggregate outstanding term loans as of the effective date of the amendment 
we subsequently submitted our audited financial statements prior to the extended deadline 
debt obligations generally for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flows  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair value as of january  fixed rate variable rate fair value amount rate fair value amount rate in thousands thereafter derivative instruments we have market risk exposure to changing interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements  to manage risk exposures when appropriate  based on market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading or other speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
deferred gains and losses are amortized as an adjustment to expense over the same period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in income 
however  to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the items being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately recognized in income 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
at january   we had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements which commenced on july   december  and june   respectively 
the agreements expire on september   october  and october  with notional amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
the three interest rate swap agreements described above total million in notional amounts  which are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract 
interest rate swap agreements outstanding at year end and their fair value at that date are summarized as follows in thousands pay fixed receive variable fair value average receive rate average pay rate off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this report  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions vendor allowances and credits we participate with our vendors in a broad menu of promotions to increase sales of products 
these promotions fall into two main categories off invoice allowances and performance based allowances 
these promotional arrangements are often subject to negotiation with our vendors 
in the case of off invoice allowances  discounts are typically offered by vendors with respect to certain merchandise purchased by us during a specified period of time 
we use off invoice allowances to support a variety of marketing programs such as reduced price offerings for specific time periods  food shows  pallet promotions and private label promotions 
the discounts are either reflected directly on the vendor invoice  as a reduction from the normal wholesale prices for merchandise to which the allowance applies  or we are allowed to deduct the allowance as an offset against the vendor s invoice when it is paid 
in the case of performance based allowances  the allowance or rebate is based on our completion of some specific activity  such as purchasing or selling product during a certain time period 
this basic performance requirement may be accompanied by an additional performance requirement such as providing advertising or special in store promotion  tracking quantities of product sold as is the case with count recount promotions discussed in part  item in this report under the caption count recount charges  slotting adding a new item to the system and merchandising a new item  or achieving certain minimum purchase quantities 
the billing for these performance based allowances is normally in the form of a bill back in which case we are invoiced at the regular price with the understanding that we may bill back the vendor for the requisite allowance when the performance is satisfied 
we collectively plan promotions with our vendors and arrive at the amount the respective vendor plans to spend on promotions with us 
we and the vendors then monitor  review and discuss the results of such promotions  and resolve issues relating to promotions and billings 
each vendor has its own method for determining the amount of promotional funds budgeted to be spent with us during the period 
in most situations  the vendor allowances are based on units we purchased from the vendor 
in other situations  the allowances are based on our past or anticipated purchases and or the anticipated performance of the planned promotions 
we jointly negotiate with our vendors the promotional calendar that governs all promotions 
forecasting promotional expenditures is a critical part of our twice yearly planning sessions with our vendors 
most vendors work with us to project not just overall spending  but also spending on a category and regional basis 
as individual promotions are completed and the associated billing is processed  the vendors track our promotional program execution and spend rate 
the vendors discuss the tracking  performance and spend rate with us on a regular basis throughout the year 
depending upon the vendor arrangements  such discussions can occur on a weekly  monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
these communications include future promotions  product cost  targeted retails and price points  anticipated volume  promotion expenditures  vendor maintenance  billing issues and procedures  new items discontinued items  and trade spend levels relative to budget per event and per year  as well as the resolution of any issues that arise between the vendor and us 
in the future  the nature and menu of promotional programs and the allocation of dollars among them may change as a result of ongoing negotiations and commercial relationships between vendors and the company 
eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  addresses how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from a vendor and how to measure that consideration in its income statement 
we early adopted the provisions of eitf no 
at the beginning of fiscal  and recognized a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  that represents the cumulative effect of the deferral of consideration received from vendors as of the beginning of fiscal excluding the cumulative impact  the adoption of eitf no 
on the year ended december  was a decrease in cost of sales of million 
as is common in our industry  we use a third party service to undertake accounts payable audits on an ongoing basis 
these audits examine vendor allowances offered to us during a given year as well as cash discounts  freight allowances and duplicate payments and establish a basis for us to recover overpayments made to vendors 
we reduce future payments to vendors based on the results of these audits  at which time we also establish reserves for commissions payable to the third party service provider as well as for amounts that may not be collected 
although our estimates of reserves do not anticipate changes in our historical payback rates  such changes could have a material impact on our currently recorded reserves 
customer exposure and credit risk allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we evaluate the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in determining the adequacy of the reserves  we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectibility based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note accounts and notes receivable of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these allowances 
lease commitments we have historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers  at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by us 
under terms of the original lease agreements  we remain primarily liable for any commitments an independent retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy 
we also lease store sites for our retail segment 
should a retailer be unable to perform under a sublease or should we close underperforming corporate stores  we record a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
calculating the estimated losses requires that significant estimates and judgments be made by management 
our reserves for such properties can be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested sublessees and their creditworthiness  our ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors  and general economic conditions and the demand for commercial property 
should the number of defaults by sublessees or corporate store closures materially increase  the remaining lease commitments we must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note leases of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain of our food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of january   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
we have also assigned various leases to certain food distribution customers 
if the assignees were to become unable to continue making payments under the assigned leases  we estimate our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases to be approximately million as of january  in circumstances when we become aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by us  we record a specific reserve in the amount we reasonably believe we will be obligated to pay on the customer s behalf  net of any anticipated recoveries from the customer 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we analyze factors such as those described above in allowance for doubtful accounts methodology and lease commitments 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not  however  result in cross default of our debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
estimates of future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we generally determine fair value by discounting expected future cash flows at the rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
reserves for self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general and automobile liability and health insurance costs 
it is our policy to record our self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
worker s compensation  general and automobile liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  general and automobile and health insurance liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
new accounting standards eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  addresses how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from a vendor and how to measure that consideration in its income statement 
in january  the eitf concluded that new arrangements  including modifications of existing arrangements entered into after december  should apply the treatment outlined in eitf no 
if determinable  pro forma disclosure of the impact of the consensus on prior periods presented is encouraged 
in march  the eitf concluded that entities may elect to early adopt the provisions of eitf no 
as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we elected in the fourth quarter of fiscal to early adopt the provisions of eitf no 
at the beginning of fiscal  and recognized a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  that represents the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of fiscal in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no

in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in activities on behalf of another company 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin no 
changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
on december   the fasb provided a revised interpretation on what constitutes a variable interest under fin no 
the fasb stated in the revised interpretation that an enterprise need not determine if an entity is a variable interest entity if the entity is a business as defined within eitf issue no 
 determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
as a result of the revised interpretation  the adoption of fin no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued revisions to sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revisions required changes to existing disclosures as well as new disclosures related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans

and incorporated them in our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary factors nash finch and its representatives may  from time to time  make written or oral forward looking statements relating to developments  results  conditions or other events that the company expects or anticipates will occur in the future 
these forward looking statements may involve a wide variety of topics  such as the company s future financial performance or condition  its strategies  market or economic conditions or the competitive environment 
any forward looking statements made are based on management s then current expectations and assumptions and  as a result  are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or conditions to differ materially from those predicted or projected 
the following cautionary factors are considered to be the more significant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted or projected by any forward looking statements  and are provided here as a readily available reference 
these factors are in addition to any other cautionary statements  written or oral  which may be made or referred to in connection with any forward looking statement  or contained elsewhere in this report 
competitive conditions the wholesale food distribution and food retailing businesses are intensely competitive  characterized by high inventory turnover  narrow profit margins and increasing consolidation 
our food retailing business  focused in the upper midwest  has historically competed with traditional grocery stores and is increasingly competing with alternative store formats such as supercenters  warehouse clubs  dollar stores and extreme value food stores 
our distribution business competes not only with local  regional and national food distributors  but also with vertically integrated national and regional chains that employ a variety of formats  including supercenters  supermarkets and warehouse clubs 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and may have greater financial resources and geographic scope  lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do  intensifying price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
industry consolidation and the expansion of alternative store formats  which have gained and continue to gain market share at the expense of traditional grocery stores  tend to produce even stronger competition for our food retail business and for the independent retailer customers of our distribution business 
to the extent our independent customers are acquired by our competitors or are not successful in competing with other retail chains and non traditional competitors  sales by our distribution business will also be affected 
if we fail to effectively implement strategies to respond to these competitive pressures  our operating results could be adversely affected by price reductions  decreased sales or margins  or loss of market share 
need to improve retail operations primarily due to the competitive conditions discussed above  same store sales in the company s retail business decreased in from  after having decreased in from the prior year 
we brought new leadership into the retail business in late with a view toward improving our response to and performance under these difficult competitive conditions 
it is expected that this effort will require a variety of initiatives of varying scope and duration 
in connection with such an undertaking there are numerous risks and uncertainties  including our ability to successfully identify those initiatives that will be the most effective in improving the competitive position of our retail business  our ability to efficiently and timely implement these initiatives  and the response of competitors to these initiatives 
if we are unable to improve the overall competitive position of our retail stores  the revenue and operating performance of that segment may continue to decline  and we may be compelled to close additional stores 
sensitivity to economic conditions the food distribution and retailing industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  particularly those that influence consumer confidence  spending and buying habits 
economic downturns or uncertainty may not only adversely affect overall demand and intensify price competition  but also cause consumers to trade down by purchasing lower priced  and often lower margin  items and to purchase less in traditional supermarket channels 
these consumer responses  coupled with the impact of general economic factors such as prevailing interest rates  food price inflation or deflation  employment trends in our markets  and labor and energy costs  can also have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
expansion and acquisition efforts to grow our retail and distribution businesses can include new store openings  new affiliations and acquisitions 
expansion is subject to a number of risks  including the adequacy of our capital resources  the availability of suitable real estate in target markets for store or distribution center sites and the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms  our understanding of the particular demands and preferences of market segments  and the ability to hire and train employees 
acquisitions entail certain additional risks such as identifying suitable candidates  effecting acquisitions at acceptable rates of return  timely and effectively integrating the operations  systems and personnel of the acquired business  and diversion of management s time and attention from other business concerns 
achieving growth in the distribution business increasing the growth and profitability of our distribution business is particularly dependent upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional distribution customers through our existing network of distribution centers  enabling us to more effectively utilize the fixed assets in that business 
our ability to achieve these goals is dependent  in part  upon our ability to continue to provide industry leading customer service  offer competitive products at low prices  maintain high levels of productivity and efficiency  particularly in the process of integrating new customers into our distribution system  and offer marketing  merchandising and ancillary services that provide value to our independent customers 
if we are unable to execute these tasks effectively  we may not be able to attract significant numbers of new customers and attrition among our existing customer base could increase  either or both of which could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 
customer credit risk in the ordinary course of business  we extend credit  including loans  to our food distribution customers  and provide financial assistance to some customers by guaranteeing their loan or lease obligations 
we also lease store sites for sublease to independent retailers 
generally  our loans and other financial accommodations are extended to small businesses that are unrated and may have limited access to conventional financing 
while we seek to obtain security interests and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations we extend  such collateral may not be sufficient to cover our exposure 
greater than expected losses from existing or future credit extensions  loans  guarantee commitments or sublease arrangements  particularly in times of economic difficulty or uncertainty  could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 
indebtedness and liquidity our current level of debt and covenants in the documents governing our outstanding debt could limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our ability to respond to market conditions and opportunities as well as capital needs could be constrained by the degree to which we are leveraged  by changes in the availability or cost of capital  and by contractual limitations on the degree to which we may  without the consent of our lenders  take actions such as engaging in mergers or acquisitions  incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures and making investments  loans or advances 
if needs or opportunities were identified that would require financial resources beyond existing resources  obtaining those resources could increase the company s borrowing costs  further reduce financial flexibility  require alterations in strategies and affect future operating results 
possible changes in military commissary system because our military food distribution segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries in the us and overseas  any material changes in the commissary system  in military staffing levels or in locations of bases may have a corresponding impact on the sales and operating performance of this segment 
these changes could include privatization of some or all of the military commissary system  relocation or consolidation in the number of commissaries  base closings or consolidations in the geographic areas containing commissaries served by us  or a reduction in the number of persons having access to the commissaries 
other factors other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted include changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations  issues affecting the food distribution and retail industry generally  such as food safety concerns  an increase in consumers eating away from home and the manner in which vendors target their promotional dollars  the ability to attract and retain qualified employees  unanticipated problems with product procurement  changes in vendor promotions or allowances  adverse determinations or developments with respect to litigation  other legal proceedings or the sec investigation of nash finch  the success or failure of new business ventures or initiatives  natural disasters and acts of terrorism 
the foregoing discussion of important factors is not exhaustive  and we do not undertake to revise any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statement is made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure in the financial markets consists of changes in interest rates relative to our investment in notes receivable  the balance of debt obligations outstanding  and derivatives employed from time to time to time to hedge long term variable interest rate debt 
we carry notes receivable because  in the normal course of business  we make long term loans to certain retail customers 
substantially all notes receivable are based on floating interest rates which adjust to changes in market rates 
as a result  the carrying value of notes receivable approximates market value
