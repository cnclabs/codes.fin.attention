subsequent to our announcement of unaudited results for the year ended january   the company determined that certain adjustments were needed in order to properly present the financial statements as a whole 
these adjustments reflect the effect of a minor difference in methodology in determining inventory valuation under the rim inventory method  reimbursement of cost incurred from a vendor in accordance with eitf  fiscal versus calendar year timing differences regarding vacation expense accrual  and a cost accrual timing error 
the company does not consider any one of these items alone to be material  but we believe that the adjustments are necessary in aggregate for a proper presentation of our financial statements 
the effect of these adjustments was a decrease in diluted earnings per share from 
to 
for the year ended january  critical accounting policies the preparation of fred s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments  can be found in note and the most critical accounting policies are as follows inventories warehouse inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the fifo first in  first out method 
retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate cost figures 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy inventories  which are  and  at january  and february   respectively  cost was determined using the lifo last in  first out method 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by approximately  at january  and  at february  the lifo reserve increased by   and  at january   february   and february   respectively 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  and depreciation is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold costs and improvements which are included in buildings and improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease terms 
average useful lives are as follows buildings and improvements to years  furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years 
amortization on equipment under capital leases is computed on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal 
vendor rebates and allowances 
the company receives vendor rebates for achieving certain purchase or sales volume and receives vendor allowances to fund certain expenses 
the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf is effective for arrangements with vendors initiated on or after january  eitf addresses the accounting and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor s products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor s products 
the eitf concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold  unless specific criteria are met qualifying the consideration for treatment as reimbursement of specific  identifiable incremental costs 
the provisions of this consensus have been applied prospectively 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements as a whole 
for vendor funding arrangements that were entered into prior to december  and have not been modified subsequently  the company recognizes a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses or cost of goods sold when earned 
if these arrangements are modified in the future  the provisions of eitf will apply and the effect may be material to the financial statements as a whole 
insurance reserves the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on known claims and estimates for incurred but not reported claims 
if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns  the company may be required to record additional expense or expense reductions which could be material to the company s financial statements as a whole
