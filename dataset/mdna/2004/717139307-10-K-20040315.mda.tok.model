critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to the tax valuation allowance and asset impairments to be critical policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
subsequent impairment assessments could result in future impairment charges 
any impairment charge would result in the reduction in the carrying value of long lived assets and would reduce our operating results in the period in which the charge arose 
tax valuation allowance the company has assessed the future taxable income and has determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made
