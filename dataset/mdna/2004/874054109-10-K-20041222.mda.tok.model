estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of prepaid royalties  capitalized software development costs and intangibles  inventories  realization of deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances for returns  price concessions and doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition in conjunction with the applicable provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue for software when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer exists  which is generally a customer purchase order  the software is delivered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable 
our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net and day terms 

back to index revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions 
in specific circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or are unable to determine that collection of receivables is probable  we defer the sale until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivables is probable 
allowances for returns and price concessions we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements 
following reductions in the price of our products  we grant price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them 
our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions  including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels 
our distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders 
however  we sometimes accept returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers  which includes credits and returns  when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 
we make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue 
we estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based upon  among other factors  historical experience  customer inventory levels  analysis of sell through rates  market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period 
we believe we can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions 
however  actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances  market conditions and assumptions 
adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
prepaid royalties our agreements with licensors and developers generally provide us with exclusive publishing rights and require us to make advance royalty payments that are recouped against royalties due to the licensor or developer based on contractual amounts on product sales  adjusted for certain costs 
prepaid royalties are amortized as cost of sales on a title by title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year sales to total of current and estimated future sales for that title or the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the respective agreements 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate the recoverability of prepaid royalties and charge to cost of sales the amount that management determines is probable that will not be recouped at the contractual royalty rate based on current and future sales in the period in which such determination is made or if we determine that we will cancel a development project 
prepaid royalties are classified as current and non current assets based upon estimated net product sales within the next year 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize internal software development costs  as well as film production and other content costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a title 
capitalized software development costs represent the costs associated with the internal development of our publishing products 
amortization of such costs as a component of cost of sales is recorded on a title by title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year sales to total of current and estimated future sales for the title or the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs based on undiscounted future cash flows and will charge to cost of sales any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable or for projects that we will abandon 
see note to consolidated financial statements 

back to index income taxes income tax assets and liabilities are determined by taxable jurisdiction 
we do not provide taxes on undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries 
the total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was approximately  for fiscal it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance 
accordingly  no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or united states income taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are paid as dividends to us 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends on whether we generate future taxable income of the appropriate type 
in addition  we may adopt tax planning strategies to realize these assets 
if future taxable income does not materialize or tax planning strategies are not effective  we may be required to record a valuation allowance

the increase in net sales was attributable to growth in our publishing business

we expect continued growth in our publishing business for fiscal publishing revenues in fiscal and include licensing revenues of  and  respectively 
products designed for video game console platforms accounted for of fiscal publishing revenues as compared to for fiscal products designed for pc platforms accounted for of fiscal publishing revenues as compared to for fiscal we anticipate that our platform mix will remain heavily weighted towards console platforms  but may fluctuate from period to period 
distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third party software titles  accessories and hardware 
the decrease in distribution revenues was attributable to lower playstation console hardware sales due to reduced availability in the market 
the lack of playstation hardware also resulted in fewer customer orders for playstation software 
in addition  we experienced lower sales of value priced product for the playstation  which is nearing the end of its hardware lifecycle 
these decreases were partially offset by growth in value and frontline software 
we expect that distribution operations will grow at a rate consistent with industry trends 
international operations accounted for approximately  or of net sales for fiscal compared to  or of net sales for fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to sales of grand theft auto san andreas for the playstation we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
higher foreign exchange rates benefited net sales by approximately cost of sales years ended october  of sales of sales increase incr product costs    royalties    software development costs    total cost of sales    product costs 
the increase in product costs was primarily attributable to higher costs associated with products designed for console platforms 
product costs increased as a percentage of sales due to a change in the mix of our publishing business  which reflected a smaller percentage of higher margin pc business compared to the prior year 
in addition  we also introduced sports titles at a value price point which resulted in a relatively low margin 
product costs for fiscal included a charge of  relating to the impairment of intangibles related to certain products in development 
royalties 
the increase in royalties was primarily due to third party royalties associated with sports titles and increased expenses related to a royalty program based on product sales for certain of our internal development personnel 

back to index software development costs 
software development costs increased due to the release of a greater number of internally developed titles during fiscal resulting in higher amortization of capitalized costs 
fiscal also includes a write off of  for a project that was abandoned during the year

operating expenses years ended october  of sales of sales increase decrease incr decr selling and marketing    general and administrative    research and development    depreciation and amortization   total operating expenses   selling and marketing 
the increase in selling and marketing expense was attributable to increased levels of advertising and promotional support for existing and new titles  specifically the espn sports titles  as well as higher personnel expenses  and is consistent with the growth of our business 
general and administrative 
the increase in general and administrative expense was principally attributable to higher professional fees and rent  partly offset by the absence of a fiscal charge of  associated with the consolidation of our distribution operations 
higher professional fees were incurred in connection with legal and regulatory matters and were partly offset by the reimbursement of of legal fees from insurance proceeds 
the increase in rent expense included costs associated with relocating a european office and additional space in our corporate offices 
research and development 
research and development costs increased primarily due to the acquisitions of development studios  as well as increased personnel costs 
once software development projects reach technological feasibility  which is relatively early in the development process  a substantial portion of our research and development costs are capitalized and subsequently amortized as cost of goods sold 
depreciation and amortization 
in fiscal  we incurred a  charge related to the impairment of a customer list from a previous acquisition as a result of the consolidation of our distribution operations 
excluding this fiscal charge  there was an increase in depreciation and amortization in fiscal principally due to higher depreciation related to the build out of our corporate offices and the implementation of software systems

the fiscal tax provision included the effect of a valuation allowance against capital loss and other carryforwards increase to the effective tax rate partially offset by eti decrease to the effective tax rate 

back to index at october   we had capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately  the capital loss carryforwards will expire in the periods fiscal through fiscal management does not expect to generate sufficient taxable income from capital transactions prior to the expiration of these benefits  and accordingly a valuation allowance was recorded in fiscal for this asset as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to these carryforwards will not be realized 
at october   we had foreign net operating losses of approximately  expiring between and  and state net operating losses of approximately  expiring between and if these losses are determined to not be utilizable prior to expiration  additional valuation allowances may need to be recorded in future periods 
recently enacted legislation generally provides that the eti benefit described above will be reduced by in and in  and will be eliminated in its entirety in  which may result in higher future effective tax rates 
although this legislation also provides for future phased in deductions for qualifying domestic production activities  we are presently unable to determine whether we will be able to realize any benefit from this provision 
in addition  the legislation makes available a one time tax reduction with respect to repatriated foreign earnings through we do not believe that this provision will provide a material benefit to us 
we are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes

the decrease in the allowance as a percentage of gross receivables was primarily the result of sales from a major product release on which lower allowances were required 
we had accounts receivable days outstanding of days for the three months ended october   as compared to days for the three months ended october  receivable days outstanding increased primarily as a result of the significant amount of sales of a major product release at year end 
our receivable days outstanding fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of product releases 
generally  we have been able to collect our receivables in the ordinary course of business 
we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers and our receivables are generally not covered by insurance 
as a result  we are subject to credit risks  particularly in the event that any of the receivables represent a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets

international operations sales in international markets  principally in the united kingdom and other countries in europe  have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
for fiscal and  sales in international markets accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales 
we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade  including increased credit risks  tariffs and duties  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  shipping delays and international political  regulatory and economic developments  all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results 
risk factors the market for our titles is characterized by short product life cycles 
the market for our titles is characterized by short product life cycles and frequent introductions of new products 
new products introduced by us may not achieve significant market acceptance or achieve sufficient sales to permit us to recover development  manufacturing and marketing costs 
the life cycle of a game generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a decline in sales  although sales of certain products may extend for significant periods of time  including through our election to participate in sony s greatest hits and microsoft s platinum hits programs 
because revenues associated with the initial shipments of a new product generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a product  any delay in the introduction of one or more new products could adversely affect our operating results for particular periods 
if we introduce a relatively limited number of new products in any period  the failure of one or more of our products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect our operating results 

back to index a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a limited number of titles 
for the year ended october   our ten best selling titles accounted for approximately of our revenues  with grand theft auto san andreas for the playstation accounting for of our revenues  grand theft auto double pack for the xbox accounting for of our revenues  grand theft auto vice city for playstation accounting for of our revenues  max payne the fall of max payne for playstation accounting for of our revenues  and manhunt for playstation accounting for of our revenues 
for the year ended october   our ten best selling titles accounted for approximately of our revenues  with grand theft auto vice city for playstation accounting for of our revenues  midnight club for playstation accounting for of our revenues  and grand theft auto vice city for pc accounting for of our revenues 
for the year ended october   our ten best selling titles accounted for approximately of our revenues 
if we fail to continue to develop and sell new  commercially successful titles  our revenues and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal  with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter our fourth and first fiscal quarters  due primarily to the increased demand for games during the holiday buying season 
our failure or inability to introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand will harm our business and operating results 
these fluctuations could also cause our stock price to decline 
other factors that cause fluctuations include delays in the introduction of new titles  the size and timing of product and business acquisitions  variations in sales of titles designed to operate on particular platforms  development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles  availability of hardware platforms  the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors  product returns and price concessions  and the timing of orders from major customers 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales and therefore our operating results would be harmed by a decrease in sales or a failure to meet our sales expectations 
the uncertainties associated with interactive entertainment software development  manufacturing lead times  production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 
in future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock could significantly decline 
our business is cyclical  and we may fail to anticipate changing consumer preferences 
our business is subject to all of the risks generally associated with the interactive entertainment software industry  which has been cyclical in nature and has been characterized by periods of significant growth followed by rapid declines 
our future operating results will depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including the popularity  price and timing of new software and hardware platforms being released and distributed by us and our competitors  international  national and regional economic conditions  particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary consumer spending  war  acts of terrorism and military action  which could adversely affect consumer preferences in entertainment  changes in consumer demographics  the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment  and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences  all of which change rapidly and cannot be predicted 
in order to plan for acquisition and promotional activities  we must anticipate and respond to rapid changes in consumer tastes and preferences 
a decline in the popularity of interactive entertainment software or particular platforms could cause sales of our titles to decline dramatically 
the period of time necessary to develop new game titles  obtain approvals of manufacturers and produce finished products is unpredictable 
during this period  consumer appeal for a particular title may decrease  causing product sales to fall short of expectations 

back to index rapidly changing technology and platform shifts could hurt our operating results 
the interactive entertainment industry in general is associated with rapidly changing technology 
as more advanced platforms achieve market acceptance  consumer demand for software for older platforms declines 
we are continuing to devote significant development resources primarily on products designed for sony s playstation and microsoft s xbox 
if consumer demand for these platforms declines generally or as a result of the next hardware transition cycle  we may experience lower than expected sales or losses from products designed for these platforms 
we also have begun to devote significant development resources on products designed for next generation hardware platforms  initially for microsoft s xbox it is difficult to anticipate hardware development cycles and we must make software development commitments and investment decisions well in advance of the introduction of new hardware platforms 
if new hardware platforms are delayed or do not achieve consumer acceptance  we may not be able to recover our investments and our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed or are currently developing software for use by consumers over the internet 
future increases in the availability of such software or technological advances in such software or the internet could result in a decline in platform based software and impact our sales 
direct sales of software by major publishers over the internet would materially adversely affect our distribution business 
our expansion into the market for sports and other licensed titles may not be successful 
we are seeking to diversify our product offerings by capitalizing on significant growth opportunities in the market for sports and other licensed action and strategy titles 
our success in this market will depend in part on our ability to attract licensors with popular properties and to enter into favorable arrangements with these licensors  including with licensors representing the major sports leagues and players associations 
competition for sports and other licensed properties is intense 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses to popular properties  our revenue and profitability with respect to these products could decline dramatically 
competition for these licenses also may increase advances and royalties payable to licensors 
we may be unable to enter into favorable license agreements  and our efforts to diversify our product offerings may not result in increased revenues or profitability 
our business is dependent on publishing arrangements with third parties 
our success depends on our ability to identify and develop new titles on a timely basis 
we have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software 
these agreements typically require us to make advance payments  pay royalties and satisfy other conditions 
our advance payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully 
software development costs  promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers have increased significantly in recent years  and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software 
we expect that the costs associated with the development of next generation software will increase significantly 
future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover advances to software developers  and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments 
if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with third party developers  the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that may be burdensome to us 
returns of our published titles and price concessions may adversely affect our operating results 
we are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers 
our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders 
however  we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers which include credits and returns  when demand for specific products falls below expectations 
we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements 
revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions 
we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions 
however  if return rates and price concessions for our published titles exceed our reserves  our revenues will decline 

back to index the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 
we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony  microsoft and nintendo  each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms 
each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns  particularly for prime time television spots 
these companies may also increase their own software development efforts or focus on developing software products for third party platforms 
we also compete with domestic companies such as electronic arts  activision  thq  midway games and atari and international companies such as sega  vivendi  ubi soft  eidos  capcom  konami and namco 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  personnel and other resources than we do  and are able to carry larger inventories and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties than we can 
our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures  television and audio and video products featuring similar themes  online computer programs and forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 
our distribution business also operates in a highly competitive environment 
the intense competition that characterizes our industry is based primarily on breadth  availability and quality of product lines  price  terms and conditions of sale  credit terms and availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  and effectiveness of sales and marketing programs 
our competitors include regional  national and international distributors  as well as hardware manufacturers and software publishers 
we may lose market share or be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to the actions of our competitors  and thereby experience a reduction in our gross margins 
increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 
retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources  and competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 
competition for retail shelf space is expected to increase  which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain current levels of sales of our titles 
competitors with more extensive lines and popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers 
accordingly  we may not be able to achieve the levels of promotional support and shelf space that such competitors receive 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales 
sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately and of our revenues  respectively  for the years ended october  and for the year ended october   sales of our products to wal mart accounted for of our revenues 
our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without long term agreements or other commitments 
our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time 
the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers could harm our operating results 
bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could also seriously hurt our business 
we are subject to credit and collection risks 
our sales are typically made on credit 
we do not hold any collateral to secure payment by our customers 
as a result  we are subject to credit risks  particularly in the event that any of our receivables represent sales to a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets 
although we continually assess the creditworthiness of our customers  which are principally large  national retailers  if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due  it could adversely affect our financial condition 
rating systems for interactive entertainment software  potential legislation and consumer opposition could inhibit sales of our products 
trade organizations within the video game industry require interactive entertainment software publishers to provide consumers with information relating to graphic violence  profanity or sexually explicit material contained in software titles  and impose penalties for noncompliance 
certain countries have also established similar rating systems as prerequisites for sales of interactive entertainment software in such countries 
in some instances  we may be required to modify our products to comply with the requirements of such rating systems  which could delay the release of those products in such countries 
our software titles receive a rating of e age and older  t age and over or m age and over 
most of our new titles including our grand theft auto titles  max payne the fall of max payne  manhunt and mafia have received an m rating 
we believe that we comply with such rating systems and properly display the ratings and content descriptions received for our titles 

back to index several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate the interactive entertainment software  motion picture and recording industries  including a proposal to adopt a common rating system for interactive entertainment software  television and music containing violence or sexually explicit material  and the federal trade commission has issued reports with respect to the marketing of such material to under audiences 
consumer advocacy groups have also opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material by pressing for legislation in these areas including legislation prohibiting the sale of certain m rated video games to under audiences and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns 
retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material  which may limit the potential market for our m rated products  and adversely affect our operating results 
if any groups including international  national and local political and regulatory bodies were to target our m rated titles  we might be required to significantly change or discontinue a particular title  which in the case of our best selling titles could seriously hurt our business 
although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have been unsuccessful  a claim of this kind has been asserted against us 
we cannot publish our console titles without the approval of hardware manufacturers 
we are required to obtain a license from sony  microsoft and nintendo  our principal competitors  to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms 
our existing hardware console platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a title by title basis 
as a result  the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms  along with our ability to time the release of these titles and  accordingly  our net sales from titles for these hardware platforms  may be limited 
if any manufacturer chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term  or if the manufacturer were to terminate our license for any reason  we would be unable to publish additional titles for that manufacturer s hardware platform 
termination of any such agreements would seriously hurt our business 
license agreements relating to these rights generally extend for a term of three or four years and are automatically renewable for successive one year terms 
the agreements are terminable upon the occurrence of a number of factors  including breach of the agreement by us  our bankruptcy or insolvency  or our entry into a relationship with  or acquisition by  a competitor of the manufacturer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new or maintain existing licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
sony and nintendo are the sole manufacturers of the titles we publish under license from them 
games for the xbox must be manufactured by pre approved manufacturers 
each platform license provides that the manufacturer may raise prices for the titles at any time and grants the manufacturer substantial control over the release of new titles 
each of these manufacturers also publishes software for its own platforms and manufactures titles for all of its other licensees and may choose to give priority to its own titles or those of other publishers if it has insufficient manufacturing capacity or if there is increased demand for its or other publishers products 
in addition  these manufacturers may not have sufficient production capacity to satisfy our scheduling requirements during any period of sustained demand 
if manufacturers do not supply us with finished titles on favorable terms without delays  our operations would be materially interrupted  and we would be unable to obtain sufficient amounts of our product to sell to our customers 
if we cannot obtain sufficient product supplies  our net sales will decline and we could incur losses 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights or avoid claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties 
we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright  trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure  copying and distribution 
our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying 
unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary 
well organized piracy operations have proliferated in recent years as a result of the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet 
although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software  piracy of our products could negatively impact our future profitability 
as the amount of interactive entertainment software titles in the market increases and the functionality of this software further overlaps  we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes the copyrights or patents of others 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights 
although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of third party developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others  it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others has or may occur 
any claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming  costly and difficult to defend 
moreover  intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products  obtain a license or redesign our products  which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

back to index we are dependent on third party software developers to complete certain of our titles 
we rely on third party software developers for the development of certain of our titles 
quality third party developers are continually in high demand 
software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future 
due to the limited number of third party software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them  these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards  if at all 
we depend on third party software developers and our internal development studios to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections 
the development cycle for new titles ranges from twelve to twenty four months 
after development of a product  it may take between nine to twelve additional months to develop the product for other hardware platforms 
if developers experience financial difficulties  additional costs or unanticipated development delays  we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule 
our software is susceptible to errors  which can harm our financial results and reputation 
the technological advancements of new hardware platforms allow for more complex software products 
as software products become more complex  the risk of undetected errors in products when first introduced increases 
if  despite testing  errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made  we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance  product returns  loss of revenues and damage to our reputation 
gross margins relating to our distribution business have been historically narrow which increases the impact of variations in costs on our operating results 
as a result of intense price competition  our gross margins in our distribution business have historically been narrow and may continue to be narrow in the future 
accordingly  slight variations in operating costs and expenses could result in losses in our distribution business from period to period 
we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 
a significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is comprised of personnel and facilities 
in the event of a significant decline in net sales  we may not be able to exit facilities  reduce personnel  or make other significant changes to our cost structure without significant disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs 
management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner  if at all  to offset an immediate shortfall in net sales and gross profit 
our distribution business is dependent on suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis 
our ability to obtain particular products in required quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success 
in most cases  we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with suppliers 
in certain product categories  limited price concessions or return rights offered by publishers may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing to purchase 
our industry may experience significant hardware supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain manufacturers to supply certain products on a timely basis 
as a result  we have experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  short term hardware inventory shortages 
in addition  manufacturers or publishers who currently distribute their products through us may decide to distribute  or to substantially increase their existing distribution  through other distributors  or directly to retailers 
we are subject to the risk that our inventory values may decline and protective terms under supplier arrangements may not adequately cover the decline in values 
the interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry standards 
these changes may cause inventory to decline substantially in value or to become obsolete 
we are also exposed to inventory risk in our distribution business to the extent that supplier price concessions are not available on all products or quantities and are subject to time restrictions 
in addition  suppliers may become insolvent and unable to fulfill price concession obligations 

back to index we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade 
sales in international markets  primarily in the united kingdom and other countries in europe  have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
sales in international markets accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues for fiscal and we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade  including increased credit risks  tariffs and duties  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  shipping delays  and international political  regulatory and economic developments  all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results 
all of our international sales are made in local currencies 
the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
factors such as our operating results  announcements by us or our competitors and various factors affecting the interactive entertainment software industry may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to rapidly evolving regulation affecting financial reporting  accounting and corporate governance matters 
in response to recent corporate events  legislators and government agencies have focused on the integrity of financial reporting  and regulatory accounting bodies have recently announced their intention to issue several new accounting standards  including accounting for stock options as compensation expense  certain of which are significantly different from current accounting standards 
we cannot predict the impact of the adoption of any such proposals on our future financial results 
additionally  recently enacted legislation focused on corporate governance  auditing and internal accounting controls imposes compliance burdens on us  and will require us to devote significant financial  technical and personnel resources to address compliance issues 
we are dependent on our management and key personnel 
we rely on our management and other key personnel for the successful operation of our business 
we are dependent upon the expertise and skills of certain of our rockstar employees responsible for content creation and product development and marketing 
although we have employment agreements with each of these creative  development and marketing personnel  and we have granted them incentives in the form of an internal royalty program based on sales of rockstar published products  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels  or at all 
failure to continue to attract and retain qualified management  creative  development  financial  marketing  sales and technical personnel could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business  primarily risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
historically  fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant impact on our operating results 
at october   we had no outstanding variable rate indebtedness 
we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant fiscal quarter or year end 
translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
for fiscal our foreign currency translation adjustment gain was  and our foreign exchange transaction gain was  a hypothetical change in applicable currency exchange rates at october  would result in a material translation adjustment
