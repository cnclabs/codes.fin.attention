in the md a and other sections that follow there will be references to the mod contract 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a contract to provide the united kingdom ministry of defense mod with software  support and services 
this contract generated of revenue in in january  the mod announced it was suspending all work on the contract due to budgetary constraints 
as a result of this suspension  the company engaged in a significant restructuring effort in an attempt to right size its work force and facilities 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  
table of contents revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and intangibles and restructuring 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following policies as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of the company s results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these policies and the disclosures below with the audit committee of the board of directors 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies continue to evolve 
they are very complex and often subject to interpretation 
very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue are followed  however  certain judgments affect the application of the company s revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
revenue arises from two sources a software license fees and b services 
software license fees are generated from licensing the rights to use indus software products 
services revenue is generated from sales of customer support services maintenance contracts  consulting and implementation services  outsourcing  hosting services and training services for customers that license the company s products 
for license arrangements that do not require modification of the software  revenue is recognized in accordance with accounting standards for software companies  including statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended or interpreted by sop and sop  technical practice aids  and sec staff accounting bulletins 
license fee revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement becomes effective as evidenced by a signed contract  product delivery  a fixed or determinable license fee and probability of collection 
if the license fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if a nonstandard acceptance period is provided  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
in arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  the total arrangement fee is allocated among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements may consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  hosting and consulting services 
vsoe is based on the price generally charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change when the element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for an undelivered element  the total arrangement fee will be taken to revenue over the life of the contract 
revenue from consulting and implementation services is generally time and material based and is recognized as the work is performed 
delays in project implementation will result in delays in revenue recognition 
some professional consulting services involve fixed price and or fixed time arrangements and are recognized using contract accounting  which requires the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized on the percentage of completion method  with progress to completion measured by using specific milestones  usually labor cost inputs  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
project losses are 
table of contents provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future consulting margins on these projects may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
revenue from maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract  typically one year 
revenue from outsourcing and web hosting also referred to as asp or application service provider services is recognized based upon contractually agreed upon rates per user or service  over a contractually defined time period 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts billed and unbilled accounts receivable are credit based 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is formula based  supplemented by an evaluation of specific accounts where there may be collectibility risk 
if the methodology the company uses to calculate this allowance does not properly reflect future collections  revenue could be overstated or understated 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based upon historical collections and an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balance s  evaluation of the account s financial condition  recent payment history  and discussions with the company s account executive for the specific customer 
based upon this evaluation of collectibility  any increase or decrease required in the allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a change is necessary 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
the reduction in the allowance from march  to march  is due to the write off to the allowance of invoices related to a specific customer dispute and improved collections efforts in the amount written off was fully included in the march  allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company generates a significant portion of revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to companies in the utility industry 
as of march   approximately million  or  of the company s gross billed accounts receivable were attributable to software license fees and services sales to utility customers 
in determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  the company has considered the financial condition of the utility industry as a whole  as well as the financial condition of individual utility customers 
while the utility industry customers served by the company are generally in the regulated or retail sector  their unregulated affiliated activities might affect the ability to collect amounts due 
the credit status of customers is monitored and  where deemed necessary  a provision is made for potential uncollectibility 
the company generated of its revenues in the year ended march  from a single customer  magnox electric plc  located in the united kingdom 
as of march   approximately million  or  of the company s accounts receivable were attributable to this customer 
the company does not anticipate accounts receivable collectibility issues related to this customer s account 
revenue from sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar resulted in approximately million of the company s march  gross billed accounts receivable being denominated in foreign currencies  of which approximately million were denominated in british pounds 
historically  the foreign currency gains and losses on these receivables have not been significant  and the company has determined that foreign currency derivative products are not required to hedge the company s exposure 
if the value of the us dollar significantly declined versus one or more foreign currencies  the us dollar equivalents received from the company s customers could be significantly less than the march  reported amount

table of contents valuation of intangible assets and goodwill the acquisition of indus utility systems  inc ius formerly sct utility systems  inc in march and wishbone systems in january resulted in the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired  as well as other definite lived intangible assets 
under present accounting rules sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  instead it is subject to impairment testing criteria 
other acquired definite lived intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  although those with indefinite lives are not to be amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment  using a lower of cost or fair value approach 
for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing  the company considers itself to be a single reporting unit and assesses goodwill impairment on an enterprise wide level 
the impairment test is therefore performed on a consolidated basis and compares the company s market capitalization reporting unit fair value to its outstanding equity reporting unit carrying value 
in accordance with the recommended provisions of sfas no 
 the company utilizes its closing stock price as reported on the nasdaq national market on the date of the impairment test in order to compute market capitalization 
the company has designated december as the annual date for impairment testing 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december  and concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed since the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
no events have occurred  nor circumstances changed subsequent to december   that would reduce the fair value of the company s reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would indicate the possibility of impairment 
the impairment review may require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about the company s operating performance 
if such a review indicates that the assets are impaired  an expense would be recorded for the amount of the impairment  and the corresponding impaired assets would be reduced in carrying value 
differences in the identification of reporting units and the use of valuation techniques can result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
restructuring the company has accrued the cost of redundant leased office space in san francisco  dallas and pittsburgh through restructuring charges in the period january  through march  the accrual is included in the consolidated financial statements in other accrued liabilities for amounts due within one year and other liabilities for amounts due after one year 
the redundant office space was a result of the company s relocation of its headquarters and certain administrative functions from san francisco to atlanta in and  and the suspension of the united kingdom ministry of defense contract in additions to the accrual were made in the year of  the three month period ended march  and the year ended march  due to additional vacated office space and the deterioration of the rental markets in all three locations 
this deterioration has resulted in the company receiving less than anticipated amounts in sublease arrangements due to lower lease rates and longer times taken to sublease the office space 
the company reviews this accrual and evaluates its adequacy on an ongoing basis 
should rental conditions deteriorate to the point where the redundant office space is not ever leased  the company will incur additional charges totaling approximately million over the period from fiscal year through should rental conditions improve  it is possible that higher than anticipated sublease income will be generated 
any required increase or decrease in this accrual will be reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a change is necessary 
in may  the company announced its plan to restructure certain business activities and record restructuring charges of up to million in the first quarter of fiscal  as well as some incremental charges resulting from this restructuring plan in future periods 
of this amount  approximately million relates to the consolidation of office space in atlanta and san francisco  including the transfer of functions to the company owned office buildings in columbia  south carolina 
the remaining restructuring charge is 
table of contents related to severance costs associated with the elimination of approximately positions  resulting from the outsourcing of some development functions to india and consolidating other business functions 
the resultant income statement savings is expected to lower the company s breakeven point and strengthen the company s ability to remain profitable in the future 
results of operations operating results in fiscal  the company achieved operational growth from the march acquisition of ius 
the operations of indus and ius were combined in the succeeding months  with a merger of the ius corporate subsidiary into indus occurring in november during the period since acquisition  many of the operations of indus and ius have been combined in such a manner that it is not always practicable to attribute and or quantify variances specific to either entity in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  in january  the company acquired the operations of wishbone systems to expand the company s product offerings into a comprehensive suite of service delivery management applications 
wishbone system s operations had an insignificant impact on the company s operations in fiscal in march  the company changed its fiscal year end from december to march the following discussion of historical operating results compares the fiscal year ended march  to the same twelve month period in the prior year 
results from the twelve month period ended march  were derived from the company s published quarterly results and are unaudited 
accordingly  this twelve month period is not disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
it is included in this discussion for comparative purposes only

the increase in total revenue is principally attributable to revenue generated by the ius business acquired in march  although the merger of the operation makes quantifying the actual amounts fully attributable to the ius operations impracticable 
not withstanding the increase in revenue in fiscal year  the company continues to experience some effects from a weakened spending environment for information technology in the form of deferred buying decisions by customers for major software and services purchases and pressures from customers and competitors to discount offerings 
software license fees the increase in revenue from software license fees in the year ended march  is attributable to the increase in new license arrangements during the current year and the recognition of million in revenue  deferred from periods prior to the beginning of the year  where the criteria for revenue recognition was met during the current year 

table of contents the aggregate dollar totals of new license arrangements increased to million in the twelve month period ended march  from million for the same period of license fee revenue from the crm software suites was million for the year ended march  all of the license fee revenue for the prior year period was derived from eam software  because the crm software was acquired in the ius acquisition and no crm related license revenue was recorded in the twelve month period ended march  support  outsourcing and hosting revenues from support  outsourcing and hosting increased in the period due to a million growth in hosting revenue  million from the inclusion of the outsourcing business and increased customer support from the ius business acquired in march consulting  training and other the increase in revenue from consulting  training and other is attributable to the inclusion of million from the ius business in this revenue was offset by the decline in the company s eam consulting business resulting from lower levels of new license bookings in fiscal and into  which directly impacted consulting services  and the winding down of several significant projects

gross profits on license fees are substantially higher than gross profits on services revenue  due to the relatively high personnel costs associated with the various services 
the company has not yet begun to amortize the capitalized costs of internally developed software 
cost of revenue software license fees the decrease in cost of software license fees in the year ended march  as compared to the same twelve month period of was due to third party software write downs in the period and a product mix in the period in which license fee revenue recognized was less dependent on third party products than in the period 
in the period  third party software of  was written off to adjust the balances of third party software licenses to reflect the anticipated use over the remaining lives of the licenses 
cost of services customer support  outsourcing and hosting the increase in cost of customer support  outsourcing and hosting is attributable to the inclusion of the ius business for the entire period 
prior to the acquisition of ius  the company did not offer outsourcing services  which represent million of the cost increase in year ended march  the increase in the cost of hosting services of million corresponds with the company s growth in hosting revenues 
cost of services consulting  training and other consulting  training and other services costs increased as a result of the inclusion of the ius business 
gross margin on consulting  training and other services decreased from for the twelve month period ended march  to for the year ended 
table of contents march  due to lower staff utilization and the inclusion of the ius business  which has lower margins in its consulting services 
operating expenses twelve months ended change unaudited in thousands research and development percentage of total revenue sales and marketing percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue restructuring expense percentage of total revenue total operating expense research and development research and development expenses comprise personnel and related costs  computer processing costs and third party consultant fees attributable to the development of new software application products and enhancements to existing products 
computer software development costs are charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established  after which remaining software production costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release 
the company defines technological feasibility as the point in time at which it has a detailed program design or a working model of the product  depending on the type of development effort 
until  no research and development costs were capitalized because the costs between attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date of general release were insignificant 
the reduction in research and development expense in the year ended march  was a result of staffing reductions and capitalization of internal development costs of million 
capitalized development costs are related to creating a version of the passport product to meet market requirements in japan and other asian countries 
these costs have not yet been subject to amortization as the product just became generally available at the end of march the company will amortize these capitalized costs to cost of license fee revenue beginning in the first quarter of fiscal sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  sales commissions  and the costs of advertising  public relations and participation in industry conferences and trade shows 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was due to an increased sales force  including those sales and marketing employees of the ius and wishbone systems businesses  which are included in the period  and greater incentive compensation based on a higher level of sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include the costs of finance  human resources and administrative operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of the ius business 
additionally  the year ended march  includes million in amortization of intangible assets as compared to million for the same twelve month period in restructuring expenses the company recorded million in restructuring charges in the twelve month period ended march  the restructuring charges resulted from changes in the company s estimates of excess lease costs associated with the subleasing of redundant office space in san francisco  dallas and pittsburgh

the decrease in interest income is a result of a decrease in the average cash balances available for investment for the period and lower market interest rates 
interest expense is related to debt financing used to fund the march  ius acquisition and capital lease arrangements 
in connection with the acquisition of ius  the company executed a promissory note in the principal amount of million in favor of sct financial corporation  a subsidiary of systems computer technology corporation  secured by a mortgage on ius real property 
this note was paid in full on september  with proceeds from an million mortgage on the same property 
at the time of the acquisition  the company also issued convertible notes which were converted to common stock on july  as a result of this activity  interest expense increased from  for the twelve month period ended march  to million for the year ended march  other income expense other income expense is generated from foreign exchange gains or losses 
foreign exchange gains in the twelve month period ended march  were  compared with  in gains for the same period of this variance reflects the recent decline in the value of the us dollar and its impact on the company s us subsidiaries holding us dollar cash and receivable balances and revaluation of certain intercompany balances between the parent company and one of its non us subsidiaries 
provision for income taxes income taxes include federal  state and foreign income taxes 
in the twelve month period ended march   the company recorded a net tax benefit of million to reflect the impact of a change to us federal income tax law allowing the carryback of net operating losses for five years rather that two years permitted under previous law
