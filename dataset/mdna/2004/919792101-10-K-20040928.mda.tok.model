item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview valley is a leading packager and distributor of industrial  medical and specialty gases  welding equipment and supplies and propane in states in the eastern united states 
valley s net sales have grown  primarily as a result of acquisitions  at a compound annual rate of approximately per year since valley started business in  increasing from  in that year to million in fiscal in fiscal  gases accounted for approximately of net sales  welding equipment and supplies accounted for approximately of net sales  while cylinder rental  tank rental  delivery charges and compliance charges accounted for approximately of net sales 
valley believes it has been successful in executing its strategy of growth through acquisitions  having completed acquisitions since some acquisitions have had  and valley expects that some future acquisitions will have  a dilutive effect upon valley s income from operations and income before tax for a short period following consummation 
this temporary dilution occurs because some of the benefits of acquisitions  such as leveraging of operating and administrative expenses  improved product gross margins and real sales growth  occur over a period ranging from two to eight quarters  depending upon the complexity of integrating each acquisition into valley s existing operations 
the consideration for most acquisitions includes a combination of a cash payment at closing  seller financing and payments under covenants not to compete and consulting agreements 
in most cases  operating cash flow of an acquired business is positive in a relatively short period of time 
for many acquisitions  valley believes that projections of future cash flows justify payment of amounts in excess of the book or market value of the assets acquired  resulting in goodwill being recorded 
valley s results are subject to moderate seasonality  primarily due to fluctuations in the demand for propane  which is highest during winter months falling in valley s second and third fiscal quarters 
seasonality of total sales has increased as propane sales have increased as a percentage of total sales 
operating and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries  benefits  transportation equipment operating costs  facility lease expenses and general office expenses 
these expenses are generally fixed on a quarter to quarter basis 
valley believes that changes in these expenses as a percentage of sales should be evaluated over the long term rather than on a quarter to quarter basis due to the moderate seasonality of sales mentioned above and the generally fixed nature of these expenses 
historically  valley s gross profit margins as a percentage of sales have been higher on the sale of gases than on the sale of welding equipment and supplies 
future acquisitions may affect valley s gross profit margins as a percentage of sales depending upon the product mix of the acquired businesses 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in valley s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends 
as of march   valley consolidated variable interest entities as required under fin r 
accordingly  fiscal results include three months of operations of these entities 
it is anticipated that fiscal will include twelve months operations of these entities 
as a percentage of net sales years ended june net sales cost of products sold  excluding depreciation and amortization gross profit operating and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense other income earnings before minority interest minority interest earnings before taxes provision for income taxes net earnings comparison of years ended june  and net sales increased  or million  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  acquisitions made during the preceding twelve months contributed million of the increase in net sales for the year ended june   while same store sales increased million or for such twelve month period 
propane sales increased million on a same store basis compared to the prior year period  reflecting million in price inflation and million increase due to increase in the volume of propane sold 
same store bulk propane gallons sold were down for the year reflecting reduced demand due to warmer than average temperatures as compared to the prior period 
sales of hard goods decreased million from the prior year on a same store basis  reflecting the effect of the decline in the economy during the period and valley s decision to reduce activity with selective low margin accounts 
gases and cylinder revenue represented of net sales for the year ended june   with hard goods representing 
in comparison  gases and cylinder revenue represented of net sales for the year ended june   with hard goods representing gross profit  which excludes depreciation and amortization  increased  or million  to million  for the year ended june   as compared to for the year ended june  acquisitions made since the prior year contributed million of increase in gross profit while same store gross profit increased by million 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june   primarily reflecting improvements in gross profits for hard goods as average price realization increased and the non recurrence of a charge of million for disposal of slow moving hardgoods inventory in the fiscal year ended june  valley believes that these results reflect its efforts to implement a more standardized pricing policy for its products and services 
operating and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended june  approximately million of this decrease is due to a net reduction in expenses resulting from the consolidation under fin r  of variable interest entities owned by a related party that leases property to valley 
in addition  this reduction reflected  primarily  the results of valley s cost reduction initiatives and was partially offset by the cancellation of related party lease obligations of million 
the majority of these expense reductions were in the areas of wages  benefits  legal  professional and other general expenses 
lastly  the fiscal year results included charges associated with valley s repositioning and strengthening program totaling million for the year 
operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were for the year ended june   as compared to for the year ended june  depreciation and amortization expense decreased million for the year ended june   as compared to the year ended june   primarily as a result of certain intangibles becoming fully amortized  partially offset by depreciation expense related to the variable interest entities which totaled million during the three months since the march  consolidation 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the year ended june   reflecting primarily the effect of reduced outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates due to improved financial performance 
included in interest expense was a decrease of  and  for the years ended june  and june   respectively  to record changes in the fair market value of valley s interest rate swap agreements under sfas no 
interest expense also included related to the variable interest entities since the march  consolidation 
other income increased million year to date  as compared to prior year comparable periods primarily due to income earned by the variable interest entities which was not related to the leasing of properties to valley 
minority interest earnings reflect the elimination of net pre tax income earned during the quarter by the variable interest entities since valley has no direct ownership interest in these entities 
the amount eliminated is primarily the reduction in rent expense and other income noted above  partially offset by expenses incurred by the entities 
the company s effective tax rate decreased from for the prior year to for the current year due to a tax benefit of approximately million relating to the donation of inventory to a qualified charitable entity  which resulted in a tax deduction for the fair market value of the inventory 
for the reasons state above  net income increased to million for the year ended june   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  diluted earnings per share were for fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year comparison of years ended june  and net sales increased  or million  to million from million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
acquisitions made during the preceding twelve months contributed million of the increase in net sales  while same store sales increased million or decrease without propane 
valley sells propane to the residential  commercial and industrial markets 
typical residential and commercial uses include conventional space heating  water heating and cooking 
typical industrial uses include engine fuel for forklifts and other vehicles  metal cutting  brazing and heat treating 
the distribution of propane is seasonal in nature and sensitive to variations in weather with consumption as a heating fuel peaking sharply in winter months 
propane sales increased million  or  on a same store basis  reflecting million in price inflation and a million increase in the volume due to colder than normal temperatures during the past heating season and internal growth 
gases and cylinder rent represented of net sales for the year  with hard goods representing the remaining 
in comparison  net sales for the prior year reflected gases and cylinder rent of and hard goods of 
gross profit  which excludes depreciation and amortization  increased  or million  to million for the year  compared to million for the prior year 
acquisitions made during the preceding twelve months contributed million of the increase in gross profit 
same store gross profit decreased million  which included a million non recurring charge for disposal of slow moving hard goods inventory 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year  compared to for the prior year 
operating and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year  compared to million for the prior year 
of this increase  million was related to acquired businesses  with the balance of the change  or million  attributable to same store expenses 
the increase in same store operating expenses included million of non recurring charges relating to severance of personnel  termination of an airplane lease  conversion of company provided vehicles to employee owned vehicles and unclaimed property audits 
these charges resulted from valley s repositioning and upgrade initiatives that were undertaken late in fiscal year to reduce its on going cost structure  upgrade personnel and improve efficiency 
operating expenses also increased as a result of increased bad debt  settlement of sales and use tax audits with several states  increased liability insurance expense and an increase in estimated health insurance claims including claims incurred but not reported 
valley increased its accrual for estimated unpaid claims by million  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of this change 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million for the fiscal year  compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to non recurring charges of million relating to write off of non compete agreements held with former executives  which valley determined to no longer be of value  based upon a review of each individual s circumstances and the probability of effect on valley s performance and accelerated depreciation associated with leasehold improvements at facilities being closed by valley 
for each of the facilities being closed  valley determined the expected date for operations to cease and revised the estimated useful lives for applicable assets accordingly 
these initiatives were implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal year by valley in order to reduce its cost structure and to improve its operating efficiency 
interest expense increased  or million  to million for the year  compared to million for the prior year 
this increase reflected higher interest rates and fees associated with the amendment of valley s credit facility  and was partially offset by lower average debt balances 
valley s effective tax rate decreased from for the prior year to for the current year as a result primarily of changes in estimates for federal and state accrued taxes 
net income for the year was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  diluted earnings per share were for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year diluted weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources historically  valley has financed its operations  capital expenditures and debt service with funds provided from operating activities 
acquisitions have been financed by a combination of seller financing  bank borrowings and funds generated from operations 
at june   the company had working capital of approximately million  as compared to million as of june   reflecting primarily the reduction in inventory of million and the reduction of accounts receivable of funds provided by operations for the year ended june  were approximately million  as compared to million for the year ended june  this increase of million is primarily attributable to the million increase of net income  receipt of an income tax refund of million  the non recurrence of inventory write offs of million and reduction in inventory of million 
funds used for investing activities were approximately million for the year ended june   consisting primarily of capital spending  as compared to million for the year ended june  valley anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal year june  valley has committed million of the million for the purchase of distribution vehicles to be delivered in fiscal funds used for financing activities for the year ended june  were approximately million from net payments of debt  compared to million for the year ended june  the company s cash balance decreased million during the year ended june  to million 
at june   the company had working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of june   reflecting primarily the reduction in inventory levels 
funds provided by operations for the twelve months ended june  were approximately million  compared to million for fiscal year funds used for investing activities were approximately million for the twelve months ended june   consisting primarily of capital spending and acquisitions  compared to million in fiscal year funds used for financing activities for the twelve months ended june  were approximately million from net payments of debt  compared to million for the company s cash balance increased million during the twelve months to million 
on june   valley entered into a third amendment to its second amended and restated credit agreement changing the covenant requirements and the interest rate pricing grid 
the maximum revolving note borrowings under this agreement was million with a june  maturity date at june  on april   valley entered into an amended credit agreement establishing a million revolving note with a maturity of five years  replacing the previous revolving and term notes described above 
covenant requirements under the amended agreement are not significantly different from those under the previous agreement 
the weighted average interest rate for substantially all of the borrowings under the credit facility was as of june  as of june   availability under the revolving loan was approximately million  with outstanding borrowings of approximately million and outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
the credit facility is secured by all of valley s assets 
the revolving loan is used primarily to fund acquisitions 
valley is not required to make principal payments on outstanding balances of the revolving loan as long as certain covenants are satisfied 
interest is charged on the revolving loan at either the lender s prime rate or various libor rates  at valley s discretion  plus an applicable spread 
the loan agreement for the credit facility  as amended  contains various financial covenants applicable to valley  including covenants requiring minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum funded debt to ebitda 
as of june   valley is in compliance with these covenants and believes that it will continue to be in compliance through at least the next twelve months 
the variable interest entities debt  in the amount of million  consists primarily of asset backed mortgages for real estate 
this debt has various interest rates ranging from to and various maturities from to certain mortgages are personally guaranteed by the chairman of valley 
valley is obligated under various promissory notes related to the financing of acquisitions that have various rates of interest ranging from to per annum and maturities through the outstanding balance of these notes as of june  was million 
some of these notes are secured by assets related to the applicable acquisition  some are unsecured and some are backed by bank letters of credit issued under valley s credit facility 
valley enters into contractual agreements in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks 
counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions 
management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote and any losses would not be significant 
interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce interest rate risks and costs inherent in valley s debt portfolio 
valley enters into these agreements to change the variable fixed interest rate mix of the debt portfolio in order to maintain the percentage of fixed and variable debt within certain parameters set by management 
accordingly  valley enters into agreements to effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as of june   valley had million in notional amounts outstanding under interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps have an average pay rate of versus a receive rate of 
valley has previously entered into a put call option agreement with an independent distributor for the purchase of its business 
the put option became exercisable in may and ends in may the call option becomes exercisable upon expiration of the put option and ends in may the total purchase price of this acquisition is currently estimated to be million  which includes a non refundable payment of million previously paid for this option 
valley believes that it will have adequate capital resources available to fund this acquisition and be in compliance with its debt covenant requirements at such time that the option is exercised 
valley believes that cash generated from operations  borrowing availability under its credit facility and the ability to obtain financing with sellers of businesses will be sufficient to satisfy valley s requirements for operating funds  capital expenditures and future acquisitions for at least the next twelve months 
valley has no plans at this time to issue additional shares of common stock although it may consider issuing additional shares in the future as an acquisition currency if a large acquisition opportunity were to develop in the future

industry overview business strategy 
the schedule of maturities by segment of the company s debt for the next five years and thereafter is as follows variable fiscal year ending june  valley interest entities company thereafter    total    the following table represents the company s contractual obligations at june  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     capital lease obligation    operating leases     purchase obligations   purchase obligations represent the total value of all open purchase orders for the purchase of inventory as of june  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  determining the net carrying value of trade receivables  inventories  goodwill  other intangible assets and employee health care benefit reserves 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
trade receivables valley estimates the collectability of its trade receivables on a monthly basis 
management has established an allowance for doubtful accounts to adjust the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on an estimate of the amount of trade receivables that are deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical experience  economic trends and management s knowledge of significant accounts 
management believes that the allowances for doubtful accounts as of june  and are adequate 
inventories valley s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
valley writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimates of physical losses of inventory are made on a quarterly basis based upon historical results and comparison to industry averages 
goodwill and other intangible assets valley adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  as of july  sfas requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not to be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
valley has elected to perform its annual test for indications of goodwill impairment as of june th of each year 
since each valley location is an operating segment  management considers goodwill by location in evaluating impairment 
the annual impairment test used by valley includes a discounted cash flow analysis as well as other tests of the market value of its business entity 
the discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
examples include i projections on company operating performance  ii assumptions as to valley s cost of capital and iii assumptions as to the availability of capital in the future 
employee health care benefits payable valley has self funded health care benefit programs in place whereby a third party administrator settles and pays incurred claims on an on going basis 
valley estimates the level of outstanding claims  at any point in time  which amounted to million and million at june  and  respectively 
included in this estimate are claims incurred but not reported  based upon historical payment patterns  knowledge of individual claims and estimates of health care costs 
valley has stop loss insurance coverage in place to limit the extent of individual claims 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
estimates of the remaining useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually at the close of the fiscal year 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of discounted or undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the assets 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no   accounting for income taxes  under which deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the estimated tax rate at the date of reversal 
these differences are classified as current or non current based upon the classification of the related asset or liability 
for temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability  classification is based upon the expected reversal date of the temporary difference 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the company estimates and records additional tax expense based on uncertain tax positions taken by the company within statutory limitations 
this estimate is adjusted when tax audits are completed or when the statute of limitations expires on those recorded tax positions 
segments effective with the adoption of fin r in the third quarter of and the required consolidation of certain variable interest entities see note  the company has two reportable segments valley and variable interest entities 
since these are two separate and distinct businesses  the financial information for each company is maintained and managed separately 
the results of operations and assets for each of these segments are derived from separate financial reporting systems 
all intercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation 
the variable interest entities reportable segment  including west rentals  inc  gew real estate llc  real equip lease llc and acetylene products corporation primarily purchases  develops  sells and or leases real estate 
the valley reportable segment operates retail and distribution locations in states 
all locations offer the same core products of packaged gases  welding equipment and supplies 
all locations generally sell to the same types of customers such as metal fabrication  construction  general industrial  research and laboratory  hospital and other medical  commercial  agricultural and residential 
the company considers each of the locations to be an operating segment as defined in fasb  however  none of these locations individually meet the quantitative thresholds stated in fasb of of revenue or profits or assets 
in addition  these segments are so similar in economic characteristics  long term gross margin averages  products sold  types of customers  methods of distribution and regulatory environment that these operating segments should be aggregated into one reporting segment 
fluctuations in quarterly results valley generally has experienced higher sales activity during its second and third quarters as a result of seasonal sales of propane  with corresponding lower sales for the first and fourth quarters 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  valley s quarterly sales as a percentage of the respective fiscal year s sales 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends 
years ended june  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter as a result  income from operations and net income typically are higher for the second and third quarters than for the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
the timing of acquisitions may also have an appreciable effect on quarter to quarter earnings 
inflation the impact of inflation on valley s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally low rates of inflation in the economy and valley s historical ability to pass purchase price increases to its customers in the form of sales price increases 
while inflation has not had  and valley does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that valley s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued fin a variable interest entity  or vie  is one where the contractual or ownership interests in an entity change with changes in the entity s net asset value 
this interpretation requires the consolidation of a vie by the primary beneficiary  and also requires disclosure about vies where an enterprise has a significant variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary 
fin was effective as of the second quarter of fiscal year for vies existing prior to february  the required disclosure provisions of fin were adopted in fiscal year in december  the fasb issued fin r to further clarify the standard 
as required under the most recent deferral  valley adopted fin r as of march  valley analyzed fin r and its impact on the financial statements with regard to the put call agreement as well as related party lease agreements discussed in note to the financial statements 
valley concluded that the put call agreement meets the scope exception requirements of fin r for an entity deemed to be a business and therefore was not consolidated at march  in addition  valley concluded that the related party lease arrangement is a variable interest entity and  therefore  is required to be consolidated with valley s financial statements  as of march   pursuant to the common control provisions under fin r see note and to the financial statements
