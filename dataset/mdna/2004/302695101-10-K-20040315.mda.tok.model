item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction fences i settlement agreement 
as part of our future payments towards a million accrued liability at december   we agreed to pay to pogc a certain amount of cash  assign all of our rights to the kleka well to pogc  and offset against that liability million recorded as accounts receivable as of december   for kleka gas sales 
during  we paid a total of million in cash and recorded a  value added tax liability in partial settlement of the million liability to pogc 
when we complete the assignment of the kleka well  we believe we will have satisfied this liability in full 
as of december   we had estimated proved developed producing gas reserves  as determined by an independent engineer  with an estimated net present value  discounted at  of approximately million related to our interest in the kleka well 
we continue to discuss with pogc the amount we will be credited for assigning to it the kleka well 
should pogc not concur with the independent engineer s assessment of reserves  we may be required to pay additional cash to settle the remaining million liability to pogc 
in january  we entered into a farmout agreement with calenergy gas  the upstream gas business unit of midamerican energy holdings company  whereby calenergy gas had the right  but not the obligation  to earn a interest in the entire fences i project area by spending a total of million  including the cost to drill two wells and certain cash payments to us 
following completion of the zaniemysl well in early  calenergy gas requested more than a six month extension in which to undertake an additional technical evaluation before committing to an additional exploration well 
we and pogc elected instead to proceed without delay to select a specific drillsite in the rusocin prospect in fences i and to proceed with drilling as soon as possible 
accordingly  calenergy gas no longer has the right to participate in our right to earn a interest in the fences i project area  except for the approximately  acre zaniemysl field  in which we and calenergy gas each hold a interest 
for details of our agreement with calenergy gas holdings ltd  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction calenergy gas agreement 
the operating committee approved the zaniemysl prospect as the first well to be drilled under this farmout agreement and drilling commenced in october in february  we announced that the zaniemysl exploratory well in the fences i project area was commercial and encountered approximately net meters feet of porous gas bearing rotliegendes sandstone 
during a drill stem test of the top meters of the structure  the well flowed at a stabilized rate of approximately million cubic feet of gas per day 
together with our partners  pogc and calenergy gas  we are evaluating how to best produce and exploit the zaniemysl structure 
further analysis of the core  log and pressure data will be required before reserve numbers can be established 
a mile pipeline will be required to tie into the pogc grid near the radlin field 
we are currently planning to drill two additional exploratory wells in fences i in  including the first well in the rusocin prospect  which we hope will be the first well in a continuous drilling program in fences i  utilizing the same drilling rig 
we have no plans to seek a farmout with an industry participant 
fences ii project area in early  conoco  inc  ruhrgas and pogc drilled a dry hole in the northeast of the fences ii area 
the well  although dry  did confirm the presence of reservoir quality rotliegendes sandstone at a depth of more than  meters  which makes virtually the entire block prospective for rotliegendes  subject to accurate geophysical resolution of the trapping features 
a significant amount of geological and geophysical work was completed by pogc and conoco before conoco s withdrawal from the project at the end of and made available to us by pogc 
as a result  we were able to immediately identify drill ready prospects in the fences ii project area 
we are currently reprocessing approximately  kilometers of d seismic data  which will complement the  kilometers reprocessed in  to develop a complete subsurface picture of the rotliegendes and zechstein horizons  and are planning to drill at least two exploratory wells in this area in  including the initial test of the sroda prospect 
as with the rusocin prospect  we hope the sroda test will be the first well in a continuous drilling program in fences ii 
we have no plans to seek a farmout with an industry participant 
fences iii project area we have assembled the existing seismic data  which includes seismic in the northern of the fences iii project area 
we have evaluated the seismic data for reprocessing and plan to carry out a geophysical exploration program to identify leads and prospects that merit drilling 
at this time  we intend to carry out this work before deciding whether to drill on our own or seek a farmout with an industry participant 
the republic of poland the republic of poland is located in central europe  has a population of approximately million people  and covers an area comparable in size to new mexico 
during  poland peacefully asserted its independence and became a parliamentary democracy 
since  poland has enacted comprehensive economic reform programs and stabilization measures that have enabled it to form a free market economy and turn its economic ties from the east to the west  with most of its current international trade with the countries of the european union and the united states 
the economy has undergone extensive restructuring in the post communist era 
the polish government credits foreign investment as a forceful growth factor in successfully creating a stable free market economy 
according to the polish foreign investment agency  cumulative foreign direct investment flow into poland is estimated to have aggregated approximately billion from through mid since its transition to a market economy and a parliamentary democracy  poland has experienced significant economic growth and political change 
poland has developed and is refining legal  tax and regulatory systems characteristic of parliamentary democracies with interpretation and procedural safeguards 
the polish government has generally taken steps to harmonize polish legislation with that of the european union in anticipation of poland s entry into the european union in may and to facilitate interaction with european union members 
since  the polish corporate income tax rate has been gradually reduced and is at of taxable income as of january  poland has created an attractive legal framework and fiscal regime for oil and gas exploration by actively encouraging investment by foreign companies to offset its lack of capital to further explore its oil and gas resources 
in july  poland s council of ministers approved a program to restructure and privatize the polish petroleum sector 
so far under this plan  a refinery located in plock has been privatized as a publicly held company with its stock trading on the london and warsaw stock exchanges 
we expect that the gas distribution segments of pogc will be privatized next  followed by the exploration  production and oilfield services segment 
increased participation by western companies using western capital in the oil and gas sector is consistent with the approved privatization policy 
prior to becoming a parliamentary democracy during  the exploration and development of poland s oil and gas resources were hindered by a combination of foreign influence  a centrally controlled economy  limited financial resources  and a lack of modern exploration technology 
as a result  poland is currently a net energy importer 
oil is imported primarily from countries of the former soviet union and the middle east  and gas is imported primarily from russia 
in the early s  the world bank loaned poland million to fund the purchase of new exploration and drilling equipment for poland s oil and gas industry to help shift its domestic sources of energy consumed from coal to oil and natural gas 
poland has also improved its technical and data gathering capabilities 
poland joined nato in and will join the european union in may in order to achieve member status in the european union  poland must raise its environmental standards 
in poland  coal is the dominant energy source 
increased consumption of natural gas  as an alternative to coal  is considered to be a key component in meeting the european union s strict environmental guidelines for its members 
the demand for gas in poland is expected by some to increase in the future  primarily due to increased economic growth coupled with the conversion to gas from coal as an energy source for power plants 
however  to date  the demand for natural gas has remained flat and is predicted by others to remain so over the next decade  due in large part to the fact that natural gas is uneconomical for power generation in poland compared to coal  which is widely and cheaply produced 
poland has crude oil pipelines serving the major refineries and a network of gas pipelines serving major metropolitan  commercial  industrial and gas production areas  including significant portions of our acreage 
poland has a well developed infrastructure of hard surfaced roads and railways over which we believe oil produced could be transported for sale 
there are refineries in gdansk and plock in poland and one in germany near the western polish border that we believe could process any crude oil we may produce in poland 
all facilities and pipelines currently used to gather and transport oil and gas in poland are owned and operated by pogc 
polish properties legal framework general usufruct and concession terms in  poland adopted the geological and mining law  which specifies the process for obtaining domestic exploration and exploitation rights 
all of our rights in poland have been awarded pursuant to this law 
under the geological and mining law  the concession authority enters into oil  gas and mining usufruct lease agreements that grant the holder the exclusive right to explore or exploit the designated oil and gas or minerals for a specified period under prescribed terms and conditions 
the holder of the mining usufruct must also acquire an exploration concession to obtain surface access to the exploration area by applying to the concession authority and providing the opportunity for comment by local governmental authorities 
the concession authority has granted us oil and gas exploration rights on the fences iii  wilga  and pomeranian project areas  and has granted pogc oil and gas exploration rights on the fences i and ii project areas 
the agreements divide these areas into blocks  generally containing approximately  acres each 
concession licenses have been acquired for surface access to all areas that lie within existing usufructs 
the exploration period begins after the date of the last concession signed under each respective usufruct 
we believe all material concession terms have been satisfied to date 
if commercially viable oil or gas is discovered  the concession owner then applies for an exploitation concession  as provided by the usufructs  generally with a term of to years or as long as commercial production continues 
upon the grant of the exploitation concession  the concession owner may become obligated to pay a fee  to be negotiated  but expected to be less than of the market value of the estimated recoverable reserves in place 
the concession owner would also be required to pay a royalty on any production  the amount of which will be set by the council of ministers  within a range established by legislation for the mineral being extracted 
the royalty rate for gas is currently less than per mcf 
this rate could be increased or decreased by the council of ministers to a rate between and per mcf the current statutory minimum and maximum royalty rate 
local governments will receive of any royalties paid on production 
the holder of the exploitation concession license must also acquire rights to use the land from the surface owner 
the usufruct owner could be subject to significant delays in obtaining the consents of local authorities or satisfying other governmental requirements prior to obtaining an exploitation concession 
fences i project area the fences i project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession controlled by pogc 
three producing fields radlin  kleka and kaleje lie within the concession boundary  but are excluded from the fences i concession 
the concession is for a period of six years ending in september and carries a work requirement during the first three years of one exploratory well  square kilometers of d seismic data  and reprocessing of kilometers of d seismic data 
the drilling and seismic reprocessing requirements have been completed 
fences ii project area the fences ii project area consists of four oil and gas exploration concessions controlled by pogc 
the concessions have expiration dates ranging from july to august  with three year extension rights 
remaining work commitments in the aggregate include kilometers of d seismic  kilometers of new d seismic  kilometers of seismic reprocessing and drilling four wells 
fences iii project area the fences iii project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession held by us 
several producing fields lie within the concession boundaries  but are excluded from the fences iii project area 
the concession is for a period of six years ending in december and carries a work requirement during the first two years  which includes the reprocessing of kilometers of existing d seismic  kilometers of new d seismic  and analysis and interpretation of existing well data 
beginning in the third year  there is a drilling requirement of one well 
wilga block project area the wilga project area consists of a single oil and gas exploration concession controlled by apache 
all work commitments have been completed 
no further exploration is planned for the block at this time  and we may farm out or sell our interest 
pomeranian project area the pomeranian project area consists of oil and gas concessions controlled by us 
the concessions are for a period of six years ending in december  when the concession must be relinquished except for lands within exploitation concessions or for which an application for an exploitation concession has been filed 
we have decided to drop this acreage to focus on the much lower risk rotliegendes and zechstein plays in the fences area 
as of december   all required usufruct concession payments had been made for each of the above project areas 
production  transportation and marketing poland has a network of gas pipelines and crude oil pipelines traversing the country serving major metropolitan  commercial  industrial and gas production areas  including significant portions of our acreage 
poland has a well developed infrastructure of hard surfaced roads and railways over which we believe oil produced could be transported for sale 
there are refineries in gdansk and plock in poland and one in germany near the western polish border that we believe could process crude oil produced in poland 
should we choose to export any oil or gas we produce  we will be required to obtain prior governmental approval 
during early  we and pogc constructed a pipeline from the kleka well approximately four kilometers to pogc s radlin field gas processing facility and began selling gas produced to pogc at a price of per mmbtu under a five year contract that may be terminated by us with a day written notice 
as part of our restructured agreement with pogc  we agreed to assign our interest in the kleka well  including amounts representing unpaid gas sales  to pogc to reduce the outstanding obligation to pogc 
accordingly  we received no net gas production from the kleka well in  our only producing well in poland 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we did not have any oil or gas production in poland during the following table sets forth our average net daily gas production  average sales price and average production costs associated with our polish gas production during and polish producing property data average daily net gas production mcf average sales price per mmbtu average production costs per mcf consists solely of the kleka well  which began producing on february   and which we agreed to transfer to pogc effective december production was reduced during to control the production of water

production in the cut bank field commenced with the discovery of oil in the s at an average depth of approximately  feet 
the southwest cut bank sand unit  which is the core of our interest in the field  was originally formed by phillips petroleum company in an initial pilot waterflood program was started in by phillips and eventually encompassed the entire unit with producing wells on and acre spacing 
in the cut bank field  we own an average working interest of in producing oil wells  active injection wells and one active water supply well

we sell oil at posted field prices to one of several purchasers in each of our production areas 
from june through july  we sold our montana production  which represents over of our total oil sales  to plains marketing canada lp in august  we began selling the majority of our production to cenex  a regional refiner and marketer 
for the first half of and for the entire year ended december   the bulk of our total oil sales were also to cenex 
posted prices are generally competitive among crude oil purchasers 
our crude oil sales contracts may be terminated by either party upon days notice 
oilfield services drilling rig and well servicing equipment in montana  we perform  through our drilling subsidiary  fx drilling company  inc  a variety of third party contract oilfield services  including drilling  workovers  location work  cementing and acidizing 
we currently have a drilling rig capable of drilling to a vertical depth of  feet  a workover rig  two service rigs  cementing equipment  acidizing equipment and other associated oilfield servicing equipment 
we first started our oilfield servicing business in in an effort to increase our united states revenues  which had been declining due to the depressed oil prices that had occurred throughout that year 
proved reserves proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions 
our proved oil and gas reserve quantities and values are based on estimates prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
operating costs  production taxes and development costs were deducted in determining the quantity and value information 
such costs were estimated based on current costs and were not adjusted to anticipate increases due to inflation or other factors 
no price escalations were assumed and no amounts were deducted for general overhead  depreciation  depletion and amortization  interest expense and income taxes 
the proved reserve quantity and value information is based on the weighted average price on december   of per bbl for oil in the united states and per mcf of gas in poland 
the determination of oil and gas reserves is based on estimates and is highly complex and interpretive  as there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves  projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the estimated present value  discounted at per annum  of the future net cash flows  or pv value  was determined in accordance with sfas no 
disclosure about oil and gas activities and sec guidelines 
our proved reserve estimates are subject to continuing revisions as additional information becomes available or assumptions change 
estimates of our proved united states oil reserves were prepared by larry krause consulting  an independent engineering firm in billings  montana 
estimates of our proved polish gas reserves were prepared by troy ikoda limited  an independent engineering firm in the united kingdom 
no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in any report to any other federal agency during the following summary of proved reserve information as of december   represents estimates net to us only and should not be construed as exact united states poland total oil pv value gas pv value pv value mbbls in thousands mmcf in thousands in thousands proved reserves developed producing     undeveloped    total     our proved developed producing gas reserves in poland relate solely to the kleka well in the fences i project area  which we agreed effective december to transfer to pogc for a credit against our obligation to it 
we continue to discuss with pogc the amount we will be credited for assigning to it the kleka well 
should pogc not concur with the independent engineer s assessment of reserves summarized above  we may be required to pay additional cash to settle our remaining million liability to pogc

the net acreage amount assumes we spend million of exploration expenditures to earn a interest 
excludes acreage in which we may earn an interest under arrangements reached after december  we own a interest in the pomeranian project area  except for block approximately  acres  where we own an interest 
we have made the decision to drop all of the pomeranian acreage 
in addition to the acreage shown in the above table  we have the right  subject to the satisfactory completion of our earning obligations  to earn acreage in the fences i  ii  and iii project areas as shown in the table found under exploration  development and production activities in poland polish exploration rights 
government regulation poland our activities in poland are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties  including the adoption of new laws  regulations or administrative policies that may adversely affect us or the terms of our exploration or production rights  political instability and changes in government or public or administrative policies  export and transportation tariffs and local and national taxes  foreign exchange and currency restrictions and fluctuations  repatriation limitations  inflation  environmental regulations and other matters 
these operations in poland are subject to the geological and mining law dated as of september   and the protection and management of the environment act dated as of january   which are the current primary statutes governing environmental protection 
agreements with the government of poland respecting our areas create certain standards to be met regarding environmental protection 
participants in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities generally are required to adhere to good international petroleum industry practices  including practices relating to the protection of the environment  and prepare and submit geological work plans  with specific attention to environmental matters  to the appropriate agency of state geological administration for its approval prior to engaging in field operations such as seismic data acquisition  exploratory drilling and field wide development 
poland s regulatory framework respecting environmental protection is not as fully developed and detailed as that which exists in the united states 
we intend to conduct our operations in poland in accordance with good international petroleum industry practices and  as they develop  polish requirements 
as poland continues to progress towards its stated goal of becoming a member of the european union  it is expected to pass further legislation aimed at harmonizing polish environmental law with that of the european union 
the european union treaty of accession will require divestment by the polish government of certain portions of the oil and gas business 
changes in the industry ownership may affect the business climate where we operate 
united states state and local regulation of drilling and production our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
our oil production is affected to some degree by state regulations 
states in which we operate have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and gas  including provisions regarding deliverability 
such statutes and related regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and gas between owners of a common reservoir 
certain state regulatory authorities also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit 
environmental regulations the federal government and various state and local governments have adopted laws and regulations regarding the control of contamination of the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit by operators before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
these laws and regulations may also increase the costs of drilling and operation of wells 
we may also be held liable for the costs of removal and damages arising out of a pollution incident to the extent set forth in the federal water pollution control act  as amended by the oil pollution act of  or opa in addition  we may be subject to other civil claims arising out of any such incident 
as with any owner of property  we are also subject to clean up costs and liability for hazardous materials  asbestos or any other toxic or hazardous substance that may exist on or under any of our properties 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws  rules and regulations and that continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
furthermore  we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than our competitors in the oil and gas industry 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances 
under cercla  such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
furthermore  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra  however  excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development  or production of crude oil  gas or geothermal energy 
because of this exclusion  many of our operations are exempt from rcra regulation 
nevertheless  we must comply with rcra regulations for any of our operations that do not fall within the rcra exclusion 
the opa and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
opa establishes strict liability for owners of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the united states 
while opa liability more typically applies to facilities near substantial bodies of water  at least one district court has held that opa liability can attach if the contamination could enter waters that may flow into navigable waters 
stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future  such as proposals made in congress and at the state level from time to time  that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
the impact of any such changes  however  would not likely be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated company involved in oil and gas exploration and production 
federal and indian leases a substantial part of our producing properties in montana consist of oil and gas leases issued by the bureau of land management or by the blackfeet tribe under the supervision of the bureau of indian affairs 
these activities must comply with rules and orders that regulate aspects of the oil and gas industry  including drilling and operating on leased land and the calculation and payment of royalties to the federal government or the governing indian nation 
operations on indian lands must also comply with applicable requirements of the governing body of the tribe involved including  in some instances  the employment of tribal members 
we believe we are currently in full compliance with all material provisions of such regulations 
safety and health regulations we must also conduct our operations in accordance with various laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health 
currently  we do not foresee expending material amounts to comply with these occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
however  since such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are unable to predict the future effect of these laws and regulations 
title to properties we rely on sovereign ownership of exploration rights and mineral interests by the polish government in connection with our activities in poland and have not conducted and do not plan to conduct any independent title examination 
we regularly consult with our polish legal counsel when doing business in poland 
nearly all of our united states working interests are held under leases from third parties 
we typically obtain a title opinion concerning such properties prior to the commencement of drilling operations 
we have obtained such title opinions or other third party review on nearly all of our producing properties  and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all such properties sufficient to meet standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
our united states properties are subject to typical burdens  including customary royalty interests and liens for current taxes  but we have concluded that such burdens do not materially interfere with the use of such properties 
further  we believe the economic effects of such burdens have been appropriately reflected in our acquisition cost of such properties and reserve estimates 
title investigation before the acquisition of undeveloped properties is less thorough than that conducted prior to drilling  as is standard practice in the industry 
employees and consultants as of december   we had employees  consisting of eight in salt lake city  utah  seventeen in oilmont  montana  one in greenwich  connecticut  and two in houston  texas 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 
we also regularly engage technical consultants to provide specific geological  geophysical and other professional services 
we have no employees residing in poland but rely on others to conduct field operations or provide services under consulting or other contracts 
our executive officers and other management employees regularly travel to poland to supervise activities conducted by others under contract on our behalf 
offices and facilities our corporate offices  located at highland drive  salt lake city  utah  contain approximately  square feet and are rented at  per month under a month to month agreement 
in montana  we own a  square foot building located at the corner of central and main in oilmont  where we utilize  square feet for our field office and rent the remaining space to unrelated third parties for per month 
in poland  we rent a small office suite for  per month in warsaw  at al 
jerozolimskie  as an office of record in poland

recent sales of unregistered securities in november  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  units  each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a five year warrant to purchase one share of common stock at per share  an aggregate of  additional shares 
these units were sold in a private placement of securities to five unaffiliated purchasers pursuant to antidilution provisions of our march private placement of series convertible preferred stock and to one officer 
in december  we sold  shares of common stock in a private placement of securities to unaffiliated purchasers  raising a total of million net of offering costs of 
the offering was placed privately  primarily through cdc securities  inc  and included unaffiliated purchasers pursuant to antidilutive provisions of our march private placement of series convertible preferred stock 
net proceeds from these placements will be used to pay geological and geophysical costs  general and administrative and project marketing costs  and our share of further exploration and possible production facilities 
each of the purchasers in each transaction was an accredited investor who was provided with a private placement memorandum detailing our business and financial information  including copies of our periodic reports as filed with the securities and exchange commission  and who was provided with the opportunity to ask questions directly of our executive officers 
in each of the above transactions  the securities purchased were restricted securities taken for investment 
certificates for all shares issued in the such transactions bore a restrictive legend conspicuously on their face and stop transfer instructions were noted respecting such certificates on our stock transfer records 
each of the foregoing transactions was effected in reliance on the exemption from registration provided in section of the securities act of as transactions not involving any public offering

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
introduction was an important year for fx energy 
at the beginning of the year  we were in a tenuous financial situation  with negative working capital of million and  in cash 
there was doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
during the year  we made considerable progress in improving our financial condition 
through private placements of common and preferred stock  we raised million net of offering costs 
in addition  we converted million of outstanding debt and accrued interest payable into common stock 
we also used proceeds from our equity offerings to make payments on our outstanding obligations to pogc 
at the end of the year  we had cash of approximately million  with working capital of million 
we were also successful in in launching our exploration program in the fences i and ii prospect areas 
we entered into a farmout agreement with calenergy gas  and in october with pogc and calenergy gas began drilling the zaniemysl well in the fences i area 
we announced early in that the well encountered approximately net meters feet of porous gas bearing rotliegendes sandstone 
during a drill stem test of the top meters of the structure  the well flowed at a controlled rate of approximately million cubic feet of gas per day 
together with our partners  pogc and calenergy gas  we are evaluating how to best produce and exploit the zaniemysl field 
for further discussion concerning the zaniemysl well and the fences i and ii areas  see exploration  development and production activities in poland 
in early  we also announced the creation of our technical and advisory panel  consisting of three individuals with extensive experience in international oil and gas exploration and investment banking  including extensive experience and success in the southern north sea 
we believe that the addition of these individuals to our technical team greatly enhanced our exploration expertise and our ability to attract capital 
we believe that we are now well positioned to carry out our exploration plans in poland 
we believe that we have enough capital to drill at least four additional wells in the fences i and ii areas during  without selling or farming out any of our working interests  in addition to funding increased levels of geological and geophysical costs and ongoing administrative expenses 
following is a brief discussion concerning some the significant events that occurred during private placements of common and convertible preferred stock in march  we sold  shares of series convertible preferred stock in a private placement of securities  raising a total of  after offering costs of  each share of preferred stock immediately converted into one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at per share upon registration of the common shares 
the warrants to purchase common stock are exercisable anytime between march   and march   and entitle the holders  for a period of days following any new issuances of equity securities or securities convertible or exercisable into equity securities in other than a public offering  to preserve their approximate ownership subsequent to this offering by purchasing such new securities issued on the same terms as issued to others 
the preferred stock had a liquidation preference equal to the sales price for the shares  which was per share 
the  shares of series convertible preferred stock were converted to our common stock on a one for one basis on october   pursuant to a registration statement that became effective on that date 
between the months of july and november   we sold  units  consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at per share  raising a total of  after offering costs of  the warrants to purchase common stock are exercisable one year after closing and expire between july   and november  in december  we placed privately  shares of common stock  raising a total of  after offering costs of  approximately million of the net proceeds came from several european investors including banks  mutual funds  life insurance companies and pension funds located in germany  austria  belgium and spain 
this is the first significant investment in the company by investors in the european financial community  and we are hopeful that this placement will create additional interest from other european investors 
the net proceeds from the offerings were used to reduce the note payable to rolls royce power ventures limited  or rrpv  to reduce the accrued liability to the polish oil and gas company  and will be used to fund ongoing geological  geophysical and drilling costs in poland  and support ongoing prospect marketing and general and administrative costs 
rolls royce power ventures in march  following the private placement of convertible preferred stock  we paid million to rrpv  which included million in principal   in accrued interest  and a  loan extension fee 
in return  rrpv amended the loan agreement to extend the maturity date of the note to december  we agreed to pay of the gross proceeds of any subsequent equity or debt offering concluded prior to the amended maturity date  up to the amount still owing under the loan agreement to rrpv  and also agreed to assign our rights to payments under the calenergy gas agreement to rrpv  except for those amounts relating to two wells required to be drilled under the agreement 
all such payments would be used to offset the remaining principal and interest 
the loan amendment contained other terms and conditions  including an increase in the interest rate on the note from to per annum effective march   an extension of the conversion period until december   with the conversion price being changed from per share to per share  the market price of our stock when rrpv agreed to extend the payment date  and an extension fee payment of  in september  we placed the then outstanding million principal balance of the note into an escrow account in favor of rrpv 
in turn  the interest rate on the loan was reduced to per annum 
in december  rrpv exercised its right to convert the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest into  shares of common stock 
rrpv released to us the escrowed funds and subsequently released all outstanding liens and other collateral secured by the note to us 
consequently  we have fully satisfied and discharged all of our obligations to rrpv 
calenergy gas agreement in january  we signed a farmout agreement with calenergy gas holdings ltd  an affiliate of midamerican energy holdings company  for the joint exploration of our fences i project in poland 
under the terms of the agreement  calenergy gas had the right  but not the obligation  to pay of the costs to drill an initial well  and by so doing  earn a interest of our interest in that drilling prospect 
following the completion of the initial well  calenergy gas could elect to terminate the agreement or to drill a second well 
if calenergy gas elected to drill a second well  it would be obligated to pay us million prior to drilling 
calenergy gas would also have been obligated to pay of the costs of drilling a second well to earn interest in that prospect 
following the second well  calenergy gas had the option to acquire of our interest of the entire fences project area by paying to us the sum of million  less the costs of drilling the first two wells and less the cost of any additional geological and geophysical costs it incurred on the fences area 
following completion of the zaniemysl well in early  calenergy gas requested more than a six month extension in which to undertake an additional technical evaluation before committing to an additional exploration well 
we and pogc elected instead to proceed without delay to select a specific drillsite in the rusocin prospect in fences i and to proceed with drilling as soon as possible 
by virtue of the zaniemysl well  calenergy gas retains a working interest in the approximately  gross acre zaniemysl field  but calenergy gas will have no right to participate in other prospects in the fences i area 
we will continue to work with calenergy gas and pogc on development of the zaniemysl discovery and surrounding opportunities that can be developed as part of a single economic unit 
all of the qualifying costs related to our interest in the fences i project area that are paid for by calenergy gas will be credited against the remaining obligation under our million earn in agreement with pogc see below 
we believe that our outstanding obligation will be reduced by approximately million related to the costs of the zanymiesl well 
calenergy gas has received consent from pogc to the transfer of one half of our working interest according to the agreement terms 
fences i settlement agreement on april   we agreed to spend million of exploration costs on the fences i project area to earn a interest 
when expenditures exceed million  pogc will be obligated to pay its share of further costs 
through the end of  we had paid million towards the million and had accrued approximately million of additional costs pertaining to the fences i project area 
in late  as part of our discussions with pogc concerning the calenergy gas agreement and the opportunity to participate with pogc in other exploration projects  we reaffirmed our intent to fulfill the million commitment with pogc and entered into an agreement to restructure our payments to them 
in connection with this agreement  and in order to clarify uncertainties about the nature and timing of our obligation regarding the balance of our million commitment  we agreed to recognize in  and pay to pogc at a future date  an additional million of costs related to prior exploration activities in the fences project areas  million of which will be credited towards the million commitment 
the amount includes  in interest costs related to our prior liabilities to pogc   in drilling costs   in pipeline costs   in seismic costs  and  related to foreign exchange adjustments 
as part of our agreement  we agreed that the remaining balance under our million commitment was million as of january since that time  we have incurred additional qualifying costs of approximately  reducing our outstanding commitment to approximately million as of december  we expect that our outstanding commitment will be further reduced by approximately million in costs paid by calenergy gas associated with the zaniemysl well 
following the drilling of the initial test well on the rusocin prospect  and the acquisition and reprocessing of additional seismic in the fences i area scheduled for this year  we believe that we will have satisfied the entire million commitment by the end of as part of our future payments towards the million commitment  we agreed to assign to pogc all of our rights to the kleka well  including the amounts recorded as accounts receivable for kleka gas sales 
accordingly  at december   our receivable from pogc in the amount of  was offset against the pogc liability 
the liability is to be further offset by the value of the remaining gas reserves associated with the kleka well  as determined by an independent engineer 
we also agreed to begin accruing interest on the past due amount to pogc 
the interest rate in effect at december   was per annum  the interest rate was reduced in march to  and again to in september during  we paid a total of million in cash to pogc and recorded a  value added tax liability related to the kleka gas sales in partial settlement of the outstanding liability 
when we complete the assignment of the kleka well  we believe we will have satisfied this obligation in full 
as of december   our share of the kleka well had estimated proved developed producing gas reserves with an estimated net present value  discounted at  of approximately million  as determined by an independent engineer  an amount equal to our outstanding liability to pogc 
should pogc not concur with the independent engineer s assessment of reserves  we may be required to pay additional cash to settle our remaining million liability to pogc 
critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are considered not to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
intangible leasehold costs statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas were issued by the fasb in june and became effective for us on july   and january   respectively 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method 
additionally  sfas requires companies to disaggregate and report separately from goodwill certain intangible assets 
sfas establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized  but rather are reviewed annually for impairment 
one interpretation being considered relative to these standards is that oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds should be classified separately from oil and gas properties  as intangible assets on our balance sheets 
in addition  the disclosures required by sfas and relative to intangibles would be included in the notes to financial statements 
historically  we have included these oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves as part of the oil and gas properties  even after sfas and became effective 
this interpretation of sfas and described above would only affect our balance sheet classification of oil and gas leaseholds 
our results of operations and cash flows would not be affected  since these oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves would continue to be amortized in accordance with accounting rules for oil and gas companies provided in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
at both december  and  we had undeveloped leaseholds of approximately  and  respectively  that would be classified under that interpretation on our consolidated balance sheets as intangible undeveloped leaseholds and developed leaseholds of approximately  in both years that would be classified under that interpretation as intangible developed leaseholds if we applied the interpretation currently being considered 
we will continue to classify our oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual rights representing the right to extract such reserves as tangible oil and gas properties until further interpretative guidance is provided 
oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of our oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
proved reserve estimates are updated at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
this change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation rates 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense and impairment expense and in disclosing the supplemental standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas properties 
depreciation rates are determined based on estimated proved reserve quantities the denominator and capitalized costs of producing properties the numerator 
producing properties capitalized costs are amortized based on the units of oil or gas produced 
therefore  assuming all other variables are held constant  an increase in estimated proved reserves decreases our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
also  estimated reserves are often used to calculate future cash flows from our oil and gas operations  which serve as an indicator of fair value in determining whether a property is impaired or not 
the larger the estimated reserves  the less likely the property is impaired 
stock based compensation we have chosen to account for stock options granted to employees and directors under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
instead of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no

results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production segment  or e p  and the oilfield services segment 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
dd a  g a  amortization of deferred compensation g a  interest income  other income  interest expense  impairment of notes receivable from officers and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
a comparison of the results of operations by business segment and the information regarding nonsegmented items for the years ended december   and  respectively  follows 
further information concerning our business segments can be found in note  business segments  in the financial statements 
exploration and production segment a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil and gas revenues  average oil and gas prices  oil and gas production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel and mcf for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  oil gas oil gas oil gas revenues      percent change versus prior year average price bbls or mcf percent change versus prior year production volumes bbls or mcf      percent change versus prior year lifting costs per bbls or mcf percent change versus prior year the contract price for gas during and was per mmbtu  the produced gas averaged mmbtu per mcf 
lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced 
lifting costs per mcf of gas are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total mcf of gas produced before royalties 
lifting costs do not include production taxes 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
during these three years  oil revenues fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices and the declining production rates attributable to the natural production declines of our producing properties 
oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
oil revenues in increased from levels by approximately  due to higher oil prices  offset by approximately  related to production declines 
gas revenues 
our gas revenues are derived solely from our polish producing operations 
gas revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no gas revenues during as part of our fences i settlement with pogc in early  we agreed to assign our interest in the kleka well effective december  along with the related accounts receivable  to pogc as soon as possible in order to conserve cash while reducing the balance of our liability due to pogc 
accordingly  we recorded no gas sales in gas volumes in reflected a full year of production from the kleka  our first producing well in poland  which began producing in late february during and  gas produced by the kleka was sold to pogc based on us dollar pricing at a fixed price under a five year contract  which may be terminated by giving pogc a day written notice 
the decline in gas production from to is the result of the operator choking back the well to avoid any increase in water production 
lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million in and million for each of and operating costs rose slightly from to  and from to  as higher oil lifting costs offset lower oil and gas production 
operating costs in increased approximately  due to higher lifting costs  offset by approximately  related to lower oil and gas production 
operating costs in increased approximately  due to higher lifting costs  offset by approximately  related to lower oil and gas production 
exploration costs 
our exploration efforts are focused in poland  and the expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  exploratory dry holes and oil and gas leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
limited available capital caused us to sharply curtail our exploration activities in poland in and we expect to increase our level of exploration costs in as we increase our pace of prospect development  selection  and drilling 
g g costs were  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during and  most of our g g costs were spent on reprocessing and further analyzing the seismic data on the fences i area 
during  we spent approximately million on acquiring d seismic data in the fences project areas  and the remainder acquiring and analyzing d seismic data on the pomeranian project area 
exploratory dry hole costs were  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
due to our capital limitations  we did not participate in any exploratory drilling in and during  we incurred dry hole costs of million pertaining to the mieszkow well on the fences i project area 
impairments of oil and gas properties were  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the entire impairment related to the kleka well  which was written down to the value established by an independent reservoir engineer  and included both capital costs and related pipeline costs 
we have agreed to transfer the kleka well to pogc to satisfy outstanding obligations 
during  we incurred an impairment of  in costs associated with the tuchola well 
the well was completed in  but has since been shut in pending a pipeline connection 
constrained capital has prevented us from drilling the additional appraisal and development wells and building the necessary infrastructure 
we also recognized an impairment of million associated with the kleka well  where lower production profiles caused a downward revision in recoverable future reserves 
during  we incurred impairments of  for the baltic project area and  for the warsaw west project area  both of which are located in poland in areas where we no longer have exploration plans 
apache poland g a costs 
apache poland g a costs consist of our share of direct overhead costs incurred by apache in poland in accordance with the terms of the apache exploration program 
apache poland g a costs were  and  for the years ended december   and during mid  we began to narrow the focus of our ongoing exploratory efforts with apache by continuing to work only on the pomeranian and wilga project areas and discontinued our exploratory activities on the lublin basin  warsaw west and carpathian project areas 
there were no jointly conducted activities in the wilga project area in and dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
dd a expense during  and includes approximately   and  respectively  or per mcf of gas produced  associated solely with the kleka well that began producing in poland during february dd a expense declined from to due to reduced production from the well 
there was no dd a expense associated with poland during  as we agreed to transfer our interest in the kleka well to pogc 
the increase from to is due primarily to the net book value of domestic assets being increased as a result of the adoption of sfas effective january  oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the contract drilling industry was at a virtual standstill in the area where we operate  and the outlook for remains unfavorable 
the industry was also significantly curtailed in the area where we operate in  and our revenues declined sharply from as a result 
oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties  and other factors 
oilfield services costs 
oilfield services costs were   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
during and  oilfield servicing costs were a higher percentage of oilfield services revenues  as compared to  due to increased downtime  maintenance and repair costs associated with our oilfield servicing equipment 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties  and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
nonsegmented items g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  in recognition of our limited resources  we aggressively pursued certain cost reduction measures to help conserve capital 
as part of those reductions  most of our employees and directors and some of our consultants reduced their salaries and fees by 
during  after we successfully raised more than million through the sale of equity  we reinstated those salaries and fees 
in addition  we incurred higher accounting and legal fees as a result of an sec review of our and filings and the submission of several sec registration statements resulting from our stock sales 
accordingly  our g a costs were significantly higher than those incurred during in addition  we were able to resume many of our activities in poland  which resulted in higher travel costs for the year 
during  g a costs were unusually low  primarily due to the company writing off million of compensation that was accrued as of december  none of this waived compensation has or will be paid 
interest and other income corporate 
interest and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
lower cash balances and interest rates in and reduced our interest income in both years 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded other income of  and  respectively  pertaining to the amortization of an option premium resulting from granting rrpv an option to purchase gas from our properties in poland 
interest expense 
interest expense was  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in march  we began to accrue interest on the million rrpv obligation at an annual rate of 
from may to september   the rrpv interest rate increased to 
it was reduced to from october to november   at which time rrpv converted its note payable and accrued interest into common stock 
we began accruing interest our on obligation to pogc during  which accounted for interest expense of  and  in and  respectively 
as part of our further restructured agreement with pogc  we stopped accruing interest on the obligation at december  during and  we recorded  and  respectively  of imputed interest expense relating to our financing arrangement with rrpv 
amortization of deferred compensation g a 
amortization of deferred compensation was   and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
on april   we extended the term of options to purchase  shares of our common stock that were to expire during for a period of two years  with a one year vesting period 
on august   we extended the term of options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock that were to expire during for a period of two years  with a one year vesting period 
in accordance with fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  we incurred noncash deferred compensation costs of million  including  for the april   option extension and million for the august   option extension  to be amortized over their respective one year vesting periods from the date of extension 
the deferred costs were all amortized as of december  income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
liquidity and capital resources we have made significant progress in improving our liquidity and capital resources during the past year 
at the beginning of the year  we were in a tenuous financial situation  with negative working capital of million and  in cash 
through private placements of common and preferred stock  we raised million net of offering costs during in addition  million of outstanding debt and accrued interest were converted into common stock 
we used proceeds from our equity sales to reduce our outstanding obligations to pogc 
at the end of the year  we had cash of approximately million  with working capital of million 
we believe we are now well positioned to carry out our exploration activities in poland 
to date  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities  and agreements with industry participants that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in return for an interest in our properties 
the continuation of our exploratory efforts in poland may be dependent on our ability to raise additional capital or to farm out our properties 
the availability of such capital or farmouts may affect the timing  pace  scope and amount of our future capital expenditures 
we cannot assure that we will be able to secure additional participants or obtain additional equity or debt financing or complete farmout or other industry cost and risk sharing arrangements  particularly  if we fail to make additional discoveries 
such events would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we may seek to obtain additional funds for future capital investments from strategic alliances with other energy or financial participants  the sale of additional securities  project financing  sale of partial property interests  or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   an increase of million from december  the improvement is due primarily to the sale of equity securities discussed earlier 
in addition  million of outstanding debt and accrued interest were converted into common stock  which paid in full our note payable to rrpv 
our current liabilities include million of costs related to our fences i project in poland 
this amount is equal to the value of the remaining gas reserves at the kleka  which we have agreed to assign to pogc effective december we may be required to pay additional cash to settle this liability 
operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million and million in our operating activities during  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses incurred in those years 
we made significant progress in reducing our outstanding liabilities during investing activities 
we used net cash of million in investing activities in  used  in investing activities during  and received net cash of  from our investing activities during during  we used  to pay liabilities associated with oil and gas property additions from prior years 
also included in this amount is a deposit with calenergy gas in the amount of  to cover drilling expenses for the zaniemysl well  in the event costs exceed an agreed upon target amount 
we spent  in related to our proved properties and oilfield equipment in the united states 
during  the bulk of cash used was for upgrading our producing oil and gas properties and our well servicing equipment 
during  our capital expenditures for producing properties and well servicing equipment were offset by million in maturing marketable debt securities 
financing activities 
we received net cash of million   and million from our financing activities during  and  respectively 
during  we received a total of million in net proceeds from the sale of securities 
these proceeds were offset by million paid to rrpv  million of which was a principal payment on its note payable  and  of which was a loan extension fee paid in march during  we received million pertaining to our rrpv loan and gas purchase option agreement 
we believe that our capital resources from existing cash balances are adequate to meet the requirements of our business through  and that we have adequate liquidity to maintain our operations as they currently exist 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  contractual obligations and commitments due by december  in thousands fences i work commitment  total  the fences i work commitment is required in order for us to earn a interest in the fences i project area 
we expect that the balance of our earning requirement will be met by the approximately million in costs paid by calenergy gas associated with the zaniemysl well  the costs of drilling the initial test well on the rusocin prospect  and the acquisition and reprocessing of additional seismic in the fences i area scheduled for our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations  personal injury  and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states operations and rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration participants in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
new accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our results of operations or financial position 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s price risk realized pricing for our oil production in the united states is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our oil production in the united states is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
we currently have no gas production in poland 
previously  our gas in poland was sold to pogc based on us dollar pricing under a five year contract 
the limited volume and sources of our gas production means we cannot assure uninterruptible production or production in amounts that would be meaningful to industrial users  which may depress the price we may be able to obtain 
there is currently no competitive market for the sale of gas in poland 
accordingly  we expect that the prices we receive for the gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in a competitive setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices  at least until a fully competitive market develops in poland 
we currently do not engage in any hedging activities or have any derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although we may elect to do so if we achieve a significant amount of production in poland 
foreign currency risk we have entered into various agreements in poland  primarily in us dollars or the us dollar equivalent of the polish zloty 
we conduct our day to day business on this basis as well 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
we do not currently engage in hedging transactions to protect ourselves against foreign currency risks  nor do we intend to do so in the foreseeable future
