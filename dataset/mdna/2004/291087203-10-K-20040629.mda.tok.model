during fiscal and  of emerson s purchases consisted of imported finished goods from manufacturers primarily located in south korea  china  malaysia  and thailand 
emerson s design team is responsible for product development and works closely with emerson s suppliers 
emerson s engineers determine the detailed cosmetic  electronic and other features for new products  which typically incorporate commercially available electronic parts to be assembled according to their design 
accordingly  the exterior designs and operating features of the products reflect emerson s judgment of current styles and consumer preferences

returned products emerson s customers return product to emerson for a variety of reasons  including retailer return policies with their customers  damage to goods in transit and cosmetic imperfections  and mechanical failures 
emerson has entered into agreements with the majority of its suppliers that require the supplier to accept returned defective product 
emerson pays a fee to the supplier and in exchange receives a unit 
backlog we do not believe that backlog is a significant factor in our consumer electronics segment

see consumer electronics segment licensing and related activities 
competition as published in the consumer electronics association market research report  the market segments of the consumer electronics industry in which emerson competes generates approximately billion of factory sales annually and is highly fragmented  cyclical and very competitive 
the industry is characterized by the short life cycle of products  which requires continuous design and development efforts 
emerson primarily competes in the low to medium priced sector of the consumer electronics market 
management estimates that emerson has several dozen competitors that are manufacturers and or distributors  many of which are much larger and have greater financial resources than emerson 
emerson competes primarily on the basis of its reliability  quality  price  design  consumer acceptance of its products  and quality service and support to retailers and their customers 

table of contents emerson also competes at the retail level for shelf space and promotional displays  all of which have an impact on its established and proposed distribution channels 
seasonality emerson generally experiences stronger demand from its customers for its products in the fiscal quarters ending september and december 
however  during the last several years  this revenue pattern has been less prevalent due to the need for retailers to plan earlier for the winter holiday selling season and our management s ability to obtain additional orders to meet additional product demand during the march and june fiscal quarters 
working capital our consumer electronics segment is impacted by its seasonality in that it generally records the majority of annual sales in the quarters ending september and december  requiring it to maintain higher inventory levels during the quarters ending june and september  therefore increasing the working capital needs during these periods 
management believes that the outward license agreements  sales margin stability and the policies in place for returned products should continue to favorably impact our cash flow 
management believes that anticipated cash flow from operations and the financing presently in place will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its operating and debt service cash requirements in the year ahead 
management believes the company s working capital practices are similar to those of its competitors 
sporting goods segment general management believes ssg is a leading direct mail marketer of sports related equipment and leisure products for sale primarily to the institutional market in the united states 
from july through october  certain of ssg s team dealer locations were discontinued 
in november  ssg sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of it s wholly owned subsidiary  athletic training equipment company  inc atec 
collectively  ssg refers to these as discontinued operations and accordingly  the accompanying financial statements reflect these as discontinued operations 
these transactions helped reduce the overhead of ssg along with providing funds to reduce the debt of ssg 
products management believes ssg manufactures and distributes one of the broadest lines of sporting goods  physical educational  recreational and leisure products to the institutional market 
ssg offers over  products  of which ssg manufactures approximately  of these products and the remainder are purchased from other manufacturers 
the ssg product lines include archery  baseball  softball  basketball  camping  football  tennis and other racquet sports  gymnastics  indoor recreation  game tables and physical education  soccer  field and floor 
table of contents hockey  lacrosse  track and field  volleyball  weight lifting  fitness equipment  outdoor playground equipment  and early childhood development products 
management believes brand recognition is important to the institutional market 
most of ssg s products are marketed under trade names or trademarks owned or licensed by ssg and include the following alumagoal blastball bsn champion barbell curvemaster fibersport flag a tag gamecraft gsc sports maxpro macgregor new england camp supply northamerican recreation passon s sports pillo polo port a pit pro base pro down pro net rol dri and tidi court toppleball us games  inc voit growth strategy ssg believes it is well positioned to grow its business due to its ability to process and fulfill a high capacity of orders  its well developed expertise in catalog design and merchandising  and its information technology system and its internet platform 
one of the most important contributions of ssg s information technology platform is that the order processing and fulfillment capabilities are integrated throughout the operations of ssg  including all of ssg s websites 
each website is strategically targeted to a specific customer group or product line 
the continued migration of ssg s customers to its websites is important to ssg s growth and success 
sales and distribution ssg s websites enable its customers to place orders  access account information  track orders  and perform routine customer service inquiries on a real time basis  twenty four hours a day  seven days a week 
this functionality allows for more convenience and added flexibility for its customers 
ssg s sourcing  warehousing  distribution and fulfillment capabilities and its fully integrated information system  provide the necessary capacities  logistics  information and technological capabilities to meet the demands and growth potential of commerce 

table of contents domestic marketing ssg offers products directly to the institutional market primarily through a variety of distinctive  information rich catalogs  sales personnel strategically located in certain large metropolitan areas  in bound and out bound telemarketers  a team of experienced bid and quote personnel  and the internet 
ssg s marketing efforts are supported by a database of over  customers  a call center  a custom designed distribution center and several manufacturing facilities 
ssg currently offers approximately  sports related equipment products to over  customers  which include public and private schools  colleges  universities and military academies  municipal and governmental agencies  military facilities  churches  clubs  camps  hospitals  youth sports leagues  non profit organizations  team dealers  and certain large retail sporting goods chains 
ssg believes that its customer base in the united states is the largest in the institutional direct mail market for sports related equipment 
licensing and related activities ssg has inward licenses for certain well known names and trademarks that allow it to manufacture  sell  and distribute specified sport related products and equipment to institutional customers using the licensed names for specified royalty fees paid to licensors 
see business sporting goods segment trademarks 
design and manufacturing ssg manufactures  assembles and distributes many of its products at its facilities 
see item properties 
most of ssg s manufactured products are standardized 
certain products manufactured by ssg are custom made  such as tumbling mats ordered in color or size specifications 
the principal raw materials used by ssg in manufacturing are  for the most part  readily available from several different sources 
no one supplier accounts for more than of the total raw materials supplied to ssg 
such raw materials include foam  vinyl  nylon thread  steel and aluminum tubing 
items not manufactured by ssg are purchased from various suppliers primarily located in the united states  taiwan  australia  the philippines  thailand  china  pakistan  sweden and canada 
ssg has no significant purchase contracts with any major supplier of finished products  and most products purchased from suppliers are available from other sources 
purchases of most finished products are made in us dollars and are  therefore  not subject to direct foreign exchange rate differences 

table of contents warranties ssg typically offers limited warranties for its sporting goods  which are comparable to its competitors 
returned products in most instances  ssg s customers have the right to return product within days 
returned products in the sporting goods segment are less frequent than the consumer electronics segment  and are not considered a significant factor in ssg s operations 
backlog ssg had a backlog of approximately million at march   million at march   and million at march  trademarks ssg licenses certain well known trade names and trademarks allowing it to manufacture  sell  and distribute specified sport related products and equipment to institutional customers using these names for specified royalty fees 
these license agreements have expiration dates ranging from december through  in some cases with renewable terms and include our license with macgregor  which expires in and allows us to manufacture  promote  sell and distribute specified products and equipment under the macgregor name 
competition ssg competes in the institutional sporting goods market principally with local sporting goods dealers  retail sporting goods stores  other direct mail catalog marketers  and providers of sporting goods on the internet 
ssg has identified approximately other direct mail and internet companies in the institutional market most of whom management believes are competitors that are substantially smaller than ssg in terms of geographic coverage  products  e commerce capability  customer base and revenues 
ssg competes in the institutional market principally on the basis of brand  price  product availability and customer service 
ssg believes it has an advantage in the institutional market over traditional sporting goods retailers and team dealers because its selling prices do not include comparable price markups attributable to traditional multi distribution channel markups 
in addition  
table of contents ssg s expansive product lines and the ability to control the availability of goods that ssg sources enables it to respond more rapidly to customer demand 
seasonality ssg has historically experienced strong revenues during the march  june and september quarters primarily due to volume generated by spring and summer sports  favorable outdoor weather conditions and school needs before summer closings  and weak revenues during the december quarter 
working capital the sporting goods segment is impacted by seasonality with its march quarter being the highest sales period  and the quarter ending december being its lowest sales period 
this seasonality requires the sporting goods segment to maintain higher amounts of inventory during the quarters ending march and june  therefore increasing the working capital needs during these periods 
government regulation pursuant to the tariff act of  as amended  the trade act of and regulations promulgated there under  the united states government charges tariff duties  excess charges  assessments and penalties on many imports 
these regulations are subject to constant change and revision by government agencies and by action by the united states trade representative and may have the effect of increasing the cost of goods purchased by us or limiting quantities of goods available to us from our overseas suppliers 
a number of states have adopted statutes regulating the manner of determining the amount of payments to independent service centers performing warranty service on products such as those sold by us 
additional federal legislation and regulations regarding the importation of consumer electronics products  including the products marketed by us  have been proposed from time to time and  if enacted into law  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
many of our products are subject to federal regulations  among other laws  which empowers the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to protect consumers from hazardous sporting goods and other articles 
the cpsc has the authority to exclude from the market certain articles that are found to be hazardous and can require a manufacturer to refund the purchase price of products that present a substantial product hazard 
cpsc determinations are subject to court review 
similar laws exist in some states and cities in the united states 
product liability and insurance because of the nature of the products sold by us  particularly those products sold by ssg  we are periodically subject to product liability claims resulting from personal injuries 
we may become involved in various lawsuits incidental to our business 
additionally  significantly increased product liability claims continue to be asserted successfully against manufacturers and distributors of sports 
table of contents equipment throughout the united states resulting in general uncertainty as to the nature and extent of manufacturers and distributors liability for personal injuries 
see item legal proceedings 
in recent years  product liability insurance has become much more expensive  more restrictive and more difficult to obtain 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our general product liability insurance will be sufficient to cover any successful product liability claims made 
in our opinion  any ultimate liability arising out of currently pending product liability claims will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations 
however  any claims substantially in excess of the insurance coverage  or any substantial claim not covered by insurance  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
employees as of may   we had approximately employees  of which were employed by emerson  and were employed by ssg 
none of our employees are represented by unions  and we believe our labor relations are good 
risk factors you should carefully consider these risk factors in addition to our financial statements  including the notes to such financial statements 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
business related risks the loss  or significant reduction in business of any of our key customers  including wal mart and target  could negatively affect our revenues and could decrease our earnings 
we are highly dependent upon sales of our consumer electronic products to certain of our customers  including wal mart and target 
during our fiscal years ended march  and  wal mart stores accounted for approximately and  respectively  target stores accounted for approximately and  respectively  and for fiscal  k mart accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
although no other customer in either of our operating segments accounted for greater than of our consolidated net revenues during these periods  other customers may account for more than of our consolidated net revenues in future periods 
all purchases of our products by customers in both of our operating segments are made through purchase orders and we do not have any long term contracts with any of our customers 
the loss of wal mart or target  or any of our other customers to which we sell a significant amount of our products or any significant portion of orders from wal mart or target  or such other customers or any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers could negatively affect our revenues and decrease our earnings 
the failure to maintain our relationships with our licensees and distributors or the failure to obtain new licensees or distribution relationships could negatively affect our revenues and decrease our earnings 

table of contents we maintain license agreements that allow licensees to use our emerson and hh scott trademarks for the manufacture and sale of consumer electronics and other products 
in addition  we maintain distribution agreements for the distribution of our consumer electronics products into defined geographic areas 
although we have entered into agreements with certain of our licensees and distributors of consumer electronics products  most of which have a term of three years or less and expire between november and december  we cannot assure that such agreements will be renewed when the terms of such agreements expire  or that our relationships with our licensees or distributors will be maintained on satisfactory terms or at all 
the failure to maintain our relationships with funai and our other licensees and distributors  the failure to obtain new licensees or distribution relationships or the failure by our licensees to protect the integrity and reputation of our emerson and hh scott trademarks could negatively affect our licensing revenues and decrease our earnings 
our sporting goods business licenses certain well known names and trademarks  including macgregor that expires in  and allows us to manufacture  promote  sell and distribute specified products and equipment 
although the macgregor agreement expires in  we cannot be assured that our relationship with macgregor will be maintained on satisfactory terms or at all 
the non renewal or termination of one or more of our material licenses in our sporting goods business could materially reduce our ability to sell products bearing such names and trademarks and decrease our earnings 
our revenues and earnings could be negatively affected if we cannot anticipate market trends or enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of new products 
our success is dependent on our ability to successfully anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner 
in addition  to increase our penetration of current markets and gain footholds in new markets for our products  we must maintain existing products and integrate them with new products 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products that respond to technological developments or changing customer needs and preferences 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these new products 
in addition  these new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements to our products are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our sales volume may decline and earnings could be negatively affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of our products  which could also negatively affect our revenues and earnings 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for our components and raw materials and any interruption in the availability of these components and raw materials used in our products could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship with our customers 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers  most of which are located outside of the united states  for the components and raw materials used in our consumer electronics and sporting good products 
although there are many suppliers for each of our component parts and raw materials  we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for many of the significant components and raw materials 
this reliance involves a number of significant risks  including 
table of contents lack of availability of materials and interruptions in delivery of components and raw materials from our suppliers  manufacturing delays caused by such lack of availability or interruptions in delivery  fluctuations in the quality and the price of components and raw materials  in particular due to the petroleum price impact on such materials  and risks related to foreign operations 
we do not have any long term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of our suppliers 
starlite  avatar mfg  gmt industries  daewoo and lasco industries are our largest suppliers of components for our consumer electronics products  each of which accounted for more than of our purchases of components for our consumer electronics products for our latest fiscal year 
our failure to maintain existing relationships with our suppliers or to establish new relationships in the future could also negatively affect our ability to obtain our components and raw materials used in our products in a timely manner 
if we are unable to obtain ample supply of product from our existing suppliers or alternative sources of supply  we may be unable to satisfy our customers orders which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship with our customers 
the operating results of our sporting good segment may continue to be affected by budgetary restrictions of schools and government agencies 
a substantial portion of our sporting goods product revenues are generated through sales to the institutional market  including public and private schools  colleges and universities  military academies  municipal and governmental agencies  military and correctional facilities  youth sports leagues 
as a result  our sporting goods business is substantially dependent on the budgetary allowances of schools as well as local  state and federal government agencies 
restrictions or reductions to the budgeted spending of these entities could reduce the amount of goods purchased from us and could materially adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
if our original equipment manufacturers are unable to deliver our products in the required amounts and in a timely fashion  we could experience delays or reductions in shipments to our customers which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship with our customers 

table of contents all of our consumer electronic products and approximately of our sporting good products are manufactured in accordance with our specifications by original equipment manufacturers located in south korea  china  malaysia  and thailand 
if we are unable to obtain our products from the original equipment manufacturers located in these countries in the required quantities and quality and in a timely fashion  we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments to our customers which could negatively affect our ability to meet the requirements of our customers  as well as our relationships with our customers 
unanticipated disruptions in our operations or slowdowns by our suppliers  manufacturers and shipping companies could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products and service our customers which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship with our customers 
our ability to provide high quality customer service  process and fulfill orders and manage inventory depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our call center  distribution center and manufacturing facilities related to our sporting goods segment  and the timely and uninterrupted performance of third party manufacturers and suppliers  shipping companies  and dock workers relating to both our consumer electronics and sporting goods segments 
any material disruption or slowdown in the operation of our call center  distribution center  manufacturing facilities or management information systems  or comparable disruptions or slowdowns suffered by our principal manufacturers  suppliers and shippers could cause delays in our ability to receive  process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled  lost or delivered late  goods to be returned or receipt of goods to be refused 
our sporting goods segment ships approximately of its products using united parcel service 
a strike by ups or any of our other major carriers or any other disruption in our ability or our customer s ability to receive our products as a result of a strike or otherwise could materially adversely affect our results of operations as a result of our failure to deliver our products in a timely manner and using other more expensive freight carriers 

table of contents the operations of our sporting goods segment are subject to high fixed costs  which could adversely affect our earnings 
the operations and maintenance of our call center  distribution center  manufacturing facilities and management information systems related to our sporting goods segment involve substantial fixed costs 
paper and postage are significant components of our sporting goods segment operating costs 
catalog mailings entail substantial paper  postage  and costs associated with catalog development  each of which is subject to price fluctuations 
if net revenues are substantially below expectations  these fixed costs may not be proportionately reduced and could materially adversely affect the earnings of our sporting goods segment and  in turn  our consolidated earnings 
our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected by foreign regulations and changes in the political  public health and economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we operate our business 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of products manufactured by third parties located primarily in china  south korea  malaysia and thailand 
in addition  third parties located in these and other countries located in the same region produce and supply many of the components and raw materials used in our products 
conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and could subject us to increased costs 
the main factors that may adversely affect our revenues and increase our costs are currency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price of the components and raw materials used in our products and a decrease in our profits  more stringent export restrictions in the countries in which we operate which could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products to our customers  tariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more expensive for us to obtain and deliver our products to our customers  political instability and economic downturns in these countries which could adversely affect our ability to obtain our products from our manufacturers or deliver our products to our customers in a timely fashion  and seasonal reductions in business activity in these countries during the summer months which could adversely affect our sales 
in addition  the prior outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  which had particular impact in china  hong kong and singapore  had a negative effect on our consumer electronics operations 
our operations  including our ability to obtain our products in a timely fashion  could be impacted again  including disrupting the operation of our suppliers  manufacturers and shipping companies  each of which could adversely affect our earnings  should sars reoccur in the future 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  many of these risks and cannot predict the impact of any particular risk on our operations 
however  any of these factors may materially adversely affect our revenues and or increase our operating expenses 

table of contents the seasonality of our business  as well as changes in consumer spending and economic conditions  may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline 
our net revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the main factors that may cause these fluctuations are seasonal variations in operating results  variations in the sales of our products to our significant customers  increases in returned consumer electronics products in the march quarter which follows our peak september and december selling quarters  variations in manufacturing and supplier relationships  if we are unable to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements from quarter to quarter  we may not have sufficient inventory to deliver our products to our customers in a timely fashion or we may have excess inventory that we are unable to sell  the discretionary nature of our customers demands and spending patterns  changes in market and economic conditions  and competition 
in addition  our quarterly operating results could be materially adversely affected by political instability  war  acts of terrorism or other disasters 
sales of our consumer electronics products are somewhat seasonal due to consumer spending patterns  which tend to result in significantly stronger sales in our september and december fiscal quarters  especially as a result of the holiday season 
our sporting goods segment is also somewhat seasonal due to stronger demand for its products during the march fiscal quarter due to volume generated by spring and summer sports  favorable outdoor weather conditions and school needs before summer closings and weaker revenues during the december fiscal quarter 
these patterns will probably not change significantly in the future 
although we believe that the seasonality of our business is based primarily on the timing of consumer demand for our products  fluctuations in operating results can also result from other factors affecting us and our competitors  including new product developments or introductions  availability of products for resale  competitive pricing pressures  changes in product mix and pricing and product reviews and other media coverage 
due to the seasonality of our business  our results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of our results for the year 
our sales and earnings can also be affected by changes in the general economy since purchases of consumer electronics and sporting goods are generally discretionary for consumers and subject to budgetary constraints by schools and government agencies 
our success is influenced by a number of economic factors affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  
table of contents business conditions  budgetary restrictions of schools and government agencies  interest rates and taxation rates 
adverse changes in these economic factors  among others  may restrict consumer spending or increase budgetary restrictions at schools and government agencies  thereby negatively affecting our sales and profitability 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter are subject to significant variation  which may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
if our third party sales representatives fail to adequately promote  market and sell our consumer electronic products  our revenues could significantly decrease 
a portion of our consumer electronic product sales are made through third party sales representative organizations  whose members are not our employees 
our level of sales depends on the effectiveness of these organizations  as well as the effectiveness of our own employees 
some of these third party representatives may sell  with our permission  competitive products manufactured by other third parties as well as our products 
during our fiscal years ended march  and  these organizations were responsible for approximately and  respectively  of our net consumer electronics revenues during such periods 
in addition  two of these representative organizations were responsible for a significant portion of these revenues 
if any of our third party sales representative organizations engaged by us  especially our two largest  fails adequately to promote  market and sell our consumer electronics products  our revenues could be significantly decreased until a replacement organization or distributor could be retained by us 
finding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consuming process during which our revenues could be negatively impacted 
the ownership of our common stock by geoffrey p 
jurick  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  substantially reduces the influence of our other stockholders 
geoffrey jurick  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  geoffrey jurick currently has the ability to influence significantly the actions that require stockholder approval  including the election of our directors  and the approval of mergers  sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval 
as a result  our other stockholders may have little or no influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval 
in addition  the selling stockholder s influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and consequently materially adversely affect the price of our common stock 
however  in march  a judgment was entered against mr 
jurick in favor of petra stelling in the amount of approximately million  plus interest  and in connection with such judgment  shares of our common stock  or of our outstanding common stock  registered in the name of mr 
jurick were placed in escrow with mr 
jurick s counsel for the benefit of the parties 

table of contents we may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our management s attention and our capital resources 
we may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of related businesses 
such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our earnings  including the diversion of our management s attention from our everyday business activities  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business  the incurring of additional expenses related to such acquisitions  whether or not such acquisitions are consummated  the contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of  and other unanticipated problems arising in  the acquired business  and the need to expand management  administration and operational systems 
if we make such acquisitions  we cannot predict whether we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business  we will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions  or there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions 
in addition  future acquisitions by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and the recognition of significant charges for depreciation and amortization related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we continuously evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses 
however  competition for such potential acquisitions is intense and we have not reached any agreement or arrangement with respect to any particular acquisition and we may not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents we are subject to intense competition in the industries in which we operate which could cause material reductions in the selling price of our products or losses of our market share 
the consumer electronics industry and the institutional market for sporting goods and leisure products are highly competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features 
our consumer electronics segment competes in the low to medium priced sector of the consumer electronics market and competes primarily on the basis of reliability  quality  price  design  consumer acceptance of the emerson trademark  and quality service and support to retailers and our customers 
our sporting goods segment competes in the institutional sporting goods market principally with local sporting goods dealers  retail sporting goods stores  other direct mail catalog marketers and providers of sporting goods on the internet 
our sporting goods segment competes principally on the basis of brand  price  product availability  and customer service 
in recent years we and many of our competitors have regularly lowered prices  and we expect these pricing pressures to continue 
if these pricing pressures are not mitigated by increases in volume  cost reductions or changes in product mix  our revenues and profits could be substantially reduced 
as compared to us  many of our competitors have significantly longer operating histories  significantly greater managerial  financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources  and greater name recognition 
as a result  our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services  and respond more effectively to pricing pressures 

table of contents these factors could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
in addition  competition could increase if new companies enter the market  existing competitors expand their product mix  or we expand into new markets 
an increase in competition could result in material price reductions or loss of our market share 
our business could be adversely affected if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary rights 
we own the emerson trademark  which is materially important to our business  as well as our other trademarks and proprietary rights that are used for certain of our home entertainment and consumer electronics products 
in addition  we license names and trademarks in connection with our sporting goods business 
our trademarks are registered throughout the world  including the united states  canada  mexico  france  spain  germany and the united kingdom 
however  third parties may seek to challenge  invalidate  circumvent or render unenforceable any proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us 
in addition  in the event third party licensees fail to protect the integrity of our trademarks  the value of these marks could be adversely affected 
the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws in the united states 
the protections afforded by the laws of such countries may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights 
our inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect the license of our tradenames and trademarks to third parties as well as our ability to sell our products 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  and determine the scope and validity of such intellectual property rights 
any such litigation  whether or not successful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management s attention from the operation of our business 
we may receive notice of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
such actions could result in litigation and we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending such claims 
the party making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief 
such relief could effectively block our ability 
table of contents to make  use  sell  distribute or market our products and services in such jurisdiction 
we may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectual property 
we cannot predict  however  whether such licenses would be available or  if available  that such licenses could be obtained on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale  manufacture or distribution of our products and could result in increased costs to us 
we could be exposed to product liability or other claims for which our product liability or other insurance may be inadequate 
a failure of any of the products marketed by us  particularly those products sold by our sporting goods segment  may subject us to the risk of product liability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedly caused by the improper functioning or design of our products 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance in amounts which we consider adequate  we cannot assure that our insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities  adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future  or our insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms 
we and certain of our officers and directors  are party to a class action lawsuit and we cannot assure the outcome of such litigation 
although we maintain liability insurance in amounts that we consider adequate  we cannot assure that such policies will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
to the extent product liability or other litigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of our insurance coverage  our expenses could materially increase 
see item legal proceedings 
the inability to use our tax net operating losses could result in a charge to earnings and could require us to pay higher taxes 
both emerson and ssg have substantial tax net operating losses available to reduce taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes 
a portion of the benefit associated with the tax net operating losses has been recognized as a deferred tax asset in our financial statements and could be used to reduce our tax liability in future profitable periods 
we believe these net deferred tax assets will be realized through tax planning strategies available in future periods and future profitable operating results 
although realization is not assured at either emerson or ssg  we believe it is more likely than not that all of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced or eliminated in the near term if certain tax planning strategies are not successfully executed  or estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period is reduced 
in addition  transactions consummated by us or geoffrey jurick  that together with other transactions consummated by emerson  ssg or mr 
jurick or that involve the common stock of emerson or ssg that are deemed collectively to result in a change of control of emerson or ssg  
table of contents respectively  under the tax code could limit the use of our tax net operating losses 
in the event that either emerson or ssg is unable to utilize its tax net operating losses in a reasonable time frame  it would be required to adjust its deferred tax asset on its financial statements which would result in a charge to earnings 
additionally  should the utilization of tax net operating losses be limited  we would be required to pay a greater amount of taxes in future periods 
our existing indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns 
from time to time we incur debt in connection with our operations 
as a result  we may be subject to the risks associated with indebtedness  including we must dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs and  as a result  we have less funds available for operations and other purposes  it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds through financings  if available at all  we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates  less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions  and if we default under any of our existing credit facilities or if our creditors demand payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our borrowings under our credit facilities and are subject to covenants that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
our indebtedness under our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
if we default under the indebtedness secured by our assets  those assets would be available to the secured creditor to satisfy our obligations to the secured creditor 
in addition  our credit facilities impose certain restrictive covenants  including financial  ownership  operational and net worth covenants 
failure to satisfy any of these covenants could result in all or any of the following acceleration of the payment of our outstanding indebtedness  our inability to borrow additional amounts under our existing financing arrangements  and our inability to secure financing on favorable terms or at all from alternative sources 
any of these consequences could significantly reduce the amount of cash and financing available to us which in turn would adversely affect our ability to operate our business  including acquiring our products from our manufacturers and distributing our products to our customers 

table of contents market related risks the market price of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations from time to time

furthermore  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our organizational documents and delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management 
several provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt  including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock 
under the terms of our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
the ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors

consistent with the stipulation and order  the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint the amended complaint that  among other things  added jerome farnum  one of our directors  as a defendant in the litigation 
generally  the amended complaint alleges that we and the individual defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  and rule b promulgated there under  by i issuing certain positive statements during the class period regarding our ability to replace lost revenues attributable to our hello kitty license and ii omitting to disclose that we suffered allegedly soured relationships with our largest retail customers 
the amended complaint further alleges that these statements were materially false and misleading when made because we allegedly misrepresented and omitted certain adverse facts which then existed and disclosure of which was necessary to make the statements not false and misleading 
we  and the individual defendants intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously 
other matters we are a party to various other litigation matters  in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business
