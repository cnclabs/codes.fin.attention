item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction novell  inc has been a thought leader in the field of computer networking since our development and release of netware in building on this foundation  we recently acquired two companies that are key players in the linux market 
as a result of our years of experience as a leader in the field of computer networking  and the expertise in the companies that we recently acquired  we believe we employ some of the best engineers in the world 
these engineers  in collaboration with our consulting professionals  create world class information technology it solutions 
we are proud of our people  their skills  and the dedication they give the company 
leveraging this expertise  we expect to continue the evolution of our cross platform strategy and become a leader in providing cross platform solutions  web services  and identity management 
during fiscal  we announced our strategy to support linux as well as netware  giving our customers a choice by providing novell products and services that run on both netware and linux platforms 
our solutions leverage our network expertise and the web to help to create a world without information boundaries 
on january   we acquired suse  a privately held company and leading distributor of commercial linux for enterprise servers 
the acquisition of suse expands our ability to support and distribute a complete package of linux solutions and provides us the ability to offer the most complete open source application stack available 
on august   we acquired ximian  a privately held company and leading provider of desktop and server solutions that enable enterprise linux adoption 
the acquisition of ximian expands our ability to support linux solutions  providing us with linux desktop  groupware and management technologies 
the acquisition also brings leaders in the open source community and a strong core of linux developers to novell 
with the acquisitions of suse and ximian  we believe we will be the only vendor who can provide complete  industry leading network services on linux from the server to the desktop  giving organizations a safe  secure  reliable  mature  and proven approach with worldwide enterprise level support for investing in linux 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires us to make an accounting estimate based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially change the financial statements 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  and valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition 
revenue from software license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
allowances for estimated sales returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenue 
we recognize revenue on the sale of shrink wrapped box product through our distributor channel on a sell through basis 
revenue from maintenance contracts  support and other similar services  is recognized as services are performed 
certain sales require continuing service  support and performance by us  and accordingly  a portion of the revenue is deferred until the future service  support  and performance are provided 
revenue recognized on multiple element arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements  which may include software products  unspecified product upgrade protection  software support services  consulting  and training 
fair value is determined by vendor specific objective evidence of the novell annual report 
table of contents price charged to other customers when each element is sold separately 
we have established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all elements of a multiple element arrangement 
consulting project contracts are either time and materials or fixed price contracts 
revenue from consulting projects is recognized only if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized using the proportional performance method  using the estimated time to completion to measure the percent complete 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percent complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
we record provisions against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
we also record a provision to operating expenses for bad debts resulting from customers inability to pay for the products or services they have received  due to such factors as bankruptcy 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and bad debt expense  analyses of credit memo data  and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns or bad debts  revenue or net income could be overstated or understated 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets include fixed assets  long term investments  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
at october   our long lived assets included million of net fixed assets  million of long term investments  million of goodwill  and million of identifiable intangible assets 
property  plant  and equipment 
we periodically review our property  plant  and equipment for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding recoverability of costs  estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that our facilities in san jose  california and a small building in provo  utah had become impaired due to changes in the intended use of the facilities  as well as changes in the local commercial real estate market 
accordingly  an independent real estate consulting firm was retained to appraise the facilities 
this resulted in a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our san jose facility to a san jose based company looking to remain in the area and seeking to satisfy specific space requirements 
as a result  we were able to sell the facility for more than anticipated  and we recorded a million operating gain on the sale 
long term investments 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the actual financial performance of the companies or venture funds in which we have invested  the investee s market value  and the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these private equity investments  we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of our investees  liquidation preference value of the stock we hold  and estimated potential for investment recovery based on all these factors 
if any of these factors indicate that the investment has become other than temporarily impaired  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
during fiscal we recognized million of impairment losses related to our long term investments 
if general market conditions do not improve  or if any of the companies or venture funds included in long term investments do not meet performance goals  our investments could become other than temporarily impaired as their values decline  causing us to record further investment impairment charges 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points novell annual report 
table of contents throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if actual cash flows are below our estimates  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on november   we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and therefore  we were required to perform an impairment test on our goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives during the first six months of fiscal and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
our initial goodwill impairment analysis was completed during the second quarter of fiscal and was based on november  balances 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge of million related to goodwill 
subsequently  during the fourth quarters of fiscal and fiscal  we completed our annual impairment review based on august  and balances and determined that there was no impairment as of those dates 
however  changes in the assumptions used in the analysis could have changed the resulting outcome 
for example  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  we made estimates and judgments about future cash flows based on our fiscal forecast and current long range plans used to manage the business 
these long range estimates could change in the future depending on internal changes in our company as well as external factors 
future changes in estimates could possibly result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that impairment indicators existed related to the developed technology and trade names we acquired from silverstream  mainly as a result of failure to achieve revenue growth targets for the extend products 
based on an independent valuation of these assets  we recorded a million impairment charge to write down these assets to their estimated fair value 
this charge is included in cost of revenue 
as a result of the impairment recorded on these intangible assets  we also analyzed our other long lived assets for indicators of impairment  as required by sfas no 
 in the third quarter 
this analysis included goodwill and fixed assets acquired from silverstream 
applying the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
for goodwill and property  plant and equipment  respectively  we noted no additional indicators of impairment  as previously noted 
developed technology is amortized over three years as a cost of revenue 
amortization for fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
trade names have an indefinite life and therefore are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
deferred tax assets 
we perform quarterly and annual assessments of the realization of our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
as a result of these assessments  we previously established valuation allowances on select deferred tax assets that were considered to be at risk due to their unique characteristics and limitations  such as capital loss carryovers and acquired tax attributes 
through the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the remaining recognized deferred tax assets would be realized 
the valuation allowance established in the fourth quarter of fiscal was recorded as a result of our analysis of the facts and circumstances at that time  which led us to conclude that we could no longer forecast future us taxable income under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s cumulative pre tax book loss for three consecutive years ended october  imposed a high standard for compelling  positive evidence of the likelihood of  and ability to forecast  future taxable income in the near term 
as a result  in the fourth fiscal quarter  we provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets carried on our balance sheet 
as deferred tax assets or liabilities increase or decrease in the future  or if a portion or all of the valuation allowance is no longer deemed to be necessary  the adjustments to the valuation allowance will increase or decrease future income tax provisions 
novell annual report 
table of contents results of operations acquisitions ximian  inc pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger by and among novell  foxboro acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of novell foxboro  and ximian on august   we acquired ximian by merging foxboro into ximian with ximian being the surviving corporation 
the value of the acquisition was preliminarily allocated as follows estimated acquisition cost asset life in years in thousands adjusted net tangible assets acquired n a intangible assets purchased in process research and development expensed in fiscal developed technology  years customer relationships years trademarks trade names indefinite goodwill  indefinite goodwill  shown in the table above  includes a million charge to record deferred income tax liability for the future amortization of developed technology and customer relationships 
as a result  developed technology and customer relationships are shown above net of this income tax effect 
the allocation will be adjusted as integration plans are finalized  as allowed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
there are no other outstanding contingencies that could materially affect the allocation 
results of operations of ximian are included in our results of operations beginning august  goodwill from the acquisition resulted from our belief that the technology ximian had developed is valuable to our product offerings 
we also believed it was more beneficial to acquire such technology rather than to develop it in house 
the goodwill from the ximian acquisition has been allocated to our geographic segments and will be included with the cross platform services solutions group of products 
net tangible assets of ximian consisted mainly of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  fixed assets  accounts payable  and other liabilities 
the million of in process research and development pertains to technology that was not currently technologically feasible  meaning it had not reached the working model stage  did not contain all of the major functions planned for the product  and was not ready for initial customer testing 
shortly before the acquisition  ximian released its latest version of each of its products  thus there was minimal in process research and development at the acquisition date 
in process research and development was valued based on discounting forecasted cash flows that will be generated directly from the related products 
completion of development of the future upgrades of these products is dependent upon our delivery of our linux applications products and our successful integration of ximian 
the in process research and development does not have any alternative future use and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
as a result  the entire amount was expensed 
developed technology relates to ximian s products that are commercially available and can be combined with novell products and services 
to determine the value of developed technology  the expected future cash novell annual report 
table of contents flow attributable to the products was discounted taking into account risk associated with these assets relative to the in process research and development 
the analysis resulted in a valuation of approximately million million  net of income tax effect for developed technology  which had reached technological feasibility 
the valuation of customer relationships in the amount of  net of tax  was determined by comparing estimated future cash flows with the relationship in place  versus such cash flows without the relationship in place 
the value of trademarks and trade names was determined based on assigning a royalty rate to the revenue streams that were expected from the products using the ximian trade names 
the royalty rate was determined based on trade name recognition  marketing support  and contribution of the trade name s value relative to the revenue drivers 
the pre tax royalty rate of one percent was applied to the product revenue and discounted to a present value  resulting in a valuation of approximately million million  net of taxes 
silverstream software  inc on july   we purchased almost all of the outstanding shares of silverstream common stock at a price of million 
direct transaction costs were estimated to be million and the fair value  measured using the black scholes model  of silverstream stock options assumed  both vested and unvested  totaled million 
the value of the acquisition was allocated as follows acquisition cost asset life in years in millions adjusted net tangible assets acquired n a deferred compensation years intangible assets purchased in process research and development expensed in fiscal developed technology years trademarks trade names indefinite goodwill indefinite results of operations for silverstream are included in our results of operations beginning july  during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that impairment indicators existed related to the developed technology and trade names we acquired from silverstream  mainly as a result of failure to achieve revenue growth targets for the extend products 
based on an independent valuation of these assets  we recorded a million charge to write down these assets to their determined fair value 
because the intangibles were determined to be impaired  we also analyzed our other long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
this included goodwill and fixed assets acquired from silverstream 
goodwill is reflective of the segment to which it is allocated  not necessarily the company or technology from which it originated thus the analysis of goodwill is performed on geographic segment performance 
no indicators of impairments were noted 
fixed assets consisted mainly of computers and software  none of which had become impaired 
cambridge technology partners on july   the stockholders of cambridge approved the acquisition of cambridge by novell 
we issued shares of our common stock for each share of cambridge common stock outstanding on july  the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the fair value of the consideration was novell annual report 
table of contents approximately million  of which million related to the number of shares exchanged at a per share value of the average closing price of a share of novell common stock for the seven trading day period beginning three days before the announcement date of the acquisition  and million related to direct transaction costs 
the value of the acquisition was allocated as follows acquisition cost in millions adjusted net assets acquired goodwill results of operations for cambridge are included in our results of operations beginning july  our adoption of sfas no 
required us to perform an initial impairment analysis within the first six months following november   the date of adoption 
we completed our goodwill impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal and recognized a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million as of november   which was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue operating segments we sell our products  services  and solutions primarily to large scale corporations  government entities  educational institutions  resellers  and distributors both domestically and internationally 
beginning november   we reorganized our operations and began reporting our financial results in four segments  three are based on geographic areas and the fourth is celerant management consulting 
the geographic segments are americas  emea  and asia pacific 
performance is evaluated by our chief executive officer and our chief decision makers  and is based on reviewing revenue and segment operating income loss information for each of the geographic segments and for the celerant management consulting segment 
financial data for these four reporting segments is not separately available for  with the exception of net revenue as shown below 
the geographic segments are americas includes the united states  canada  and latin america emea includes eastern and western europe  middle east  and africa asia pacific includes china  japan  southeast asia  australia  new zealand  and india we sell our products  services  and solutions primarily to large scale corporations  government entities  educational institutions  resellers  and distributors both domestically and internationally 
the following summarizes revenue by segment change change in millions americas emea asia pacific celerant a net revenue a represents celerant revenue recorded after july  novell annual report 
table of contents revenue in the americas segment decreased by in compared to and decreased by in compared to the decreases in both years are mainly a result of declining netware license maintenance sales  and lower it consulting revenues 
due to the difficult economy in the past two years  corporate it spending in general has been down 
however  netware has also lost market share over that time period as well 
revenue in the emea segment increased by in compared to and increased by in compared to the increases in both years are mainly a result of favorable exchange rates coupled with slight increases in product and it consulting sales 
revenue in the asia pacific segment increased by in compared to and decreased by in compared to the increase in is mainly a result of favorable exchange rates coupled with flat product and services sales 
the decrease in is mainly a result of decreases in product sales 
revenue in the celerant management consulting segment increased by in compared to due to favorable exchange rates and increased demand for their services in difficult economic circumstances 
we only recognized approximately four months of celerant revenue in geographic information sales in the us were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and sales to customers outside the us were million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  sales in emea accounted for and  respectively  of our total sales outside the us no single country outside the us accounted for more than of our total revenue 
solutions categories in addition to reviewing geographic and celerant management consulting segment results  our chief decision makers review net revenue by solution category 
these solution categories are identity management and web services solutions that help customers with their identity management and security issues

cross platform services revenue decreased by in from and decreased by in from the decreases in both and over the previous years were due to decreasing netware licenses and maintenance sales 
the aforementioned decreases in netware sales are also the main reason for the overall decrease in software licenses and maintenance revenue of and in and  respectively 
worldwide services revenue decreased by in from and increased by in from the decrease in over was due to the poor market for consulting services in a difficult economy 
the increase in over was due to the inclusion of revenue from cambridge for a full year 
revenue in the celerant management consulting solution category is discussed previously in the celerant management consulting segment section 
forward looking revenue trends netware revenue for fiscal was down compared to fiscal and was down from fiscal to fiscal these declines are primarily a result of loss of market share 
in fiscal  we expect netware to continue to decrease 
however  as previously discussed  a significant aspect of our overall corporate strategy is to embrace the open source movement  specifically  the linux operating system 
we believe our acquisitions of ximian and suse make us the only major company to offer a complete vertically integrated linux system from server to desktop 
accordingly  we believe that our linux initiatives provide revenue opportunities for the sale of new products and will help assist and augment our existing product revenue streams and trends 
at october  we had million of deferred revenue representing revenue that is expected to be recognized in future periods 
the majority of this deferred revenue relates to maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
we have either received payment or recorded a receivable for the deferred revenue  and have determined collectability to be probable 
direct costs incurred to fulfill these maintenance obligations are recognized as work is performed

gross profit as a percentage of revenue on maintenance and services increased from in to in due to efforts to improve resource utilization in our it consulting services such as elimination of excess capacity 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue on new maintenance and services decreased from in to in due to the inclusion of cambridge for a full year 
consulting services have a lower gross profit margin than maintenance contracts and other services such as training and support 
with the purchase of cambridge in july of  consulting revenue became a larger portion of our maintenance and services revenue resulting in lower overall gross profit margins

these increases were offset somewhat by headcount reductions resulting from the restructurings  which lowered general and administrative headcount by employees  excluding silverstream general and administrative employees 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative costs remained relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher fiscal revenue 
purchased in process research and development relates to the acquisitions of ximian and silverstream and is discussed in the acquisitions section  above 
gain impairment on real property during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that there were indicators of impairment related to our facility in san jose  california and a small building in provo  utah due to the move of most employees from here to other facilities  as well as changes in the local real estate market 
we then performed an analysis of each of the property s future undiscounted cash flows and determined that their estimated future cost recovery was lower than the recorded net book value of the assets 
based on the results of this analysis  we obtained an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of these locations 
based on the fair value of these facilities as determined by the independent appraisals  we recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our facility in san jose  california  for million  which resulted in a realized gain of million 
restructuring third quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million resulting from the restructuring of our operations in response to changes in general market conditions  novell annual report

this strategy includes plans to support linux in addition to netware  by offering our products and services that run on both netware and linux platforms 
these changes in strategy and company structure were made to address the current revenue declines 
specific actions taken included reducing our workforce worldwide by approximately employees approximately across all functions and geographies  with a majority coming from product development  sales  and general and administrative functions  primarily in the united states 
in addition  we consolidated facilities  and disposed of excess equipment 
by reporting segment  the americas accounted for million  emea accounted for million  and asia pacific accounted for million 
as of october   the remaining balance of the third quarter of fiscal restructuring charge included accrued liabilities related to severance and benefits  which will be paid out over the remaining severance obligation period  and redundant facilities  and other fixed contracts  which will be paid over the respective remaining contract terms  and various severed employee related costs  which will be paid over the respective remaining contract terms 
the following table summarizes the activity during fiscal related to this restructuring

the additional accrual relates mainly to the severance of approximately employees and the closing of excess facilities 
such activities occurred mostly in the americas reporting segment 
as a result of the restructuring activities undertaken in fiscal  we expect to reduce our quarterly operating expenses by over million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we also released approximately million related to excess restructuring reserves related to the second quarter fiscal restructuring event 
this release is reflected in the second quarter fiscal table below 
the net impact of the third quarter fiscal restructuring and the release of the excess fiscal restructuring reserves was a charge of million 
second quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that the amount we had originally accrued for facility related costs in previous restructurings was too low and accrued an additional million 
the original liability was based on estimated sublease rates and timing  which have been affected by the decline in the real estate market 
this additional amount  which pertains to three separate restructuring events  is included in the applicable tables that follow 
second quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million

fourth quarter of fiscal at the end of fiscal  we recorded million of pre tax  restructuring charges resulting from changes in general market conditions  changing customer demands  and our evolution of our business strategy  all of which required us to restructure our operations 
this business strategy focused on business solutions designed to secure and power the networked world across leading operating systems 
the execution of this strategy included refining our consulting initiatives  refocusing research and development efforts  defining sales and marketing efforts to be more customer and solutions oriented  and adjusting the overall cost structure given current revenue levels and our direction 
specific actions included reducing our workforce worldwide by approximately  employees approximately  consolidating excess facilities and disposing of excess property and equipment  terminating a management consulting contract that no longer fits with our strategic focus  and abandoning and writing off technologies that no longer fit within our new strategy

income tax expense benefit change change income tax expense benefit millions percentage of revenue effective tax benefit rate the effective tax rate for fiscal significantly changed from the effective tax rate for fiscal primarily as a result of the need for additional valuation allowances in fiscal in the fourth quarter of  we provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets carried on our balance sheet 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of a company s current and previous performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for such a valuation allowance 
under this pronouncement  factors such as current and previous operating losses are given greater weight than the outlook for future profitability in determining deferred tax asset carrying value 
this adjustment will have no impact on our cash flow or future prospects  nor does it alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the future

change in accounting principle effective november   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires the discontinuance of amortization related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
these assets are subject to an impairment test at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
includes provisions requiring the identification of reporting units upon adoption for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments and the performance of an initial impairment analysis within the first six months after adoption 
we completed our goodwill impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal and recognized a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million related to our consulting segment as of november   which was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of operations 
the fiscal change in accounting principle pertains to the change in our methodology for recognizing revenue to distribution channel partners 
liquidity and capital resources october  october  change cash and short term investments millions percentage of total assets cash and short term investments increased to million at october   compared to million at october  we used million of this cash in january in connection with our purchase of suse  excluding merger and transaction costs 
the fiscal net increase in cash is attributed to cash received from the sale of our san jose facility of million  cash provided by operations of million  and cash proceeds from issuances in conjunction with stock option exercises of million  partially offset by cash paid for ximian of million  purchases of fixed assets of million  and expenditures for long term investments of million

our short term investment portfolio includes gross unrealized gains of million as of october  we monitor our investments and record losses when a decline in the investment s market value is determined to be other than temporary 
we also invest excess cash in long term investments through the novell venture account  cambridge technology capital fund i lp ctc i  and directly in equity securities in privately held companies 
investments made through the novell venture account and ctc i are generally in private companies  including small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  and in funds managed by venture capitalists for the promotion of our business and strategic objectives 
as of october   we had a balance of million related to investments in various venture capital funds and had commitments to contribute an additional million to these funds  of which we estimate approximately million could be contributed in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal  and approximately million thereafter as requested by the fund managers 
we  through our acquisition of cambridge  also own both limited and general partnership interests in the ctc i of approximately

repatriation of any portion of this amount would result in united states federal taxable income 
we have provided for the tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes 
repatriation  however  could result in a loss of certain tax attributes of up to million 
we used million of this cash in january in connection with our purchase of suse  reducing the potential loss of these tax attributes 
our principal source of liquidity continues to be from operations  cash on hand  and short term investments 
at october   our principal unused sources of liquidity consisted of cash in the amount of million  short term investments in the amount of million  and available borrowing capacity of approximately million under our lines of credit 
our liquidity needs are principally for financing of accounts receivable  fixed assets  strategic investments  product development  and flexibility in a dynamic and competitive operating environment 
during fiscal  we generated million of cash flow from operations 
we anticipate generating positive cash flows from operations in addition to investment income in fiscal sufficient to fund operations 
we anticipate being able to fund our current operations  any future acquisitions  any further integration  restructuring or any merger related costs  and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future with existing cash and short term investments together with cash generated from operations and investment income 
we believe that borrowings under our credit facilities or offerings of equity or debt securities are possible if the need arises  although such offerings may not be available to us on acceptable terms  given current market conditions 
investments will continue in product development and in new and existing areas of technology 
cash may also be used to acquire technology through purchases and strategic acquisitions 
for example  on january   we purchased suse for approximately million in cash  not including merger and transaction costs 
we also anticipate having adequate cash in fiscal for any necessary capital expenditures

factors affecting future results of operations our future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
a number of these risks and uncertainties are discussed below 
the current economic climate and outlook in the technology and information technology services sector is very weak  causing our business to suffer the weakened global economic climate  particularly in the technology sector  has had an adverse effect on our ability to sell products and services 
future economic projections for this sector are uncertain 
a continuation of the weakened global economy could have further negative effects on our ability to sell products and services in the future 
we may not be able to successfully compete in a challenging market for computer software and consulting services the market for networking applications and solutions as well as it consulting is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to continue to increase both from existing novell annual report 
table of contents competitors and new market entrants 
we believe that competitive factors common to all of our operating segments include our ability to sell both products and services as part of an overall solution  the breadth of our offerings  the pricing of our products and services  and the timing and market acceptance of new solutions developed by us and our competitors 
geographic segments the market for networking applications and solutions as well as it consulting is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to continue to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants 
we believe that competitive factors common to all of our operating segments include our ability to sell both products and services as part of an overall solution  the breadth of our offerings  the pricing of our products and services  and the timing and market acceptance of new solutions developed by us and our competitors 
in addition to the factors listed above  other key competitive factors include brand and product awareness  the performance  reliability and security of our products  the ability to preserve our legacy customer base  the completeness of our suite of product and solutions offerings  our ability to establish and maintain key strategic relationships with distributors  resellers and other partners  and the pricing strategies of our competitors 
our key competitors in our geographic segments include microsoft  ibm  sun  altiris  inc  netegrity  inc  and computer associates 
our competitors in the linux market include bea systems  inc  red hat  and turbolinux  inc 
one pervasive factor facing all companies doing business in our industry is the presence and dominance of microsoft 
in a decision upheld by a federal appellate court  microsoft was found to have violated section of the sherman act by unlawfully acting to maintain its monopoly over desktop operating systems 
we remain concerned  however  that microsoft may continue to engage in business practices that unfairly inhibit the growth of its competitors  including novell  and that the settlement of the litigation between the department of justice and microsoft will not significantly affect microsoft s practices 
this concern seems increasingly to be shared by the department of justice and the litigating states 
for example  in the past  microsoft has employed tactics that limit or block effective and efficient interoperability between novell and microsoft products 
at the most recent status conference in us v 
microsoft held on january   the department of justice expressed concern that the license microsoft is offering for its communications protocols  as required by the court to facilitate interoperability  might not be having the desired effect of fostering competition 
we will ensure  to the best of our ability that our products will interoperate with those of microsoft as they enhance new operating systems and applications 
celerant management consulting segment the key competitive factors faced by the celerant segment are attracting and retaining the highest quality consultants  the depth of our skills and expertise  the breadth of consulting capabilities  and having expertise in key functional areas 
the market for management consulting services is highly competitive due to the existence of various large consulting firms 
many of these companies have greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the consulting area  which could inhibit our ability to grow our consulting business 
additionally  the worldwide marketplace for consulting services is highly fragmented 
in different regions of the world  there may be multiple competitors  many with niche consultancies 
examples of possible competitors include at kearney  mckinsey co  thomas group inc  ibm services  cap gemini  and the management consulting group plc 
if we are not successful in our strategy of taking a competitive position in the linux market  our revenue will not grow at the rate we anticipate a significant aspect of our overall corporate strategy is to embrace the open source movement  specifically  the linux operating system 
it is our goal to stabilize the decline in our netware revenue by offering our customers a clear migration path to linux should they decide to adopt an open source solution  and yet enable them to stay with netware until they are ready to make that decision 
over the past year  we have increasingly demonstrated our commitment to the open source development model  embraced open novell annual report 
table of contents source technologies in our own offerings  invested significant energy and resources in key open source initiatives  and contributed to the open source movement 
we plan to continue to do so in the future 
we are strengthening our ability to sell and support linux in addition to netware 
our ability to achieve success with our linux and open source products and services is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following the growth of the linux market  the acceptance of linux solutions by clients  development of key linux product solutions and upgrades  and the acceptance of those products by large industry partners and major accounts 
if we are unable to grow the linux products and services to become a major component of our business  our long term growth will be negatively impacted 
if we are not successful in developing a strong business with our extend products and services  our revenue will not grow at the rate we anticipate one key element of our strategy is to be a leading force in the development of solutions that make the process of developing open standards  web based applications fast  simple  and cost effective 
our extend solution set leverages the power of standards such as java and xml to unify relevant information and services while enabling customers to leverage prior technology investments and help them rapidly deliver web based applications that are scalable  reliable  and secure 
the acquisition of silverstream helped further our development of web services products and enhanced our business solutions product offerings 
our ability to achieve success with our extend products and services is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following the growth of the web based applications industry  the acceptance of the extend solution set by clients  development of key extend product solutions and upgrades  and the acceptance of those products by large industry partners and major accounts 
if we are unable to grow the extend products and services  our long term growth will be negatively impacted 
our existing product revenue may deteriorate more rapidly than any increase in sales of our new products we have several existing products  which we have been selling and upgrading for many years 
sales of these existing products are declining at a faster rate than we are able to increase sales of new products or technologies 
overall  revenue in the americas segment declined by million in fiscal  primarily as a result of declining netware license and maintenance sales and it consulting sales 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing sales of new products or technologies  particularly in our identity management and web services product line  our long term growth will be negatively impacted 
if we do not generate new customers  our ability to grow our business will be negatively impacted a significant percentage of our revenue is generated from existing customers 
in order to achieve our growth objectives  we must accelerate the rate at which we generate new business 
we have initiated several new sales and marketing initiatives in order to accomplish this goal 
if those initiatives are not successful  our ability to cultivate new customers may be adversely affected 
the legal actions being taken by the sco group could adversely affect our revenues because of a reduction in demand for our suse linux and ximian products sco filed legal action in march against ibm alleging misappropriation of trade secrets  tortious interference  unfair competition and breach of contract relating to ibm s sale of products based on the linux operating system 
among other things  sco maintains that linux is an unauthorized derivative of unix and that portions of unix intellectual property that sco alleges it owns have been included in the linux operating system without authorization 
sco has warned that legal liability for the use of linux may extend to commercial users  and sco has threatened users with litigation and sought licensing fees from them 
it is possible that sco s actions may reduce general demand for linux and linux related products and services 
in this event  demand for our linux products and services could decrease  thereby reducing revenue 
novell annual report 
table of contents our financial and operating results may vary  negatively affecting our ability to detect trends we often experience a higher volume of revenue at the end of each quarter and during our fourth quarter 
because of this  fixed costs that are out of line with revenue levels may not be detected until late in any given quarter and results of operations could be adversely affected 
operating results have been  and may also be  affected by other factors including  but not limited to timing of orders from customers and shipments to customers  product mix  including a shift from higher margin to lower margin products or services  impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the price of our products in international locations  inability to respond to the decline in revenue through the distribution channel  inability to derive benefits from the restructurings and our corporate strategy  and inability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers and systems integration partners 
we have experienced delays in the introduction and acceptance of new products due to various factors as is common in the computer software industry  we have in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products due to a number of factors  including the complexity of software products  the need for extensive testing of software to ensure compatibility of new releases with a wide variety of application software and hardware devices  and the need to debug products prior to extensive distribution 
significant delays in developing  completing  or shipping new or enhanced products would adversely affect us 
moreover  we may experience delays in market acceptance of new releases of our products as we engage in marketing and education of the user base regarding the advantages of and system requirements for new products and as customers evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of upgrading 
we have encountered these issues on each major new release of our products  and expect that we will encounter such issues in the future 
our ability to achieve desired levels of revenue growth depends at least in part on the successful completion  introduction  and sale of new versions of our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others  or that our research and development efforts will be successful 
should we experience material delays or revenue shortfalls with respect to new product releases  our revenue and net income could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel because of the intense competition for qualified personnel in the computer and consulting industries our ability to maintain our competitive technological position will depend  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified development  consulting  and managerial personnel 
even in light of the current economic downturn  competition for personnel of the highest caliber is intense in the software and consulting industries 
the loss of a significant group of key personnel would adversely affect our performance 
the failure to successfully promote and hire suitable replacements in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we are unable to unify our diverse cultures  the benefits of our solutions strategy may not be fully realized we have a talented  energetic  and exciting group of employees 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  a number of these employees come from diverse corporate cultural backgrounds 
we are in the process of a culture initiative to bring us together towards a new common culture that revolves around our solutions offerings 
if we are not successful in forging a new  vibrant culture with unified goals and a common vision that novell annual report 
table of contents is solutions based  employee energies may be diverted or diluted and we may not achieve the full benefits of our solutions strategy 
in the event significant claims are brought under our recently announced novell linux indemnification program  we could incur significant expenses  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
we recently announced our novell linux indemnification program 
under this program  indemnification is offered for copyright infringement claims made by third parties against registered novell customers who obtain suse enterprise linux server and who  after january   obtain upgrade protection and a qualifying technical support contract from us or a participating novell or suse linux channel partner 
although indemnification programs for proprietary software are common in our industry  indemnification programs that cover open source software are not 
copyright infringement claims are not often brought against distributors of open source software  but because of the relatively unique nature of the novell linux indemnification program  the number and extent of claims that might be brought thereunder is uncertain 
sco has threatened to bring claims against end users of linux for copyright violations arising out of the facts alleged in sco s lawsuit against ibm and in sco s public statements  and some of these claims could be indemnified under novell s linux indemnification program 
in the event that claims for indemnification are brought under the novell linux indemnification program  we could incur significant expense reimbursing customers for their legal costs and  in the event those claims are successful  for damages 
if third parties claim that we infringed upon their intellectual property  our ability to use some technologies and products could be limited and we may incur significant costs to resolve these claims litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and software industries 
we have in the past received letters or been the subject of claims suggesting that it is infringing upon the intellectual rights of others 
for example  in may  a suit was filed by france telecom sa and us philips corporation against novell alleging infringement and seeking unspecified damages and an injunction 
in addition  we have faced and expect to continue to face from time to time disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
while we have no knowledge of grounds for any such claims  the cost and time of defending ourselves can be significant 
in addition  we indemnify customers against certain claims that our products infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against infringement claims 
if an infringement claim is successful  we and our customers may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties  and we may be obligated to pay or reimburse our customers for monetary damages 
in such instances  we or our customers may not be able to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or at all  and may face delays in product shipment while developing or arranging for alternative technologies 
we may not be able to protect our confidential information  which may adversely affect our business we generally enter into contractual relationships with our employees that protect our confidential information 
in the event that our trade secrets or other proprietary information is misappropriated  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  we may not be able to timely detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
in the event we are unable to enforce these contractual obligations and our intellectual property rights  our business could be adversely affected 
novell annual report 
table of contents we face increased risks in conducting a global business  which may damage business results we are a multi national corporation with offices and subsidiaries around the world and  as such  we face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically 
certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results including costs and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  longer payment cycles  local political and economic conditions  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which can affect demand and increase our costs 
some of our short term  long term  and venture capital fund investments have become impaired and additional investments could become impaired our investment portfolio includes investments in public equity securities  small capitalization stocks in the high technology industry sector  private companies  and funds managed by venture capitalists 
many of these investments might become other than temporarily impaired 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to some of the investments in our portfolio whose market value had experienced an other than temporary decline 
as of october   we had net unrealized gains  net of taxes  on investments totaling approximately million  however  there can be no assurances that these gains will be realized and that losses will not occur 
if the funds in which we have invested  suffer poor financial performance  or if the private companies in which we have invested are not successfully acquired or experience initial public offerings  the value of our investments will decrease 
our existing relationships with other it services organizations may be impaired and we could lose business we maintain relationships with it services organizations that recommend  design  and implement solutions for their customers ebusiness that include our products 
at the same time  our service offerings compete with those of these same organizations 
although many companies in high technology industries co exist in a similar state of competition  any of these organizations could decide at any time to not continue to do business with us or to not recommend our products 
a change in the willingness of these it service organizations to do business with us could adversely affect our business 
our business may be negatively affected if we do not continue to adapt to rapid technological change  evolving business practices  and changing client requirements the software industry and internet professional services market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving business practices  and changing client needs 
accordingly  our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to adapt and meet these challenges 
among the most important challenges facing us  are the needs to continue to effectively identify and use leading technologies  develop strategic and technical expertise  novell annual report 
table of contents influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technology changes and to orient management teams to capitalize on these changes  recruit and retain qualified project personnel  enhance current services  develop new services that meet changing customer needs  and effectively advertise and market business solutions 
our consulting services contracts contain pricing risks and  if our estimates prove inaccurate  we could lose money our it and celerant consulting businesses derive a portion of their revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts 
because of the complex nature of the services provided  it is sometimes difficult to accurately estimate the cost  scope  and duration of particular client engagements 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required for a project  do not accurately assess the scope of work associated with a project  do not manage the project properly  or do not satisfy our obligations in a manner consistent with the contract  then our costs to complete the project could increase substantially 
we have occasionally had to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  and it may have to take similar action in the future 
we may not be compensated for these additional costs or the commitment of these additional resources 
additionally  our celerant management consulting business derives revenue from projects priced on a contingency basis 
if results are not met  or if a dispute arises  we may not be able to realize a potentially large amount of revenue 
our it and celerant consulting clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with us on short notice if our clients cancel or reduce the scope of an engagement with our it or celerant consulting business  we may be unable to reassign our professionals to new engagements without delay 
personnel and related costs constitute a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
because these expenses are relatively fixed  and because we establish the levels of these expenses well in advance of any particular quarter  cancellations or reductions in the scope of client engagements could result in the under utilization of our professional services employees  causing significant reductions in operating results for a particular quarter 
our stock price will fluctuate our future earnings and stock price could be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
due to analysts expectations of continued growth  any shortfall in anticipated earnings can be expected to have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
revenue fluctuations may also contribute to the volatility of the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
in addition  the market prices for securities of software companies have been  and continue to be  very volatile 
the market price of our common stock  in particular  has been subject to wide fluctuations in the past 
as a result of the foregoing factors and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations within a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer industry or the securities markets in general

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices of equity securities 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts and currency options 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  interest rate risk the primary objective of our short term investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our strategy is to invest in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
market risk we also hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
as of october   gross unrealized gains  before tax effect on the short term public equity securities totaled million 
a reduction in prices of of these short term equity securities would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of our short term investments 
in addition  we invest in equity securities issued by privately held companies that are included in our long term portfolio of investments  primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in thinly capitalized companies in the high technology industry sector or venture capital funds 
because of the nature of these investments  we are exposed to equity price risks 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices of long term equity securities would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our long term securities 
foreign currency risk we use derivatives to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when re measured or settled according to accounting principles generally accepted in the us  impact our consolidated statement of operations 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs 
all forward contracts entered into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
gains and losses on these currency forward contracts would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge  resulting in negligible net gain or loss overall on the hedged exposures 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income expense in the same period as when the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if we did not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement  an increase or decrease of in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this number represents the exposure related to balance sheet re measurement only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
