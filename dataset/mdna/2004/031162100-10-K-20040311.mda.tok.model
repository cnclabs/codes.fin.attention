the company s effective tax rate excluding the effect of non deductible ipr d costs of was lower than the effective rate of primarily due to the puerto rico restructuring described above 
see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
epogen revenue recognition the company has the exclusive right to sell epoetin alfa for dialysis  certain diagnostics  and all non human  non research uses in the united states 
amgen has granted to johnson johnson a license relating to epoetin alfa for sales in the united states for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics 
pursuant to this license  the company and johnson johnson are required to compensate each other for epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party s exclusive market  sometimes referred to as spillover 
accordingly  amgen does not recognize product sales it makes into the exclusive market of johnson johnson and does recognize the product sales made by johnson johnson into amgen s exclusive market 
sales in amgen s exclusive market are derived from the company s sales to its customers  as adjusted for spillover 
the company is employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party s spillover based on independent third party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage 
data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques  and accordingly  the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover 
the company initially recognizes spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage  utilizing historical third party data and subsequently adjusts such amounts based on revised third party data as received 
differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized epogen sales 
however  such differences to date have not been material 
deferred income taxes the company s effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested internationally based on the company s projected cash flow  working capital  and long term investment requirements of its us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact the company s effective future tax rate 
financial outlook results of operations in the near term  the company expects growth of its businesses to be driven primarily by aranesp  neulasta  and enbrel see forward looking statements and factors that may affect amgen 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of as of the date of this filing  the company has not determined the full impact of this new law on its business 
however  the company believes that legislation that reduces reimbursement for its products could adversely impact how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer its products and could negatively impact its business 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect amgen our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payors  and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products 
see products in item business for a discussion of our key products and their approved indications and selected product candidates in item business for a discussion of additional indications under development and subject to regulatory approval 
product sales are influenced by a number of factors  including demand  third party reimbursement availability and policies  wholesaler inventory management practices  foreign exchange effects  new product launches and indications  competitive products  product supply  and acquisitions see forward looking statements and factors that may affect amgen 
epogen the company believes epogen sales growth will primarily depend on patient population growth 
patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
the company believes future epogen sales growth may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government 
epogen may compete with aranesp in the united states as health care providers may use aranesp to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of epogen 
aranesp the company believes future worldwide aranesp sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement by third party payors including governments and private insurance plans  the effects and pricing of competitive products or therapies  penetration of existing and new market opportunities  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  future worldwide sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers 
neulasta neupogen the company believes future worldwide neulasta and neupogen sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement by third party payors including governments and private insurance plans  penetration of existing markets  patient population growth  the conversion of neupogen patients to neulasta  price increases  the effects of competitive products or therapies  the development of new treatments for cancer  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  future worldwide sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers 
further  chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less neulasta neupogen 
neupogen competes with neulasta in the united states and europe 
the company believes that us neupogen sales have and will continue to be adversely impacted by the launch of neulasta 
however  the company believes that the conversion rate has naturally slowed in the us due to the rapid adoption of neulasta 
the company believes that opportunity for conversion exists in europe  but to a lesser extent than experienced in the united states 
the company cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of neupogen patients to neulasta worldwide 
enbrel the company believes that future sales growth of enbrel will be dependent  in part  on such factors as limits on the current supply of and sources of enbrel  the effects of competing products or therapies  penetration of existing and new market opportunities  including potential new indications  and the availability and extent of reimbursement by third party payors 
capital expenditures the company currently estimates spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately billion to billion in  primarily related to the new rhode island manufacturing plant and the puerto rico manufacturing expansion 
trends expected to impact future operations future operating results of the company may be impacted by a number of factors 
the following trends in our business are reasonably expected to impact our future liquidity and results of operations sg a expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to increase over the previous three quarters in a trend similar to that seen in previous years 
reported sales in the first quarter for each of epogen and combined neupogen neulasta have tended to be comparable or slightly less than respective reported sales in the fourth quarter of the previous year 
forward looking statements and factors that may affect amgen this report and other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about us  our future performance  our business or others on our behalf  our beliefs and our management s assumptions 
in addition  we  or others on our behalf  may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements  or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings  webcasts  phone calls  and conference calls

these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
we have based our forward looking statements on our management s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made 
we caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed  implied  or forecast by our forward looking statements 
reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales  expenses  earnings per share  liquidity and capital resources  and trends 
except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec  we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in assumptions  or otherwise 
the following items are representative of the risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payors  and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products are dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments  under programs such as medicare and medicaid in the united states  and private insurance plans 
medicare does not cover prescriptions for enbrel 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls 
in the united states  there have been  there are  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that could limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of pharmaceutical and biologic products 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of as of the date of this filing  we have not determined the full impact of this new law on our business 
however  we believe that legislation that reduces reimbursement for our products could adversely impact how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products  and could negatively impact our business 
in addition  we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products  which may adversely impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic product is approved  the availability of governmental and or private reimbursement for that product is uncertain  as is the amount for which that product will be reimbursed 
we cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our approved products or product candidates  including those at a late stage of development  and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time 
if reimbursement for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our other current or future products  health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them  which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products 
this could result in lower product sales or revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations 
for example  in the united states the use of epogen in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease is funded primarily by the us federal government 
in early  cms  formerly known as hcfa  instituted a reimbursement change for epogen which materially and adversely affected our epogen sales until the policies were revised 
our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval 
we conduct research  preclinical testing  and clinical trials and we manufacture and contract manufacture our product candidates 
we also manufacture and contract manufacture  price  sell  distribute  and market or co market our products for their approved indications 
these activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the united states  such as the fda and cms  as well as in foreign countries  including europe 
currently  we are required in the united states and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries regulatory authorities before we can manufacture or have our third party manufacturers produce product  market and sell our products in those countries 
in our experience  obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years  and after it is obtained  it remains costly to maintain 
the fda and other us and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  require additional testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval  require changes in labeling of our products  and mandate product withdrawals 
substantially all of our marketed products are currently approved in the united states and most are approved in europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses 
we currently manufacture and market all our approved products  and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products 
even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products  these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
in addition  enbrel is manufactured both by us at our rhode island manufacturing facility and by a third party contract manufacturer  bi pharma  and fill and finish of bulk product produced at our rhode island manufacturing facility is done by third party service providers 
bi pharma and these third party service providers are subject to fda regulatory authority 
see limits on supply for enbrel may constrain enbrel sales 
in addition  later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third party service providers could result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  including potential withdrawal of the products from the market 
if regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict  suspend  or revoke our prior approvals  they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third party service providers comply  or indefinitely 
in addition  if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate  then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it 
if we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates  our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if our intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated  circumvented or expire  or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation  our business could be adversely affected 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal  scientific  and factual questions 
to date  there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies patents 
third parties may challenge  invalidate  or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products  product candidates  and technologies 
in addition  our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents 
for certain of our product candidates  there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories 
patent disputes are frequent  costly  and can preclude commercialization of products 
we are currently  and in the future may be  involved in patent litigation 
for example  we are involved in ongoing patent infringement lawsuits against transkaryotic therapies  inc tkt and aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents 
if we lose or settle these or other litigations at certain stages or entirely  we could be subject to competition and or significant liabilities  required to enter into third party licenses for the infringed product or technology  or required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates 
we have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin  recombinant g csf  darbepoetin alfa  pegfilgrastim  etanercept  and our other products and potential products see patents and trademarks in item business 
we market our erythropoietin  recombinant g csf  darbepoetin alfa  pegfilgrastim  and etanercept products as epogen  neupogen  aranesp  neulasta  and enbrel  respectively 
we also have been granted or obtained rights to patents in europe relating to erythropoietin  g csf  pegfilgrastim pegylated g csf  etanercept  two relating to darbepoetin alfa  and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins 
our european patents relating to erythropoietin and g csf expire on december  and august   respectively  and we believe that after the expiration of these patents  other companies could develop and market new competitive products to our products in europe  presenting additional competition to our products 
while we do not market erythropoietin in europe as this right belongs to johnson johnson through ka  we do market aranesp in the eu which competes with johnson johnson s and others erythropoietin products 
we believe that the eu is currently in the process of developing regulatory requirements that would affect the development and approval of new competitive products 
until such requirements are finalized  we cannot predict when new competitive products could appear on the market in the eu or to what extent such additional competition would impact future aranesp and neupogen neulasta sales in the eu 
limits on supply for enbrel may constrain enbrel sales 
us and canadian supply of enbrel is impacted by many manufacturing variables  such as the timing and actual number of production runs  production success rate  bulk drug yield  and the timing and outcome of product quality testing 
for example  in the second quarter of  the prior co marketer with respect to enbrel  experienced a brief period where no enbrel was available to fill patient prescriptions  primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from bi pharma 
if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of enbrel to patients  we may lose patients  physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of enbrel  and enbrel sales will be adversely affected  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
see we are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of enbrel  and our sources of supply are limited 
we are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of enbrel  and our sources of supply are limited 
we currently produce a substantial portion of annual enbrel supply at our rhode island manufacturing facility 
however  we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our enbrel supply as well as for the fill and finish of enbrel that we manufacture 
bi pharma is currently our sole third party manufacturer of enbrel bulk drug  accordingly  our us and canadian supply of enbrel is currently significantly dependent on bi pharma s production schedule for enbrel 
we would be unable to produce enbrel in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in bi pharma s scheduled production if bi pharma or other third party manufacturers used for the fill and finish of enbrel bulk drug were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials  products  or services to us for any reason  including due to labor shortages or disputes  due to regulatory requirements or action  or due to contamination of product lots or product recalls 
this in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for enbrel  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
factors that will affect our actual supply of enbrel at any time include  without limitation  the following bi pharma does not produce enbrel continuously  rather  it produces the drug through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year 
our rhode island manufacturing facility is currently dedicated to enbrel production 
the amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors  including the timing and actual number of bi pharma s production runs  the actual number of runs at our rhode island manufacturing facility  and  for either rhode island or bi pharma facilities  the level of production yields and success rates  the timing and outcome of product quality testing  and the amount of vialing capacity 
bi pharma schedules the vialing production runs for enbrel in advance  based on the expected timing and yield of bulk drug production runs 
therefore  if bi pharma realizes production yields beyond expected levels  or provides additional manufacturing capacity for enbrel  it may not have sufficient vialing capacity for all of the enbrel bulk drug that it produces 
as a result  even if we are able to increase our supply of enbrel bulk drug  bi pharma may not be able to fill and finish the extra bulk drug in time to prevent any supply interruptions 
we are dependent on third parties for fill and finish of enbrel bulk drug manufactured at our rhode island facility 
if third party fill and finish manufacturers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or otherwise unable to provide services to us  then supply of enbrel could be adversely affected 
our current plan to increase us and canadian supply of enbrel includes construction of an additional large scale cell culture commercial manufacturing facility adjacent to the current rhode island manufacturing facility 
additionally  we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with genentech  inc genentech to produce enbrel at genentech s manufacturing facility in south san francisco  california 
these manufacturing facilities are subject to fda approval 
under the terms of the agreement  genentech is expected to produce enbrel through  with an extension through by mutual agreement 
however  certain milestones under the manufacturing agreement  including obtaining fda approval for the manufacturing process  have not been met in the pre agreed time frame and there can be no assurance that genentech will be able to obtain the requisite fda approval 
if and when approval is received  enbrel bulk drug produced at the genentech facility is expected to be produced in campaigns similar to those conducted at bi pharma 
consequently  supply from the genentech facility is expected to also be dependent on the timing and number of production runs in addition to the other manufacturing risk discussed above 
in addition  wyeth is constructing a new manufacturing facility in ireland  which is expected to increase the us and canadian supply of enbrel 
if the additional enbrel manufacturing capacity at the rhode island site  or at genentech  or in ireland are not completed on time  or if these manufacturing facilities do not receive fda approval before we encounter supply constraints  our enbrel sales would be restricted  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see limits on supply for enbrel may constrain enbrel sales 
our marketed products face substantial competition and other companies may discover  develop  acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated 
for example  enbrel competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by abbott laboratories knoll  centocor inc johnson johnson  aventis  pfizer  and merck as well as the generic drug methotrexate  and may face competition from other potential therapies being developed 
further  if our currently marketed products are approved for new uses  or if we sell new products  we may face new  additional competition that we do not face today 
for example  in the united states  aranesp competes with an epoetin alfa product marketed by johnson johnson in certain anemia markets and enbrel  if approved  may compete in certain circumstances with psoriasis products marketed by biogen and genentech  among others 
additionally  some of our competitors  including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products 
in the future  we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development  drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products  and off label use of drugs approved for other indications 
our european patents relating to erythropoietin and g csf expire on december  and august   respectively  and we believe that after the expiration of these patents  other companies could develop and market new competitive products to our products in europe  presenting additional competition to our products 
while we do not market erythropoietin in europe as this right belongs to johnson johnson through ka  we do market aranesp in the eu which competes with johnson johnson s and others erythropoietin products 
we believe that the eu is currently in the process of developing regulatory requirements that would affect the development and approval of new competitive products 
until such requirements are finalized  we cannot predict when new competitive products could appear on the market in the eu or to what extent such additional competition would impact future aranesp and neupogen neulasta sales in the eu 
our products may compete against products that have lower prices  superior performance  are easier to administer  or that are otherwise competitive with our products 
our inability to compete effectively could adversely affect product sales 
large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical  research  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing  financial and human resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes 
these resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover  develop  and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market 
business combinations among our competitors may also increase competition and the resources available to our competitors 
certain of our raw materials  medical devices and components are single sourced from third parties  third party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products 
certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
also  certain medical devices and components necessary for fill  finish  and packaging of our products are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
certain of these raw materials  medical devices  and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third party suppliers and  in some cases  such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the fda so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the fda approved that other supplier 
we would be unable to obtain these raw materials  medical devices  or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third party single source suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason  including due to regulatory requirements or action  due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier  or due to labor shortages or disputes 
this  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
also  certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources  including mammalian tissues  bovine serum and human serum albumin  or hsa 
we are investigating alternatives to certain biological sources 
raw materials may be subject to contamination and or recall 
a material shortage  contamination  and or recall could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market 
this too  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our product development efforts may not result in commercial products 
we intend to continue an aggressive research and development program 
successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain  and very few research and development projects produce a commercial product 
product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in early human clinical trials  may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the fda  did not approve our product candidate for an intended use the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate  such as patent rights  and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms  or at all the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process  including brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and megakaryocyte growth and development factor mgdf 
for example  in  we announced the failure of bdnf for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  or lou gehrig s disease  because the product candidate  when administered by injection  did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase trial  even though bdnf had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials 
in addition  in  we discontinued development of mgdf  a novel platelet growth factor  at the phase trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies 
of course  there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product 
we cannot guarantee we will be able to produce commercially successful products 
further  clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians  and others  which may delay  limit  or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate 
also  the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product 
we expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval 
see our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval 
we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products  and changes to or re approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required  any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations 
after any of our products are approved for commercial use  we or regulatory bodies could decide that changes to our product labeling are required 
label changes may be necessary for a number of reasons  including the identification of actual or theoretical safety or efficacy concerns by regulatory agencies or the discovery of significant problems with a similar product that implicates an entire class of products 
any significant concerns raised about the safety or efficacy of our products could also result in the need to reformulate those products  to conduct additional clinical trials  to make changes to our manufacturing processes  or to seek re approval of our manufacturing facilities 
significant concerns about the safety and effectiveness of one of our products could ultimately lead to the revocation of its marketing approval 
the revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could be required even if there is no clearly established connection between the product and the safety or efficacy concerns that have been raised 
the revision of product labeling or the regulatory actions described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations 
our business may be impacted by government investigations or litigation we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings relating to various patent matters  government investigations  and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
matters required to be disclosed by us are set forth in item legal proceedings in our form k for the year ended december  and are updated as required in subsequently filed form qs 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and excessive verdicts can occur 
consequently  it is possible that we could  in the future  incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such amounts are incurred 
the federal government  state governments and private payors are investigating  and many have filed actions against  numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including amgen and immunex  alleging that the reporting of prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in false and overstated average wholesale price awp  which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by medicare beneficiaries  insurers  state medicaid programs  medical plans and other payors to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products 
thirteen of these actions have been brought against us and or immunex  now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
eleven states and puerto rico have pending investigations regarding our drug pricing practices and the us departments of justice and health and human services have requested that immunex produce documents relating to pricing issues 
further certain state government entity plaintiffs in some of these awp cases are also alleging that companies  including ours  are not reporting their best price to the states under the medicaid program 
these cases and investigations are described in item legal proceedings average wholesale price litigation in our form k for the year ended december   and are updated as required in subsequent form qs 
other states and agencies could initiate investigations of our pricing practices 
a decision adverse to our interests on these actions and or investigations could result in substantial economic damages and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such amounts are incurred 
we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims 
product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products 
we may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval 
product liability claims  regardless of their merits  could be costly and divert management s attention  and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products 
our operating results may fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons 
in budgeting our operating expenses  we assume that revenues will continue to grow  however  some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term 
because of this  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be below our expectations or projections 
a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
for example  we may face lower than expected demand for our products inability to provide adequate supply of our products changes in the government s or private payors reimbursement policies for our products changes in wholesaler buying patterns increased competition from new or existing products fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our product pricing strategies of these  we would only have control over changes in our product pricing strategies and  of course  there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period 
we have grown rapidly  and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted 
we have had an aggressive growth plan that has included substantial and increasing investments in research and development  sales and marketing  and facilities 
we plan to continue to grow and our plan has a number of risks  some of which we cannot control 
for example we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control we will need to assimilate a large number of new employees we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and faster growing organization we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control of course  there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks 
our stock price is volatile  which could adversely affect your investment 
our stock price  like that of other biotechnology companies  is highly volatile 
for example  in the fifty two weeks prior to december   the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
our stock price may be affected by a number of factors  such as clinical trial results adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products actual or anticipated product supply constraints product development announcements by us or our competitors regulatory matters announcements in the scientific and research community intellectual property and legal matters changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices broader industry and market trends unrelated to our performance in addition  if our revenues  earnings or other financial results in any period fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations 
the development  manufacturing  distribution  pricing  sales  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
see our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval 
and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices  we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  including withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  or other sanctions or litigation 
our marketing of enbrel will be dependent in part upon wyeth 
under a co promotion agreement  we and wyeth market and sell enbrel in the united states and canada 
a management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of enbrel including strategic planning  the approval of an annual marketing plan  product pricing  and the establishment of a brand team 
the brand team  with equal representation from us and wyeth  will prepare and implement the annual marketing plan  which includes a minimum level of financial and sales personnel commitment from each party  and is responsible for all sales activities 
if wyeth fails to market enbrel effectively or if we and wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively  our sales of enbrel may be adversely affected 
guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products 
government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products 
however  professional societies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care and patient communities 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  dosage  route of administration  and use of related therapies 
organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products 
recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products 
in addition  the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income earned on the company s fixed income investment portfolio is impacted by fluctuations in us interest rates upon reinvestment of funds received on maturity or sale of securities at the then current market rates 
in  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements  which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges  to protect against possible reductions in value on certain of its available for sale investment portfolio 
in  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements  which also qualify and are designated as fair value hedges  to protect against possible increase in value of the notes and the century notes 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s notes  century notes and convertible notes because they bear interest at fixed rates 
the following tables provide information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the company s investment portfolio and debt obligations  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the company has assumed its available for sale debt securities  comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities  are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
for the interest rate swaps  the tables present the notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity date 
for the interest rate swaps  variable rates are the average forward rates for the term of each contract 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract

the amount above represents the accreted value on march  the accreted value based on the year contractual maturity is billion 
in the event the company is required to repurchase the notes  it may choose to pay the purchase price in cash and or shares of common stock 
the company is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in its portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
at december  and  the company had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of its equity investment portfolio 
the company did not have material equity price risk on the unhedged portion of its equity investment portfolio at december  and the company did not have material exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to its foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  and
