item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction and overview yum brands  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as yum or the company comprises the worldwide operations of kfc  pizza hut  taco bell  long john silver s ljs and a w all american food restaurants a w collectively the concepts and is the world s largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on the number of system units 
ljs and a w were added when yum acquired yorkshire global restaurants  inc ygr on may  with  international units  yum is the second largest qsr company outside the us yum became an independent  publicly owned company on october  the spin off date via a tax free distribution of our common stock the distribution or spin off to the shareholders of our former parent  pepsico  inc pepsico 
through its concepts  yum develops  operates  franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and non traditional qsr restaurants 
traditional units feature dine in  carryout and  in some instances  drive thru or delivery services 
non traditional units  which are typically licensed outlets  include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non traditional locations like malls  airports  gasoline service stations  convenience stores  stadiums  amusement parks and colleges  where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 
the retail food industry  in which the company competes  is made up of supermarkets  supercenters  warehouse stores  convenience stores  coffee shops  snack bars  delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment  and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality  price  service  convenience  location and concept 
the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local economic conditions  currency fluctuations  demographic trends  traffic patterns  the type  number and location of competing food retailers and products  and disposable purchasing power 
each of the concepts compete with international  national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally owned restaurants  not only for customers  but also for management and hourly personnel  suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 
the company is focused on five long term measures identified as essential to our growth and progress 
these five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows international expansion international system sales growth local currency number of new international restaurant openings net international unit growth multibrand innovation and expansion number of multibrand restaurant locations number of multibrand units added number of franchise multibrand units added portfolio of category leading us brands us blended same store sales growth us system sales growth global franchise fees new restaurant openings by franchisees franchise fee growth strong cash generation and returns cash generated from all sources cash generated from all sources after capital spending restaurant margins our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis md a

factors affecting comparability of results to results and results to results ygr acquisition on may   the company completed its acquisition of ygr  the parent company of ljs and a w 
see note for a discussion of the acquisition 
as of the date of the acquisition  ygr consisted of and company and franchise ljs units  respectively  and and company and franchise a w units  respectively 
in addition  multibranded ljs a w restaurants were included in the ljs unit totals 
except as discussed in certain sections of the md a  the impact of the acquisition on our results of operations in and was not significant relative to the comparable prior year period 
amendment of sale leaseback agreements as discussed in note  on august  we amended two sale leaseback agreements assumed in our acquisition of ygr such that the agreements now qualify for sale leaseback accounting 
there was no gain or loss recorded as a result of this transaction  however  restaurant margins decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment 
the decrease in restaurant margin was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense 
wrench litigation we recorded expense of million in see note for a discussion of the wrench litigation 
ameriserve and other charges credits we recorded income of million in  million in and million in see note for a detailed discussion of ameriserve and other charges credits 
store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets 
such refranchisings reduce our reported company sales and restaurant profits while increasing our franchise fees 
proceeds from refranchising increase the level of cash available to fund discretionary spending 
the following table summarizes our refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising net gains  pre tax a a includes charges of approximately million to write down the carrying value of our puerto rican business to reflect the then current estimates of its fair value 
the charges were recorded as a refranchising loss 
includes million of previously deferred refranchising gains and a charge of million to mark to market the net assets of our singapore business  which was sold during at a price approximately equal to its carrying value 
in addition to our refranchising program  from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing  we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit collectively store closures 
the following table summarizes company store closure activities number of units closed store closure costs impairment charges for stores to be closed the impact on operating profit arising from our refranchising and company store closures is the net of a the estimated reduction in restaurant profit  which reflects the decrease in company sales  and general and administrative expenses and b the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised 
the amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year 
the amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we open in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit

worldwide system sales growth system sales growth worldwide system sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership  including company owned  franchise  unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants

franchise  unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income  however  the fees are included in the company s revenues

the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our average debt outstanding 
interest expense increased million or in excluding the impact of the ygr acquisition  interest expense decreased 
the decrease was driven by a reduction in our average debt balance partially offset by an increase in our average interest rate 
our average interest rate increased due to a reduction in our variable rate borrowings using proceeds from the issuance of longer term  fixed rate notes 
worldwide income taxes reported income taxes effective tax rate the reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the us federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below us federal statutory tax rate state income tax  net of federal tax benefit foreign and us tax effects attributable to foreign operations adjustments to reserves and prior years foreign tax credit amended return benefit valuation allowance additions reversals other  net effective tax rate income taxes and the effective tax rate as shown above reflect tax on all amounts included in our results of operations except for the income tax benefit of approximately million on the million cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the year ended december  due to the adoption of sfas the effective tax rate decreased percentage points to 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a percentage point benefit of amending certain prior us income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years 
the returns were amended upon our determination that it was more beneficial to claim credit for such taxes than to deduct such taxes  as had been done when the returns were originally filed 
in future years  we anticipate continuing to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in the then current year  as we have done in and however  the amended return benefit recognized in is non recurring 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not 
the valuation allowances recognized primarily related to deferred tax assets in mexico and thailand 
see note for a discussion of valuation allowances 
the effective tax rate decreased percentage points to 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to our claiming credit against our current and future us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid in  as opposed to deducting such taxes on our us income tax returns as was done in this decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping valuation allowance reversals recorded in in and  the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of claiming credit against our current and future us income tax liability for foreign taxes paid 
adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our consolidated statements of income to amounts reflected on our tax returns  including any adjustments to the consolidated balance sheets 
adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that we believe may impact our exposure

the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million was primarily the result of the write off of receivables previously fully reserved 
liabilities decreased million or to billion primarily due to the repayment of amounts under our credit facility  decreased short term borrowings and the reduction in long term debt as a result of the amendment of certain sale leaseback agreements see note 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily due to the accrual of million related to the wrench litigation 
liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations  which require a limited yum investment 
in each of the last two fiscal years  net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion 
these cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending  while at the same time reducing our long term debt balances 
we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and repurchases of shares of our common stock 
though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations  we believe our operating cash flows  our ability to reduce discretionary spending  and our borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash requirements in and beyond 
our primary bank credit agreement comprises a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures on june  on december   we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the credit facility from billion to billion 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  our credit facility contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  level of cash dividends  aggregate non us investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december   and do not anticipate that the covenants will impact our ability to borrow under our credit facility for its remaining term 
the remainder of our long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  the first of these notes  in the amount of million  matures in we currently anticipate that our net cash provided by operating activities will permit us to make a significant portion of this million payment without borrowing additional amounts 
we estimate that capital spending will be approximately million and refranchising proceeds will be approximately million in in november  our board of directors authorized a new million share repurchase program 
at december   we had remaining capacity to repurchase  through may   up to million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under this program 
in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt a   capital leases b operating leases b   purchase obligations c other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under gaap total contractual obligations    a excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to approximately  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as marketing  information technology  maintenance  consulting and other agreements 
we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table 
our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan s funded status 
the pension plan s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets 
we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in  but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plan s expected september  funded status 
during  we made voluntary pension contributions of million to our funded plan  none of which represented minimum funding requirements 
our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made postretirement benefit payments of million in also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for employee health and property and casualty losses for which we are self insured 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had provided approximately million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools  both of which were implemented prior to spin off  related primarily to the company s historical refranchising programs and  to a lesser extent  franchisee development of new restaurants 
the total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately million at december  in support of these guarantees  we have posted million of letters of credit 
we also provide a standby letter of credit of million under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools 
any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral 
we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities 
these provisions were primarily charged to facility actions 
new loans are not currently being added to either loan pool 
we have guaranteed certain lines of credit and loans of unconsolidated affiliates totaling million at december  our unconsolidated affiliates had total revenues of over billion for the year ended december  and assets and debt of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  other significant known events  trends or uncertainties expected to impact operating profit comparisons with new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note canada unconsolidated affiliate dissolution on november  our unconsolidated affiliate that previously operated kfc  pizza hut and taco bell restaurants in canada was dissolved 
we owned of this unconsolidated affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method 
upon dissolution  the company assumed operation and acquired all associated assets of the pizza huts  as well as taco bells and kfcs 
the company also acquired the real estate associated with kfcs for which the company will not be the operator 
our former partner in the unconsolidated affiliate acquired full ownership of all other assets  as well as the franchise rights to operate kfcs and one taco bell 
our former partner retained kfcs and sold the remainder of these assets and franchise rights acquired to a newly formed  publicly held income trust in canada  of which our former partner now holds a minority interest 
the company leases land and buildings for kfcs it does not operate to the income trust under operating and capital lease agreements through the company will continue to receive a franchise royalty from the kfcs operated by our former partner and the income trust 
the company realized an immaterial gain upon dissolution of the unconsolidated affiliate 
this gain was realized as the fair value of our increased ownership in the assets received was greater than our carrying value in those assets  and was net of expenses associated with the dissolution of the unconsolidated affiliate 
the impact of the restructuring on our results of operations was not significant 
as a result of the restructuring  company sales are expected to increase by approximately million and franchise fees are expected to decrease by approximately million 
the impact on net income is not expected to be material 
amendment of sale leaseback agreements as discussed in note and on page of this md a  in we amended two sale leaseback agreements assumed in our acquisition of ygr 
we estimate the impact of these amendments in to be a decrease in restaurant profit of million and a decrease in interest expense of million 
puerto rico business held for sale our puerto rican business has been held for sale since the fourth quarter of while a sale of the puerto rican business has not yet occurred  we continue to believe that it is probable that a sale will occur during sales and restaurant profits of the puerto rican business were million and million in contingent lease guarantees under terms of our separation agreements at the time of the spin off  we indemnified pepsico for any losses incurred related to their guarantees of lease agreements of certain non core businesses which were sold prior to the spin off 
two of these businesses  chevys mexican restaurant chevys and hot n now hnn filed for bankruptcy protection in october and january  respectively 
while we cannot presently determine our liability under these indemnities  if any  we do not expect the amount to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
any costs incurred will be charged to ameriserve and other charges credits 
see note for further discussion 
pension plan funded status certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans was amended in such that employees hired after september  are no longer eligible to participate 
as of our september  measurement date  these plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of million  an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million and a fair value of plan assets of million 
as a result of the million underfunded status of the plans relative to the abo at september   we have recorded a million charge to shareholders equity net of tax of million as of december  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at september  a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately million at september  conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately million at september  our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 
we believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
given no change to the market related value of our plan assets as of september   a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase  respectively  our pension plan expense by approximately million 
the losses our plan assets have experienced  along with the decrease in discount rates  have largely contributed to the unrecognized actuarial loss of million in our plans as of september  for purposes of determining expense our funded status was such that we recognized million of unrecognized actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial loss in given no change to the assumptions at our september  measurement date  actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 
in total  we expect pension expense to increase approximately million to million in we have incorporated this incremental expense into our operating plans and outlook 
the increase is driven by the recognition of actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph and an increase in interest cost because of the higher pbo 
service cost will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate  though  as previously mentioned  the plans are closed to new participants 
a basis point change in our discount rate assumption of at september  would impact our pension expense by approximately million 
we do not believe that the underfunded status of the pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in or future years 
given current funding levels and discount rates we would anticipate making contributions to fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five years 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities of approximately billion per year are sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the plans  and anticipated fundings have been incorporated into our cash flow projections 
we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our operating plans and outlook 
avian flu in several asian markets  including thailand  taiwan  south korea  japan  indonesia  malaysia  singapore and certain sections of china  avian flu has impacted retail sales trends and sales trends at kfc through the date of this form k 
based on information as of the date of this form k  the company believes that the most likely effect of avian flu outbreaks in these markets  some of which are completely franchised markets  will be short term 
additionally  the company currently does not expect that the avian flu outbreak will materially affect its chicken supply in asia or other markets 
our most significant market that has been affected by the avian flu is china 
as we have previously stated  if the avian flu outbreak were to affect the entire country of china for up to two months through the end of march  with sales declines in the range of at kfc  diluted eps results for the company would be unfavorably impacted by up to 
we have incorporated this potential unfavorable impact in our operating plans and outlook 
ameriserve and other charges credits during  we expect to recover approximately million related to recoveries from the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 
we expect that this will substantially complete our recoveries related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process 
see note for a detailed discussion of ameriserve and other charges credits 
critical accounting policies our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgements could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level 
restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant 
our semi annual test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
these impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant  which can be for a period of over years  and any terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant on a held and used basis are not recoverable based upon forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows  including terminal value  of the restaurant at an appropriate rate 
the discount rate used is our cost of capital  adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist 
when it is probable that we will sell a restaurant  we write down the restaurant to its fair value 
we often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform impairment evaluations at the group level 
fair value is based on the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs 
estimated sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers  and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary 
in addition  we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants 
the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates is generally significantly in excess of their carrying value 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting units over twenty years plus an expected terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit 
for  there was no impairment of goodwill identified during our annual impairment testing 
for our reporting units with goodwill  the fair value is generally significantly in excess of the recorded carrying value 
thus  we do not believe that we have material goodwill that is at risk to be impaired given current business performance 
for  we impaired million of goodwill related to the pizza hut france reporting unit 
our impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of values assigned to trademarks brands of which we have acquired ownership or the right to a perpetual royalty free license in the case of a w 
we believe the value of these trademarks brands is derived from the royalty we avoid  in the case of company stores  or receive  in the case of franchise stores  due to our ownership of or royalty free license of the trademarks brands 
thus  anticipated sales are the most important assumption in valuing trademarks brands 
we limit assumptions about sales growth  as well as other factors impacting the fair value calculation  to those that are supportable based on our plans for the applicable concept 
the most significant recorded trademark brand assets resulted when we acquired ygr in upon this acquisition  million and million were allocated to the ljs and a w trademarks brands  respectively 
the results generated to date from the ygr acquisition on an overall basis have met our expectations 
we also now believe opportunities exist beyond those assumed in justification of our acquisition price with regard to increased penetration of ljs  for both stand alone units and as a multibrand partner 
accordingly  we now believe our system s development capital  at least through the term of our current projections  will be primarily directed towards ljs 
the decision to focus short term development on increased penetration of ljs and discretionary capital spending limits have resulted in less than originally planned development of a w in the near term 
additionally  while we continue to view a w as a viable multibrand partner  subsequent to acquisition we decided to close or refranchise all company owned a w restaurants that we had acquired 
these restaurants were low volume  mall based units  that were inconsistent with the remainder of our company owned portfolio 
we incorporated these plans into our fair value estimates of the ljs and a w trademarks brands in as sales projections for ljs were in excess of those originally assumed when valuing the ljs trademark brand  the trademark brand s current fair value is in excess of its carrying value 
both the decision to close the company owned a w units and the decision to focus on short term development opportunities at ljs negatively impacted the fair value of the a w trademark brand 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million in to write the value of a w trademark brand down to its fair value 
while we believe the sales assumptions used in our determination of the fair value of the a w trademark brand are reasonable and consistent with our operating plans and forecasts  fluctuations in the assumptions would have impacted our impairment calculation 
if the long term rate of sales growth used in our determination of the fair value of the a w trademark brand would have been one percentage point higher  the trademark brand would not have been impaired 
alternatively  if the long term rate of sales growth would have been one percentage point lower  additional impairment of approximately million would have been recognized

allowances for franchise and license receivables and contingent liabilities we reserve a franchisee s or licensee s entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
as a result of reserving using this methodology  we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december  see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
primarily as a result of our refranchising efforts  we remain liable for certain lease assignments and guarantees 
we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees when such exposure is probable and estimable 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable 
the potential total exposure under such leases is significant  with million representing the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december   discounted at our pre tax cost of debt 
current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and  historically  we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 
see note for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty claims 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves at december   we have a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in annual income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk international operating profit constitutes approximately of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated and corporate expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  the americas and europe 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical and holding cash in local currencies when possible 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as  on a limited basis  commodity future and option contracts 
commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december   and december   did not significantly impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cautionary statements from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements  we present forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the statements include those identified by such words as may  will  expect  project  anticipate  believe  plan and other similar terminology 
these forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements 
actual results involve risks and uncertainties  including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry  and could differ materially from expectations 
company risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  potentially substantial tax contingencies related to the spin off  which  if they occur  require us to indemnify pepsico  inc  changes in effective tax rates  our debt leverage and the attendant potential restriction on our ability to borrow in the future  potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities  our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores  effects and outcomes of legal claims involving the company  the effectiveness of operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts  the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees  the success of our refranchising strategy  volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates  and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies 
industry risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  economic and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate  including effects of war and terrorist activities  changes in legislation and governmental regulation  new product and concept development by us and or our food industry competitors  changes in commodity  labor  and other operating costs  changes in competition in the food industry  publicity which may impact our business and or industry  severe weather conditions  volatility of commodity costs  increases in minimum wage and other operating costs  availability and cost of land and construction  consumer preferences  spending patterns and demographic trends  political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates  the impact that any widespread illness or general health concern may have on our business and or the economy of the countries in which we operate
