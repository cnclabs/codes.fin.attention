tied with one or more stations in the market 

table of contents the company depends on advertising as its principal source of revenues  including the sale of air time on its television stations and advertising space in published issues of its newspapers and on the company s web sites 
as a result  the company s operations are sensitive to changes in the economy  particularly in the dallas fort worth metropolitan area  where its two largest properties are located 
the company also derives revenues  to a much lesser extent  from the sale of daily newspapers  from compensation paid by networks to its television stations for broadcasting network programming and from subscription and data retrieval fees and amounts charged to customers for commercial printing jobs 
during and  the company s performance  and the performance of the television and newspaper industries as a whole  were negatively impacted by the economic downturn and reduced advertising expenditures 
while the economic environment remains challenging  television group and newspaper group advertising revenues  excluding television political advertising revenues  showed signs of improvement in the second half of total net revenues in were modestly higher than revenues as a result of increases in newspaper group and interactive media revenues  partially offset by a decrease in television group revenues 
the company intends the discussion of its financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding the company s financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect the company s financial statements

gaap and non gaap financial measures in this report  financial measures are presented in accordance with gaap and also on a non gaap basis 
gaap refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
all references in this report to ebitda and operating costs and expenses before depreciation and amortization are non gaap financial measures 
management believes that the use of these non gaap financial measures enables management and investors to evaluate  and compare from period to period  the company s results from ongoing operations in a meaningful and consistent manner 
ebitda is used in the broadcasting and publishing industries to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and liquidity 
ebitda and operating costs and expenses before depreciation and amortization should not be used as measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net earnings  earnings from operations  cash flows generated by operating  investing or financing activities or financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements 
because ebitda and operating costs and expenses before depreciation and amortization are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda and operating costs and expenses before depreciation and amortization as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates belo s financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical accounting policies currently affecting belo s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition broadcast revenue is recorded  net of agency commissions  when commercials are aired 
newspaper advertising revenue is recorded  net of agency commissions  when the advertisements are published in the newspaper 
proceeds from subscriptions are deferred and are included in revenue on a pro rata basis over the term of the subscriptions 
bad debt belo maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of belo s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
at december   belo had investments of  in net property  plant and equipment   in goodwill and  in other intangible assets  primarily fcc licenses 
during the year ended december   the company did not record any impairment losses related to property  plant and equipment  goodwill or other intangible assets 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
contingencies belo is involved in certain claims and litigation related to its operations 
in the opinion of management  liabilities  if any  arising from these claims and litigation would not have a material adverse effect on belo s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
employee benefits belo is effectively self insured for employee related health care benefits 
a third party administrator is used to process all claims 
belo s employee health insurance liability is based on the company s historical claims experience rate and is developed from actuarial valuations 
belo s reserves associated with the exposure to the self insured liabilities are monitored by management for adequacy 
however  actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates  which would require the company to record additional expenses 
pension benefits belo s pension costs and obligations are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the company uses assumptions including  but not limited to  the selection of the discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets  projected salary increases and mortality rates 
the discount rate assumption is based on a review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in these rates during the year 
the assumptions regarding the long term rate of return on plan assets and projected salary increases are based on an evaluation of the company s historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension reporting are reviewed periodically and compared with external benchmarks so that they accurately account for the company s future pension obligations 
although the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences between assumed and actual experience may affect the company s operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s pension plan
