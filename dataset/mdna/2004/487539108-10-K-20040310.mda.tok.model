item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
overview revenue we derive most of our revenue from professional service activities 
the majority of these activities are billed under various types of contracts with our clients  including fixed price and time and materials contracts 
most of our time and material contracts have not to exceed provisions 
for contracts with either a fixed price or a not to exceed provision  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the proportion of actual direct contract costs incurred to total estimated direct contract costs 
we believe that costs incurred are the best available measure of progress towards completion on these contracts 
in the course of providing services  we sometimes subcontract for various services 
these costs are included in billings to clients and are included in our gross revenue 
because subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  changes in gross revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
accordingly  we also report net revenue  which is gross revenue less reimbursable subcontractor costs 
our revenue is generated from a large number of relatively small contracts 
costs of revenue costs of revenue include labor  non reimbursable costs  materials and various direct and indirect overhead costs including rent  utilities and depreciation 
direct labor employees work predominantly at our offices and at the clients job sites 
the number of direct labor employees assigned to a contract will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
contract terminations  completions  scheduling delays and contract proposal activity may result in periods when direct labor employees are not fully utilized 
as we continue to grow  we anticipate that we will continue to add professional and administrative staff to support our growth 
these professionals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
the significant competition for employees with the skills we require creates wage pressures on professional compensation 
we attempt to increase our billing rates to customers to compensate for wage increases  however  there can be a lag before wage increases can be incorporated into our existing contracts 
some expenses  primarily long term leases  are fixed and cannot be adjusted in reaction to an economic downturn 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of corporate costs related to finance and accounting  information technology  business development and marketing  contract proposals  executive salaries  provisions for doubtful accounts and other indirect overhead costs 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  are considered to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainties inherent in making assumptions and estimates regarding unknown future outcomes  future events may result in significant differences between estimates and actual results 
we believe that each of the assumptions and estimates are appropriate in the circumstances  and represent the most likely future outcome 
the following is what we believe are the critical accounting policies most affected by management estimates and judgements 

table of contents revenue and cost recognition estimates on contracts 
we use estimates in recognizing revenue related to our contracts with fixed price or not to exceed provisions 
for these contracts  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the proportion of actual direct contract costs incurred to total estimated direct contract costs 
we believe that costs incurred are the best available measure of progress towards completion on these contracts 
estimating the total estimated direct contract cost is a subjective process and requires the use of our best estimates based upon the current information known by us at that point in time 
our estimate of total direct contract cost has a direct impact on the revenue recognized by us 
if our current estimate of total direct contract costs turns out to be higher than our previous estimates of total direct contract cost  then we would have over recognized revenue for that previous period 
conversely  if our current estimates of total direct contract costs turns out to be lower than our previous estimates of total direct contract costs  we would have under recognized revenue for that previous period 
in both cases  a job to date adjustment would be made to true up revenue as a change in estimate applied prospectively 
goodwill 
we use estimates in order to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we arrive at the estimated fair value of a reporting unit by using a variety of customary valuation methods  such as discounted cash flow analysis and multiples of net revenue and earnings before interest and taxes 
these valuation methods use a variety of assumptions such as future billable employee headcount  net revenue per billable employee  operating income  cash flow  discount rates and multiples 
estimating fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process and requires the use of our best estimates 
we will perform our valuation analysis at least annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
if our estimates or assumptions change from those used in our current valuation  we may be required to recognize an impairment loss in future periods 
provision for doubtful accounts 
we use estimates in arriving at our allowance for doubtful accounts related to our contracts and trade receivables 
these estimates are based on our best assessment as to the collectibility of the related receivable balance 
each quarter  we re evaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts as necessary 
factors considered in arriving at our allowance for doubtful accounts  include among other things  historical and anticipated client default rates at the various aging categories of contract and trade receivables and the overall business environment economy 
future collections of receivables that are different from our current estimates will affect results of operations in future periods 
discretionary bonus plan 
during  we implemented a discretionary bonus plan 
under this bonus plan  we may award an annual cash performance bonus to our employees provided that our annual actual results exceed a pre established annual target 
we review the need for a bonus accrual on a quarterly basis by comparing our actual quarterly results and our estimated results for the remainder of the year to our annual pre established target 
estimating our future results is a subjective process and requires the use of our best estimates based upon the current information known to us at that point in time 
as a result of potential changes to our estimates  our quarterly results may be significantly affected by adjustments to the bonus accrual 
in the fourth quarter of  we made our final adjustment to the bonus accrual 
any annual bonus award under this plan is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors 
impact of our industry diversification strategy to help reduce our susceptibility to economic cycles affecting the real estate development industry  we intend to expand our work in the public works infrastructure and the energy industrial industries as feasible  based upon such items as economic and market conditions 
we believe that among other business initiatives  our acquisition strategy may play a significant role in contributing to this objective 
the acquisitions of pacific engineering corporation pec and universal energy inc uei during  alnm group  inc alnm in and anticipated future acquisitions  many of which may include engineering services outside of the real estate development industry  may have a significant impact on our future net revenue mix 
due to these and potential future acquisitions  we anticipate that our margins may be affected by the decreased business concentration from the real estate development industry which has historically yielded higher margins than services provided to the public works infrastructure and energy industrial industries 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth supplemental consolidated operating results for each of the periods presented as a percentage of net revenue years ended december  gross revenue subcontractor costs net revenue costs of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income interest expense income  net other income expenses  net income before provision for income taxes and discontinued operations provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income the following table sets forth the company s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and and includes the dollar and percentage change years ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross revenue subcontractor costs net revenue costs of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income interest expense income  net other income expenses  net income before provision for income taxes and discontinued operations provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income 
table of contents years ended december  and december  net revenue 
net revenue for decreased million  or  to million compared to million for this decrease in net revenue was partially offset by million in additional net revenue during related to the acquisition of alnm group  inc alnm  in march  as compared to the same period in excluding the net revenue from the alnm acquisition  net revenue decreased by million  or 
this decrease was primarily a result of a continued slowdown in our energy industrial industry segment due to a slowdown in the pace of construction of new power plants and or alternative power solutions and a general decrease in capital spending in the energy industrial industry  coupled with the completion of a large contract in our energy industrial segment which had significant activity during  and lower net revenue from our arizona office  which was part of the acquisition of hook associates engineering  inc hook in january the decline in net revenue was partially offset by increased net revenue generated from our real estate services due to a strong california residential real estate market 
subcontractor costs  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to during as compared to during the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in subcontractor costs related to several large contracts in in our energy industrial segment 
market uncertainties in the power generation portion of the energy industry have caused a decline in the pace of construction of new power plants and or alternative power solutions and a general decrease in capital spending in the energy industrial industry 
as a result  our energy industrial segment continued to experience a reduction in net revenue during if this market uncertainty continues  it may cause further reductions in net revenue and therefore continue to negatively impact net income from our energy industrial segment 
although we have not experienced a significant decrease in net revenue from our public works infrastructure industry during as compared to  certain current conditions  including a weak economy in the public works infrastructure industry  especially in the greater southeast michigan area  lead us to believe that we may experience an adverse impact to net revenue and net income related to this industry 
gross profit 
gross profit for remained flat at million compared to excluding the additional gross profit of million generated from the acquisition of alnm in march  gross profit decreased by million 
this decrease was mainly due to lower gross profit from our energy industrial segment  along with the completion of a large contract in our energy industrial segment which had significant activity during  and million of additional expense related to the discretionary bonus plan 
these decreases were offset by strong gross profit from our real estate services 
for  gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to as compared to during this increase was primarily due to strong gross profit from our real estate services  which was partially offset by lower gross profit from our energy industrial segment 
as noted above  due to a continuing decline in the pace of construction of new power plants and or alternative power solutions and a general decrease in capital spending in the energy industrial industry  our energy industrial segment experienced a reduction in its gross profit during if this decline continues  it may cause our energy industrial segment to experience a continued reduction of gross profit and therefore also a reduction in net income 
we have experienced a slight decrease in gross profit from our public works infrastructure industry during as compared to certain current conditions  including a weak economy in the public works infrastructure industry  especially in the greater southeast michigan area  lead us to believe we may experience a further decline in our gross profit and net income related to this industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
during  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  to million compared to during the increase in sg a during was primarily due to the increase in sg a costs attributable to alnm  and increases in legal fees  proposal activities  employee placement fees for new hires  and the provision for doubtful accounts 
during  sg a as a percentage of net revenue increased to compared to during primarily due to increases in the items discussed above 

table of contents interest income 
interest income during decreased by  as compared to this decrease in interest income resulted from lower yields earned on cash and securities  partially offset by an increase in the average balance of cash and securities as compared to interest expense 
interest expense during increased by  compared to the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a  reduction of interest expense during associated with an acquisition modification agreement related to hook which resulted in the cancellation of a million acquisition note payable 
other income expenses  net 
other income during decreased by  as compared to this decrease was primarily associated with a  increase in other income during resulting from purchase price adjustments in connection with the acquisitions of crosby mead benton associates cmb and hook 
this decrease was partially offset by a net  sublease termination fee recognized by us during related to one of our facilities which we had subleased and  in other income recognized during associated with a purchase price adjustment related to the acquisition of alnm 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes during was million compared to million for this decrease in provision for income taxes during resulted from a lower taxable base 
our effective tax rate was during and discontinued operations 
we closed down the operations of three divisions during two of these divisions were part of our operations in colorado and wyoming from our acquisition of hook  and the third was our internally created communication division located in california 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the activities of these divisions were segregated and reported as discontinued operations during the following table sets forth the company s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and and includes the dollar and percentage change years ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross revenue subcontractor costs net revenue costs of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income interest income expense  net other income expenses  net income before provision for income taxes and discontinued operations provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income 
table of contents years ended december  and december  net revenue 
the growth in net revenue for compared to is primarily attributable to acquisitions  which contributed million in net revenue 
the acquired companies mainly contributing to this net revenue growth include pec  uei  and alnm  whose operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since october  december and march  respectively 
excluding the net revenue from these acquisitions  net revenue increased by million  or  compared to the increase in net revenue  excluding acquisitions  primarily resulted from i a strong southern california residential real estate market  which continued to experience an increase in demand  and ii higher net revenue derived from the company s water resource services 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net revenue generated by the company s arizona office which is part of the hook operations coupled with lower net revenue generated from the company s orange county office resulting mainly from a continued weak commercial and industrial real estate market 
subcontractor costs  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to during compared to during  resulting largely from an increase in subcontractor costs related to several large contracts in the energy industrial industry 
difficulties in the power generation segment of the energy industry have caused a decline in the pace of construction of new power plants and or alternative power solutions 
as a result  our energy industrial industry began to experience a reduction in net revenue during the fourth quarter of if the difficulties continue  they may cause further reductions in net revenue and therefore net income in our energy industrial industry 
gross profit 
the increase in gross profit was mainly attributable to acquisitions  which added gross profit of million during compared to the prior year 
excluding the gross profit from acquisitions  gross profit increased million or during as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to strong gross profit resulting from continued demand for residential real estate in southern california and higher gross profit generated from the company s water resource services  all of which were partially offset by lower gross profit from i the hook arizona office  ii one of our northern california offices  and iii our uei division  as mentioned above 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit decreased to during from during the percentage decrease was primarily related to lower margins related to the company s energy industrial industry  the hook arizona office  and alnm which mainly provides services in the public works infrastructure industry 
the increase in the costs of revenue was primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with the growth in our total direct employee base  which grew from an average of in to in this increase is primarily a result of acquisitions 
as noted above  due to a continuing decline in the pace of construction of new power plants  and or alternative power solutions  our energy industrial industry experienced a reduction in its gross profit in the fourth quarter of if this decline continues  it may cause our energy industrial industry to experience a continued reduction of gross profits and therefore also a reduction in net income 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to acquisitions  an increase in corporate administrative costs  and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts  all of which were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization  as compared to acquired companies contributed million of additional selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to during from during  mainly from the elimination of goodwill amortization which was partially offset by the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
interest income 
the decrease in interest income resulted from lower yields on cash and securities  partially offset by an increase in the average balance of cash and securities as compared to 
table of contents interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction of interest expense associated with the acquisition modification agreement as discussed under the liquidity and capital resources section related to hook  which resulted in the cancellation of a million acquisition note payable and the overall reduction of debt as compared to other income expenses  net 
the increase in other income was primarily associated with  resulting from a purchase price adjustment in connection with the acquisitions of cmb and hook 
income taxes 
the increase in provision for income taxes resulted primarily from higher pre tax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate during our effective income tax rate was approximately during compared to during discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations is attributable to the closure of three of our divisions during two of these divisions related to our hook operations located in colorado and wyoming  and  the third was our internally created communication division which was located in california 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the activities of these divisions have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations during and the increase in the loss from discontinued operations was mainly due to continuing difficult market conditions and deteriorating operating results in colorado 
related party in march  we entered into change in control agreements with aram h 
keith  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  eric c 
nielsen  our president and chief operating officer  and gary c 
campanaro  our chief financial officer and secretary  and a director of our company 
these agreements provide that if the executive officer s employment with us terminates as a result of an involuntary or constructive termination as these terms are defined in the agreements at any time within two years following a change in control  then  in addition to other benefits  the executive officer will receive a one time payment  equal to two times the executive officer s highest annual level of total cash compensation including any and all bonus amounts paid by us to that executive officer during any one of the three consecutive calendar years inclusive of the year of termination immediately prior to termination 
the executive officer also is entitled to receive a payment by us to offset any excise tax under the internal revenue code of  as amended  that has been levied against the executive officer for payments that we have made to him 
in addition  any unvested options previously granted to the executive officer will immediately vest and become exercisable as of the date of termination and remain exercisable until their respective expiration dates 
we have not entered into any material related party transactions during liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents combined with securities held to maturity totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
working capital as of december  was million compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
our debt to equity ratio excluding the effect of issuable common stock at both december  and december  was to cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  to million during compared to million during the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during as compared to was primarily the result of lower net income  partially offset by a purchase price adjustment and changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of effects from acquisitions 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for compared to million for  an increase of million 
this increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a significant increase in cash used to purchase securities held to maturity  substantially offset by a decrease in cash used for acquisitions 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by  to  for compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for this increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from a decrease of principal payments on our debt and capital lease obligations during the company has available a million unsecured line of credit consisting of four components i an acquisition component  ii an equipment and vehicle financing component  iii a standby letter of credit component  and iv a working capital component 
the line provides up to a maximum of million to finance acquisitions  up to a maximum of million to finance equipment and vehicle purchases  up to a maximum of million for standby letters of credit  and up to a maximum of million less the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the acquisition  equipment and vehicle  and standby letter of credit components for working capital 
the line bears interest at either a range of below prime to prime  or a range of to over libor depending on the company s ability to meet certain financial covenants 
all components of the line of credit mature in june this line of credit agreement restricts the payment of dividends without the bank s consent 
as of december   the company had utilized the letter of credit component of this line of credit to issue a  stand by letter of credit 
the company did not have any outstanding balances under this line of credit agreement as of december  our financial statements for reflect the reduction of the purchase price of alnm which we acquired in march under the terms of the purchase agreement  the obligation to issue million in shares of our common stock was reduced to approximately million 
on occasion  we will enter into purchase agreements related to acquisitions which provide for future purchase price payments or earn outs as a result of achieving certain operating results by the acquired companies 
as a result of these earn out provisions  we may be obligated to pay additional consideration in future periods 
current accounting principles require that these earn outs be accrued on our balance sheet only at the point at which the earn out period has elapsed and the performance targets have been met 
as of december   we have one year remaining on an earn out and we may be obligated to pay a maximum of million in additional purchase price related to our acquisitions  of which will be paid in cash with the remaining to be paid out in our common stock 
such potential earn outs are not currently reflected on our balance sheet as the earn out period has not elapsed and  therefore  the achievement of the performance target is currently unknown 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
in addition  we presently do not enter into any hedging type activities to manage our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with our brazilian operation 
our brazilian operation  which provides services to our energy industrial segment  generated approximately million in net revenue during furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities  special purpose entities  or variable interest entities 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in the future 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations future cash requirements we expect to fund our future liquidity needs primarily from i operating cash flows  ii existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and securities held to maturity  and iii borrowings under our million unsecured revolving line of credit  which we have not utilized as of december  other than to issue a  stand by letter of credit 
we believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to provide 
table of contents for our operations and planned capital expenditures and satisfy our debt obligations over the next twelve months 
we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal to range between approximately million to million 
we also intend to use available liquidity to continue our acquisition strategy 
we continue to examine acquisitions of complementary businesses and anticipate that our liquidity will be sufficient to provide for potential acquisitions for the next twelve months 
however  the pace and size of acquisitions are difficult to predict 
we may complete more or fewer acquisitions than we currently contemplate depending on the opportunities that present themselves  and our cash requirements may change accordingly 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued on or after may  sfas addresses issues pertaining to costs associated with exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of these standards did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation although our operations can be influenced by general economic trends  we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
due to the short term nature of most of our contracts  if costs of revenue increase  we will attempt to pass these increases on to our clients  however  there can be a lag before these increases in costs can be incorporated into our existing contracts 
the following discussion summarizes material risks which you should carefully consider before you decide to invest in our common stock or to maintain or increase your investment 
any of the following risks  if they actually occur  would likely harm our business 
the trading price of our common stock could then decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
risk factors risks related to our industries our business could suffer if there is a downturn in the real estate market during  approximately of our net revenue was rendered in connection with commercial and residential real estate development projects 
reduced demand in the real estate market would likely decrease the demand for our services 
a decrease in the demand for our services could result in cash flow difficulties and potential operating losses for our company 
the real estate market and  therefore  our business  may be impacted by a number of factors  which may include changes in employment levels and other national and local economic conditions  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of financing  
table of contents the impact of present or future environmental  zoning or other laws and regulations  changes in real estate tax rates and assessments and other operating expenses  changes in levels of government spending and fiscal policies  and earthquakes and other natural or manmade disasters and other factors which are beyond our control 
we derive revenue from contracts with government agencies 
any disruption in government funding or in our relationship with those agencies could adversely affect our business the demand for our services is related to the level of government program funding that is allocated to rebuild  improve and expand the nation s infrastructure 
we believe that the success and further development of our business depends  in part  upon the continued funding of these government programs and upon our ability to participate in these government programs 
we cannot assure you that governments will have the available resources to fund these programs  that these programs will continue to be funded even if governments have available financial resources or that we will continue to win government contracts 
some of these government contracts are subject to renewal or extensions annually  so we cannot be assured of our continued work under these contracts in the future 
unsuccessful bidders may protest or challenge the award of these contracts 
in addition  government agencies can terminate these contracts at their convenience 
as a result  we may incur costs in connection with the termination of these contracts and suffer a loss of business 
also  contracts with government agencies are subject to substantial regulation and an audit of actual costs incurred 
consequently  there may be a downward adjustment to our revenue if billed recoverable costs exceed actual recoverable costs 
we derive revenue from engineering services provided to the energy industry 
continued delay and reduction in the pace of construction for new power plants  cogeneration facilities  and electrical distribution facilities has had  and may continue to have an adverse affect on our business the demand for our services is related to the level and pace of construction of energy related solutions 
we believe that the success and further development of this aspect of our business depends  in part  upon the need for and funding of these projects 
high energy prices  power shortages  and pressure at state and federal levels for increased supply resulted in the increased demand for energy related solutions with an unprecedented number of new power plants  cogeneration facilities  and electrical distribution facilities announced in however  a weakening demand and softening economy combined with a decline in energy prices have caused builders of such energy related solutions to reconsider planned projects 
many have announced downsizings or cancellations of new power plants and or alternative power solutions 
the decline in the pace of construction of new power plants and or alternative power solutions has had  and may continue to have  an adverse affect on our energy industrial segment 
we may have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified professionals  which may harm our reputation in the marketplace and restrict our ability to implement our business strategy we derive our revenue almost exclusively from services performed by our professionals 
we may not be able to attract and retain the desired number of professionals over the short or long term 
there is significant competition for professionals with the skills necessary for the provision of our services from major and boutique consulting  engineering  research and other professional service firms 
we believe that our existing relationships between our clients and our employees is one of our greatest business development assets 
our inability to attract and retain qualified professionals could impede our ability to secure and complete engagements  in which event  we may lose market share and our revenue and profit may decline 
terrorism and related conflicts may have a material adverse effect on our operating results the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september   along with the united states military campaign against terrorism in afghanistan  iraq and elsewhere  and ongoing violence in the middle east have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which had and may materially 
table of contents affect the markets in which we operate  and our operations and profitability 
the short term and long term effects of these developments on our customers  the markets for our services and the us economy are uncertain 
the consequences of any terrorist attacks  or any armed conflicts  are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our markets  or our business 
risk factors risks related to our business our revenue  income and cash flow could decline if there is a downturn in the california economy or real estate market during  approximately of our net revenue was derived from services rendered in california 
poor economic conditions in california may significantly reduce the demand for our services and decrease our revenue and profits 
from to  our business was negatively impacted during the real estate market downturn in southern california  and we experienced cash flow difficulties and substantial operating losses 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  we could incur unforeseen costs or delays and our reputation and reliability in the marketplace could be damaged we have grown rapidly and intend to pursue further growth  through acquisitions and otherwise  as part of our business strategy but we may not be able to manage our growth effectively and efficiently 
our inability to manage our growth effectively and efficiently could cause us to incur unforeseen costs  time delays or other negative impacts  any of which could cause a decline in our revenue and profitability 
our rapid growth has presented and will continue to present numerous administrative and operational challenges  including the management of an expanding array of engineering and consulting services  the assimilation of financial reporting systems  increased pressure on our senior management and increased demand on our systems and internal controls 
if we are unable to successfully implement our acquisition strategy  we may not meet our current expectations of growth and or operating results our growth strategy includes the strategic acquisition of companies that expand our service offerings and geographic presence  including acquisitions that may be larger than our historic acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our acquisition strategy  we could fail to achieve the revenue and profitability growth that we currently expect 
we may not be successful in implementing our acquisition strategy for a number of reasons  including the following we may fail to consummate an acquisition even if an announcement had been made to acquire a target company  as the engineering industry consolidates  suitable acquisition candidates are expected to become more difficult to locate and may only be available at an increased price or under terms that are less favorable than in the past  we may not be able to arrange suitable financing to consummate an acquisition  we may not be successful in integrating an acquired company s professionals  clientele and culture into ours  we may not be successful in generating the same level of operating performance that an acquired company experienced prior to the acquisition  as we expand our service offerings and geographic presence  we may not be able to maintain the current level of quality of services  we may not be able to maintain our reputation in an acquired entity s geographic area or service offerings and as a consequence our ability to attract and retain clients in those or other areas may be negatively impacted  an acquired company may be less profitable than us resulting in reduced profit margins  and 
table of contents the acquisition and subsequent integration of an acquired company may require a significant amount of management s time  diverting their attention from our existing operations and clients  which could result in the loss of key employees or clients 
if our estimates or assumptions used in arriving at the fair value of acquired entities change from those used in our current valuations  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment loss we use estimates in order to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
an impairment loss may be required to be recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we arrive at the estimated fair value of a reporting unit by using a variety of customary valuation methods  such as discounted cash flow analysis and multiples of net revenue and earnings before interest and taxes 
these valuation methods use a variety of assumptions such as future billable employee headcount  net revenue per billable employee  operating income  cash flow  discount rates and multiples 
estimating fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process and requires the use of our best estimates 
if our estimates or assumptions change from those used in our current valuation  we may be required to recognize an impairment loss 
as of december   our goodwill balance  net of accumulated amortization was million 
we no longer amortize goodwill due to our adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we could lose money if we fail to accurately estimate our costs on fixed price contracts and or contracts with not to exceed provisions we expect to perform services under contracts that may limit our profitability 
under fixed price contracts we perform services at a stipulated price 
under time and materials contracts with not to exceed provisions  we are reimbursed for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate plus the cost of materials incurred  subject  however  to a stated maximum dollar amount for the services to be provided under the contract 
in both of these types of contracts  we agree to provide our services based on our estimate of the costs a particular project will involve 
our estimates are not always accurate 
underestimation of costs for these types of contracts may cause us to incur losses or result in a project not being as profitable as we expected 
we may fail to estimate costs accurately for a number of reasons  including weakness in the management of our projects  loss of efficiency resulting from cross utilization of office staff from various locations  changes in the costs of goods and services that may occur during the contract period  problems with new technologies  and delays beyond our control 
our backlog is an uncertain indicator of future financial performance and is subject to adjustment or cancellation our gross revenue backlog for fixed price contracts and time and materials contracts with not to exceed provisions as of december  was approximately million 
we cannot assure you that the entire balance of our backlog will convert into revenue since our contracts are subject to scope adjustments and or cancellations

table of contents if our employees leave our company and join a competitor  we may lose business our employees might leave our company and become competitors of ours 
if this happens  we may lose additional employees and some of our existing clients that have formed relationships with our former employees 
in addition  we may lose future clients to a former employee as a new competitor 
in either event  we could lose clients and revenue  and our profitability could decline 
adverse weather conditions or acts of god may cause a delay or elimination of our net revenue otherwise recognized and adversely affect our profitability field activities are generally performed outdoors and may include surveying  archeology  plant start up and testing  and plant operations 
certain weather conditions or acts of god such as fire  floods  etc 
may cause postponements in the initiation and or completion of our field activities and or may hinder the ability of our office employees to arrive at work  which may result in a delay or elimination of revenue that otherwise would have been recognized  while certain costs will continue to be incurred 
adverse weather conditions or acts of god may also delay or eliminate our initiation and or completion of the various phases of work relating to our other engineering services that commence concurrent with or subsequent to field activities 
any delay in completion of the field  office and or other activities may require us to incur additional costs attributable to overtime work necessary to meet the client s required schedule 
due to various factors  a delay in the commencement or completion of a project may also result in a cancellation of the contract 
as a result  our net revenue and profitability may be adversely affected 
our business may expose us to liability in excess of our current insurance coverage we are exposed to potential liabilities to clients for errors or omissions in the services we perform 
these liabilities could exceed our current insurance coverage and the fees we derive from those services 
we cannot always predict the magnitude of these potential liabilities but claims could be significant 
a partially or completely uninsured claim  if successful and of significant magnitude  could result in substantial losses 
we currently maintain general liability  umbrella  professional liability  directors and officers liability  and various types of other insurance policies 
claims may be made against us which exceed the limits of these policies  in which case we would be liable to pay these claims from our assets 
our professional liability and directors and officers liability policies are claims made policies and only claims made during the term of the policy are covered 
if we terminate our policies and do not obtain retroactive coverage  we would be uninsured for claims made after termination even if these claims are based on events or acts that occurred during the term of the policy 
our insurance policies typically have various exceptions to the claims covered and also require us to assume some costs of the claim even though a portion of the claim may be covered  resulting in potential liability to us 
further  our expansion into new services or geographic areas could result in our failure to obtain coverage for these services or areas  or the coverage being offered may be at a higher cost than our current coverage 
due to the current insurance environment  we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in our insurance premiums 
we may not be able to pass these increases on to our clients in increased billing rates 
if we are unable to engage qualified subcontractors  we may lose projects  revenue and clients we often contract with outside companies to perform designated portions of the services we perform for our clients 
if we are unable to engage subcontractors  our ability to perform under some of our contracts may be impeded and the quality of our service may decline 
as a consequence  we may lose projects  revenue and clients 
subcontractor costs accounted for approximately of our net revenue during we derive revenue from contracts for work performed in foreign countries which are subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect the results from these contracts international business is subject to the customary risks associated with international transactions  including political risks  local law and taxes  difficulty in enforcing contracts  the potential imposition of trade or currency exchange restrictions  tariff increases and difficulties or delays in collecting accounts receivables 

table of contents weak foreign economies and or a weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we presently do not enter into any hedging type activities to manage our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with our brazilian operations 
risk factors risks related to ownership of our stock our stock price may decrease  which could result in significant losses for investors or adversely affect our business the following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease  perhaps substantially the failure of our quarterly operating results to meet expectations  adverse developments in the worldwide economy  the financial markets  the engineering and consulting services market  the real estate market  the public works infrastructure market  and or the energy industrial market  changes in interest rates  our failure to meet securities analysts expectations  changes in accounting principles  sales of common stock by existing shareholders or holders of options  announcements of key developments by our competitors  the reaction of markets and securities analysts to announcements and developments involving our company  and resolution of threatened or pending litigation 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
insiders have substantial control over us  which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions our executive officers and directors  in the aggregate  hold approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these shareholders  if they act together  can have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
if we need to sell or issue additional shares of common stock and or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions  your stock ownership could be diluted and our results of operations could be adversely affected our business strategy is to expand into new markets and enhance our position in existing markets through the acquisitions of complementary businesses 
in order to successfully complete targeted acquisitions or to fund our other activities  we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute your stock ownership 
we may also incur additional debt if we acquire another company  and this could negatively impact our results of operations 

table of contents our board of directors has the ability to discourage takeover attempts  which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell your shares for a premium in a change of control transaction our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide us with the ability to issue blank check preferred stock without consulting our shareholders 
as a result  our board of directors may frustrate a takeover attempt by issuing shares to a friendly shareholder or acquirer  implementing a poison pill or otherwise creating features of newly issued preferred stock 
shares of our common stock eligible for public sale could cause the market price of our stock to drop  even if our business is doing well we currently have approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
certain shareholders hold large numbers of shares which they are able to sell in the public market 
significant sales of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of the performance of our business 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
our common stock is thinly traded 
consequently  it may be difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock  which may result in losses for investors the average daily trading volume  excluding block trades  for our common stock on the nasdaq national market was approximately  shares from january  through december  accordingly  the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations that may have been  and may continue to be  exaggerated due to the lack of an active trading market for our common stock 
this negative factor may make it difficult for shareholders to sell the company s common stock  which may result in losses for investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our cash and cash equivalents cash  securities held to maturity securities and line of credit  which are used to maintain liquidity and to fund capital expenditures and our expansion 
due to our large balance of cash and securities  our earnings and cash flows may be materially impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company intends to hold all of its securities until maturity  and therefore  should not bear any interest rate risk due to early disposition 
due to the relatively immaterial levels of our current debt which was zero as of december   our earnings and cash flows should not be materially impacted by changes in interest rates on our debt 
our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market rates 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate hedging transactions 
the table below presents the principal amounts of securities  along with the weighted average interest rates  fair values and expected maturity by year to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes as of december  fair value securities held to maturity non trading weighted average interest rate the fair value for securities was based on the quoted market price of such securities as of december  the company s securities are invested in federally tax exempt bonds 
the weighted average interest rate shown above is a combination of pre tax interest rate for taxable securities and an after tax interest rate for tax exempt securities 

table of contents as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented in the table has limited predictive value 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on those exposures or positions that arise during the period and interest rates
