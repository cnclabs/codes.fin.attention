item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands general overview we report our activities in four business segments inventory and logistic services  maintenance  repair and overhaul  manufacturing  and aircraft and engine sales and leasing 
sales in the inventory and logistic services segment are derived from the sale of a wide variety of new  overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and military markets  as well as the distribution of new airframe parts purchased from various original equipment manufacturers and sold to commercial and general aviation customers 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product primarily aircraft and engine parts and overhead primarily indirect labor  facility cost and insurance 
sales in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment are derived from the repair and overhaul of a wide range of commercial and military aircraft engine and airframe parts  landing gear and components  aircraft maintenance and storage  and the repair  overhaul and sale of parts for industrial gas and steam turbine operators 
cost of sales consists principally of cost of product primarily replacement aircraft parts  direct labor and overhead 
sales in the manufacturing segment are derived from the manufacture and sale of a wide array of containers  pallets and shelters used to support the us military s tactical deployment requirements  in plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial and military applications and advanced composite materials and components for aerospace and industrial use 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product  direct labor and overhead 
sales in the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment are derived from the sale and lease of commercial aircraft and engines and technical and advisory services 
cost of sales consists principally of cost of product aircraft and engines  labor and the cost of lease revenue primarily depreciation  lease expense and insurance 
the table below sets forth consolidated sales for our four business segments for each of the last three fiscal years ended may for the year ended may  sales inventory and logistic services    maintenance  repair and overhaul    manufacturing    aircraft and engine sales and leasing    as a result of the events of september   which occurred at a time when the worldwide commercial airline environment was already under significant pressure principally due to an economic downturn  most of the major us based commercial airlines announced substantial reductions in capacity  some in excess of 
commercial airlines accelerated their older generation aircraft fleet retirement plans 
the reduction in industry capacity and the financial impact of the events of september  on our customers had a significant negative effect on our fiscal sales and operating results as demand declined for our products and services within the inventory and logistic services  maintenance  repair and overhaul and aircraft and engine sales and leasing segments 
during fiscal  airline traffic began to strengthen and it appeared that the beginning of the airline industry recovery was underway 
however  during the third quarter of fiscal  demand for products and services from many of our airline customers weakened as a result of the war in iraq and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
during fiscal  sales of products and services to the us government  its agencies and its contractors increased primarily due to increased us military activity 
during fiscal  sales of our manufactured products and performance based logistics and supply chain management services continued to increase as a result of the us military s buildup and increased demand for supply chain management services 
although it is very difficult for us to predict the extent and duration of the military buildup and its impact on our near term results  we believe that we are well positioned with our current products and services and growth plans to benefit from longer term us military deployment and program management strategies 
total sales to the us government and its contractors for fiscal were  an increase of compared to fiscal  and represented of fiscal consolidated sales 
during fiscal  there have been positive signs the airline industry is improving  such as year over year improvement in available seat miles  revenue passenger miles and load factors 
however  rising fuel prices and high labor costs continue to threaten the commercial airline industry  and recently certain major us carriers warned they may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection 
low cost carriers with little or no infrastructure to support their maintenance requirements have gained market share from the major us carriers 
certain of these low cost carriers are flying newer aircraft which will generate demand for maintenance in future years 
we anticipate a fundamental shift in the way our airline customers manage their business  including intensified focus on cost control and increased use of third party maintenance providers 
we believe we are well positioned with our broad range of products and services as these trends develop 
factors which may affect future results our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected or fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of general economic conditions  geo political events  the commercial airline environment and other factors  including declining demand for our products and services and the ability of our customers to meet their financial obligations  declining market values for aviation products and equipment  difficulties in re leasing or selling aircraft and engines that are currently being leased  lack of assurance that sales to the us government  its agencies and its contractors which were of total sales in fiscal  will continue at levels previously experienced  access to the debt and equity capital markets and the ability to draw down funds under financing agreements  non compliance with restrictive and financial covenants contained in certain of our loan agreements  changes in or non compliance with laws and regulations that may affect certain of our aviation related activities that are subject to licensing  certification and other regulatory requirements imposed by the faa and other regulatory agencies  both domestic and foreign  competition from other companies  including original equipment manufacturers  some of which have greater financial resources than us  exposure to product liability and property claims that may be in excess of our substantial liability insurance coverage  and the outcome of any pending or future material litigation or environmental proceedings 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal were  which represents an increase of  or compared to fiscal in the inventory and logistic services segment  fiscal sales increased  or compared to fiscal the increase in sales compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to higher sales to the us military and its contractors for spares and logistics support and increased sales of engine parts 
in the inventory and logistic services segment  we experienced lower sales of parts to general aviation customers as a result of our strategic decision to de emphasize certain lower margin products 
going forward  we will continue our strategy of focusing on the distribution of higher margin products 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  fiscal sales increased  or compared with fiscal the increase in sales compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to higher sales at our aircraft maintenance facility due to an increase in the number of long term maintenance contracts with certain customers 
at certain of our component repair facilities  demand for component repair from our commercial airline customers has not recovered  and as a result we experienced lower sales compared to the prior year 
in the manufacturing segment  fiscal sales increased  or compared to fiscal the increase in sales compared to the prior year is due to record shipments of our manufactured products which support the us military tactical deployment activities 
in the manufacturing segment  we experienced lower sales of our non aviation composite structure products as a result of the completion of a major contract in may in the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment  fiscal sales decreased  or 
sales in this segment remain at historically low levels 
consolidated gross profit increased  or compared with the prior year 
the increase in our consolidated gross profit is primarily due to the increase in sales and an increase in our consolidated gross profit margin to from in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off an investment in a joint venture see note and the associated  pre tax charge was recorded in cost of sales on the consolidated statement of operations 
the gross margin percentage increased in the inventory and logistic services segment primarily due to the mix of inventories sold and in the manufacturing segment primarily due to increased volume at our facilities that manufacture products supporting the us military s tactical deployment activities 
fiscal gross profit included the  impairment reserve recorded in may operating income increased  compared with the prior year primarily due to the increase in gross profit 
during fiscal  our selling  general  administrative and other expenses increased by  compared with fiscal primarily as a result of a provision for an unfavorable judgement in the amount of  a provision for a customer allowance of  and slightly higher personnel costs  partially offset by a gain recorded from the sale of a facility located in holtsville  new york 
interest expense decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased average borrowings 
during the third quarter of fiscal  upon completion of our fiscal federal income tax return  we determined that we qualified for additional tax benefits of related primarily to higher than estimated margin on export activities 
this benefit was recorded in the third quarter 
in addition  our effective tax rate for fiscal reflects increased expected tax benefits related to current year export activities 
as a result of these items  we recorded a tax benefit of  for the fiscal year ended may  as a result of the factors discussed above  we reported net income of  for fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal were  which represents a decrease of  or compared to fiscal in the inventory and logistic services segment  fiscal sales declined  or compared to fiscal the decrease in sales compared to the prior year was attributable to a  reduction in sales to general aviation customers as a result of management s decision to reduce its investment in the low margin general aviation market by eliminating most general aviation branch locations and reducing staff levels 
in the inventory and logistics services segment  we experienced increased sales to the us military for spares and logistics support and higher sales of serviceable parts to certain program customers 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  fiscal sales declined  or compared to fiscal the decrease in sales compared to the prior year was attributable to lower sales in the us  partially offset by increased component overhaul sales in europe primarily due to favorable changes in currency translation rates 
in the manufacturing segment  fiscal sales increased  or as we experienced record demand for our manufactured products which support the us military deployment activities 
increased shipments of our non aviation related composite structure products also contributed to higher sales within this segment 
in the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment  fiscal sales declined  or 
sales in this segment are principally comprised of lease revenues from aircraft and engines on lease to operators  as well as sales of aircraft and engines 
sales in this segment remain historically low  reflecting the lack of sales activity caused by the aviation industry wide reduction in demand for capital assets post september  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded impairment charges related to certain engine and airframe parts and whole engines in the amount of  the fiscal impairment charge was based upon an updated assessment of the net realizable values for certain engine and airframe parts and future undiscounted cash flows for whole engines 
of the  impairment charge recorded during fiscal   was related to the inventory and logistic services segment  and  related to the aircraft and engine sales and leasing segment 
consolidated gross profit  before consideration of impairment charges in fiscal and  decreased  or as a result of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal the reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin was primarily attributable to lower margins experienced in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  as well as lower volume through most of the facilities within that segment  partially offset by an increase in the gross profit margin in the manufacturing segment due principally to increased volume and the mix of products sold 
including the effect of the impairment charges recorded in fiscal and  consolidated gross profit increased  operating income  before consideration of impairment and other special charges  decreased  as a result of lower sales and a reduction in the consolidated gross profit margin  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  we reduced our selling  general and administrative expenses by  or principally as a result of lower personnel costs and reduced discretionary spending 
interest expense decreased compared to the prior year principally due to decreased average borrowings during fiscal interest income decreased  over the prior year due to a decline in average cash invested during the fiscal year and lower interest rates 
our effective tax benefit rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the fiscal income tax benefit includes a  reduction in income tax expense representing the reversal of federal income tax liabilities 
this adjustment reduced federal and state income tax expense primarily recorded during the fiscal years through  related to incentives on exports and tax credits 
a change in tax law effective in fiscal regarding the computation of export incentives  combined with previous experience with tax examinations  resulted in the reduction in the tax expense 
we recorded a net loss of  during fiscal due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operating activities and met our commitments through the generation of cash from operations  augmented by the periodic issuance of common stock and debt in the public and private markets 
in addition to these cash sources  we also rely on secured credit arrangements  which currently include an accounts receivable securitization program and a secured revolving credit facility 
our continuing ability to borrow from our lenders and issue debt and equity securities to the public and private markets in the future may be negatively affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  airline and aviation industry conditions  geo political events  including the war on terrorism  and our operating performance 
our ability to use our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facility is also dependent on these factors 
our ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by our operating performance and working capital management 
we also have a universal shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission under which  subject to market conditions  up to  of common stock  preferred stock or medium or long term debt securities may be issued or sold 
at may   our liquidity and capital resources included cash of  and working capital of  as of may    of cash was restricted to support letters of credit 
at may   we had  available under our accounts receivable securitization program  no accounts receivable were securitized as of that date 
the amount available under this agreement is based on a formula of qualifying accounts receivable 
at may   we had  available under our secured revolving credit facility  no amounts were outstanding as of that date 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility is also based on a formula of qualifying assets 
as of may   unrestricted cash and amounts available to us under our secured credit arrangement and accounts receivable securitization program totaled  on february   we issued  principal amount of convertible notes due february  we used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase  of accounts receivable which had been sold under our accounts receivable securitization facility  to repay  of notes prior to their maturity  to repay  outstanding under our revolving credit facility  to retire  of notes payable due in june and to retire  of notes payable due in december see note 
in january  we refinanced non recourse notes of  with the maturity date extended to july accordingly  a portion of the non recourse debt has been classified as long term on the may  consolidated balance sheet 
as of may   our equity investment in the aircraft that secures the non recourse debt was  on october   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction whereby we sold and leased back a facility in garden city  new york 
net proceeds from the sale were  and were used in part to reduce our outstanding borrowings see note 
on july   we completed an  financing secured by a mortgage on our wood dale  illinois facility 
the term of the financing is five years utilizing a fifteen year amortization with a libor based interest rate of no less than 
on april   standard and poor s downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating to bb minus from bbb minus with an outlook rating of negative 
on july   standard and poor s upgraded our outlook rating from negative to stable 
on july   fitch ratings downgraded the unsecured debt rating to bb minus from bb plus and revised the outlook rating to negative from stable 
on august   moody s investors service downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b from b we were removed from credit watch following the downgrade actions by each of the respective rating agencies 
we continue to evaluate financing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms that will allow us to improve our liquidity position and finance future growth 
our ability to obtain additional financing is dependent upon a number of factors  including the geo political environment  general economic conditions  airline industry conditions  our operating performance and market conditions in the public and private debt and equity markets 
during the twelve month period ended may   we generated  of cash from operations primarily due to a reduction in inventories of  and  of non cash depreciation and amortization 
however  accounts and trade notes receivables increased  as a result of an increase in sales and the repurchase for cash of  of accounts receivable which had been sold under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
during the twelve month period ended may   cash provided from investing activities was  consisting primarily of proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our garden city  new york facility in the amount of  and proceeds from the sale of the holtsville  new york facility in the amount of  partially offset by capital expenditures of  we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be  to  reflecting increased investments in airframe maintenance and higher margin manufacturing capabilities 
during the twelve month period ended may   our financing activities used  of cash 
proceeds from borrowings during fiscal were  which included the issuance of  of convertible notes and  of financing secured by a mortgage on the wood dale  illinois facility  as well as proceeds from other borrowings of  reductions in borrowings during fiscal were  during the twelve month period ended may   we retired notes in the amount of  which matured on october    repaid  outstanding under the merrill lynch secured credit facility  repaid  of notes prior to their maturity  retired  of notes payable due in june  retired  of notes payable due in december and reduced other borrowings by  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements a summary of contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of may  is as follows payments due by period total due in fiscal due in fiscal due in fiscal due in fiscal due in fiscal after fiscal on balance sheet debt     non recourse debt bank borrowings off balance sheet aviation equipment operating leases     facilities and equipment operating leases      garden city operating lease purchase obligations we routinely issue letters of credit and performance bonds in the ordinary course of business 
these instruments are typically issued in conjunction with insurance contracts or other business requirements 
the total of these instruments outstanding at may  was approximately critical accounting policies and significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant estimates made by management include adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and equipment on or available for lease  allowance for doubtful accounts and loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce the value of customer accounts receivable to amounts expected to be collected 
in determining the required allowance  we consider factors such as general and industry specific economic conditions  customer credit history  and the customer s current and expected future financial performance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the specific identification  average cost or first in  first out methods 
provisions are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that have been impaired as a result of industry conditions 
we have utilized certain assumptions when determining the market value of inventories  such as historical sales of inventory  current and expected future aviation usage trends  replacement values and expected future demand 
principally as a result of the terrorist attacks of september  and its anticipated impact on the global airline industry s financial condition  fleet size and aircraft utilization  we recorded a significant charge for impaired inventories during the second quarter of fiscal utilizing those assumptions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional charge as a result of a further decline in market value for these inventories 
reductions in demand for certain of our inventories or declining market values  as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the market value of our inventories  could result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
equipment on or available for lease lease revenue is recognized as earned 
the cost of the asset under lease is original purchase price plus overhaul costs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated service life of the equipment  and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
the balance sheet classification is based on the lease term  with fixed term leases less than twelve months classified as short term and all others classified as long term 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we are required to test for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
when applying the provisions of sfas no 
to equipment on or available for lease  we have utilized certain assumptions when estimating future undiscounted cash flows  including current and future lease rates  lease terms  residual values and market conditions and trends impacting future demand 
differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future impairments of equipment on or available for lease 
aviation equipment operating leases from time to time we lease aviation equipment engines and aircraft from lessors under arrangements that are classified by us as operating leases 
we may also sublease the aviation equipment to a customer on a short or long term basis 
the terms of the operating leases in which we are the lessee are one year with options to renew annually at our election 
if we elect not to renew a lease or the lease term expires  we will purchase the equipment from the lessor at its scheduled purchase option price 
the terms of the lease agreements also allow us to purchase the equipment at any time during a lease at its scheduled purchase option price 
in those instances in which we anticipate that we will purchase aviation equipment and that the scheduled purchase option price will exceed estimated undiscounted cash flows related to the equipment  we record an accrual for loss 
we have utilized certain assumptions when estimating future undiscounted cash flows  such as current and future lease rates  residual values and market conditions and trends impacting future demand 
differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future provisions for losses on aviation equipment under operating leases 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain statements relating to future results  which are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of management  as well as assumptions and estimates based on information available to us as of the dates such assumptions and estimates are made  and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated  depending on a variety of factors  including those factors discussed under this item entitled factors which may affect future results 
should one or more of those risks or uncertainties materialize adversely  or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described 
those events and uncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond our control 
we assume no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands our exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under our credit agreements  foreign exchange rates and accounts receivable 
see part ii  item for a discussion on accounts receivable exposure 
during fiscal and  we did not utilize derivative financial instruments to offset these risks 
at may    was available under our secured revolving credit facility with merrill lynch capital 
interest on amounts borrowed under this credit facility is libor based 
as of may   the outstanding balance under this agreement was a hypothetical percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit facilities applied to the average outstanding balance during fiscal would have reduced our pre tax income by approximately during fiscal revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the period  and balance sheet accounts are translated at period end exchange rates 
balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical percent devaluation of foreign currencies against the us dollar would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
