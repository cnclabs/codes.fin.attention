item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company primarily operates and franchises mcdonald s restaurants 
in addition  the company operates certain non mcdonald s brands that are not material to the company s overall results 
of the more than  mcdonald s restaurants in over countries  more than  are operated by the company  approximately  are operated by franchisees and about  are operated by affiliates under license agreements 
regardless of who operates the restaurant  the company generally owns the land and building or secures long term leases for restaurant sites 
this ensures long term occupancy rights and helps control related costs 
revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates 
these fees primarily include rent  service fees and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales  with specified minimum rent payments 
fees vary by type of site  investment by the company and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have year terms 
we manage the business based on geographic segments united states  europe  asia pacific  the middle east and africa apmea  latin america and canada 
in addition  throughout this report we present a segment entitled other that includes non mcdonald s brands 
the us and europe segments account for approximately of total revenues 
france  germany and the united kingdom account for about of europe s revenues  australia  china and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method account for about of apmea s revenues  and brazil accounts for about of latin america s revenues 
these seven markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise approximately of total revenues 
in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including systemwide sales growth  comparable sales growth and company operated margins 
systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants  whether operated by the company  by franchisees or by affiliates 
while sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the company  management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because they are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base 
comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all systemwide restaurants in operation at least thirteen months 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because the company believes they better represent the underlying business trends 
strategic direction and financial performance in and  the company s results reflected a focus on growth through adding new restaurants  with associated high levels of capital expenditures and increasing levels of debt financing 
this strategy  combined with challenging economic conditions and increased competition in certain key markets  adversely affected results and returns on investment 
in  the company introduced a comprehensive revitalization plan to increase mcdonald s relevance to today s consumers as well as improve our financial discipline 
we redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants 
in line with this  we took a more disciplined approach to capital allocation and put a greater emphasis on controlling expenses 
we aligned the system around our customer focused plan to win  designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing 
this plan contains aggressive goals and measures for success based on the five drivers of exceptional customer experiences people  products  place  price and promotion 
our near term goal was to fortify the foundation of our business 
our long term goal is to create a differentiated customer experience one that builds brand loyalty and enables us to deliver attractive top and bottom line growth and returns on a sustained basis 
for and beyond  mcdonald s is targeting annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of percent to percent  annual operating income growth of percent to percent and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens 
return on incremental invested capital is the change in operating income plus depreciation divided by the change in gross assets 
these targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
we made significant progress in in operational excellence and leadership marketing 
we improved our core menu and added several successful new products 
we used more consistent  rigorous measurements such as evaluations by company personnel  independent mystery shoppers and customer research to evaluate restaurant performance 
using this information  along with enhanced training and other processes  we have strengthened our operations 
we have expanded our everyday value offerings  attracting more customer visits 
we began to create more relevant mcdonald s corporation restaurant environments by updating  rebuilding and relocating some of our restaurants 
we also introduced our first global marketing strategy  embodied by the i m lovin it theme  which emphasizes more contemporary music and images and is connecting with both our customers and our employees 
from a financial perspective  our results also improved in in concert with the company s strategic shift to emphasize growth from existing restaurants  management is focusing in particular on comparable sales and company operated margin trends  both of which gained momentum during the year 
performance in the us was impressive  with robust annual comparable sales and margin increases 
in europe  while comparable sales were slightly negative for the year  they improved sequentially each quarter  as did company operated margins  compared with the prior year 
apmea s comparable sales and company operated margins declined for the year  but both showed significant improvement in the second half 
as part of the company s revitalization plan  we eliminated projects not directly affecting our customers experience and narrowed non mcdonald s brand activities 
these actions along with the write down of a portion of our goodwill and restaurant assets resulted in the company recording million of pretax charges primarily noncash in highlights from the year included comparable sales increased  a significant improvement over the decline in consolidated revenues increased to a new record high of billion 
excluding the positive impact of currency translation  revenues increased systemwide sales increased 
excluding the positive impact of currency translation  systemwide sales increased 
net income per common share totaled  compared with in company operated margins as a percent of sales improved basis points  progressing toward our goal of increasing margins by basis points per year beginning in cash from operations increased million to billion  primarily driven by higher sales at existing restaurants and stronger foreign currencies 
capital expenditures were reduced by million to billion 
debt pay down totaled approximately million 
the annual dividend increased to more than million 
share repurchases totaled about million 
outlook for we expect to be a year of ongoing progress in operational excellence  leadership marketing and key financial metrics 
we will continue to focus our revitalization efforts on improving our customers experiences by providing better service  enhancing food taste  menu variety and value offerings  and creating more relevant marketing 
while we are confident in our plans for  we also are conscious of the challenges we face 
for example  we must continue to deliver solid results in the us  a very competitive marketplace  despite sequentially more difficult sales comparisons 
we believe that the combination of initiatives that benefited our us business in will continue to create positive momentum in outside the us  some key markets must increase customer relevance  while others have economic challenges 
we believe that we are in a better position to overcome these issues today than we have been for some time 
our plan is to leverage successes in the us and other markets like australia such as more relevant menus  strong value platforms  creative marketing and better restaurant level execution to improve results in additional markets around the world 
while the company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share  the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company s results 
changes in constant currency systemwide sales are driven by restaurant unit expansion and changes in comparable sales 
the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately one percentage point to sales and operating income growth in in constant currencies 
most of this anticipated growth will result from restaurants opened in the company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales 
however  as a perspective  assuming no change in cost structure a one percentage point increase in us comparable sales would impact annual earnings per share by about cents 
similarly  an increase of one percentage point in europe s comparable sales would impact annual earnings per share by about cents 
the company expects full year selling  general administrative expenses to be relatively flat to up slightly in constant currencies and to decline as a percent of revenues and systemwide sales  compared with however  due to the timing of certain expenses  the company expects selling  general administrative expenses to increase in the first half of and to decline in the second half  compared with a significant part of the company s operating income is from outside the us  and more than of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro and the british pound 
if the euro and the british pound both move in the same direction compared with average rates  mcdonald s corporation the company s annual earnings per share would change by about cents to cents 
in  foreign currency translation benefited earnings per share by cents 
for  the company expects its net debt principal repayments to be approximately million to million 
however  despite lower average debt balances  the company expects interest expense to be relatively flat compared with due to stronger foreign currencies 
the company expects the effective income tax rate for to be between and 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately billion to billion 
the company expects to return about billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in a number of factors can affect our business  including effectiveness of operating initiatives and changes in global and local business and economic conditions 
these and other risks are noted in the forward looking statements at the end of management s discussion and analysis

the lower closings were primarily due to management s reassessment of the plans as a result of the new strategic direction of the company 
in  the company recorded million of pretax charges consisting of million related to management s decision to close underperforming restaurants primarily in the us and japan  and million primarily related to the impairment of assets for certain existing restaurants in europe and latin america 
most of the restaurants identified for closing had negative cash flows and or very low annual sales volumes 
also  in many cases they would have required significant capital investment to remain financially viable 
mcdonald s corporation in  the company recorded million of pretax charges consisting of million related to the closing of underperforming restaurants in international markets  a million asset impairment charge in turkey  and million related to the disposition of aroma caf in the uk although restaurant closings occur each year  these restaurant closing charges in each year were identified as special charges because they were the result of separate intensive reviews by management in conjunction with other strategic actions

these results were partly offset by weak results in the uk and germany  although germany s performance improved in the second half of in and  apmea s revenues benefited from positive comparable sales in australia and expansion in china 
revenues were negatively affected in by weak results in hong kong  south korea and taiwan  compounded by consumer concerns about severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in several markets in the first half of the year

however  difficult economic conditions in germany and weak results in the uk negatively impacted results in both years 
despite the difficult economic conditions  germany s performance improved in the second half of apmea s constant currency results in reflected strong results in australia 
however  weak results in most other markets  compounded by concerns about sars in certain markets  negatively impacted the segment 
in  strong results in australia were more than offset by weak results in japan and hong kong 
latin america s operating income in constant currencies significantly declined in both and due to the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by several key markets in the segment 
in addition  latin america s results for both years were negatively impacted by higher provisions for uncollectible receivables 
the company is currently in litigation with about one third of the franchisees in brazil  which is negatively impacting the company s results in latin america 
we expect this to continue in the near term 
mcdonald s corporation operating margins operating margin information and discussions relate to mcdonald s restaurants only and exclude non mcdonald s brands 
company operated margins company operated margin dollars represent sales by company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants

capital expenditures for new restaurants decreased million or in because the company opened fewer restaurants and concentrated new restaurant investments in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long term growth 
while capital expenditures for existing restaurants decreased in  they increased as a percentage of total capital spending 
this is due to the company s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants including reinvestment initiatives such as restaurant reimaging in several markets around the world  including the us average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market

the company s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table 
while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus  it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt using a multiple of eight times rent expense after considering certain adjustments to more accurately reflect its total aggregate lease commitments 
these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents  excluding certain company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately of company operated restaurant leases outside the us  based on the company s estimate  capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense  and reducing total rent expense by approximately half of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites

on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
mcdonald s corporation long lived assets long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
restructuring and litigation accruals the company has recorded charges related to restructuring markets  closing restaurants  eliminating positions and other strategic changes 
the accruals recorded included estimates pertaining to employee termination costs  number of restaurants to be closed and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to franchisees  suppliers  employees  customers  competitors and intellectual property 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates 
the basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses

the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter
