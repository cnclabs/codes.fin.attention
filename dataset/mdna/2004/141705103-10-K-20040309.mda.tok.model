overview we are one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states 
our services assist employers  insurance companies  unions  government employee groups  managed care organizations and other sponsors of health benefit plans and individuals throughout the united states in delivering prescription drugs in a cost effective manner 
our pharmaceutical services are generally referred to as pharmacy benefit management  or pbm  services and involve the design and administration of programs aimed at reducing the costs and improving the safety  effectiveness and convenience of prescription drug use 
we generate our net revenue primarily from dispensing prescription drugs  either directly through our mail service pharmacies or indirectly through our network of third party retail pharmacies  and through providing certain other services  including disease management  health benefits management and data access to our customers 
our net revenue represents amounts billed to both customers and participants in our customers health benefit plans and includes copayments paid by participants both to us  for mail service prescriptions  and to the third party pharmacies in our retail network  for most retail prescriptions 
our net revenues reflect the effects of any discounts provided to our customers 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for detailed information concerning our revenue recognition policies 
we generate cost savings for our customers primarily by negotiating for the discounted purchase of pharmaceutical products dispensed to their participants 
we purchase pharmaceutical products from  and negotiate various forms of discounts from established list prices with  pharmaceutical manufacturers  pharmaceutical wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
when we purchase pharmaceutical products directly from their manufacturer  as is typically the case with generic and biotech products  we generally receive any negotiated discount at the time of purchase 
when we purchase pharmaceutical products indirectly eg through a wholesaler or from a retail pharmacy at the point of dispensing  as is typically the case with brand name  non biotech products  we generally receive a discount from both the vendor and the product s manufacturer 
in these cases  the vendor discount is received at the time of purchase  however  the manufacturer discount is received after the product is dispensed  in the form of a rebate 
our cost of revenues reflects the effects of these discounts 
the prices we have negotiated with our customers for the pharmaceutical products we dispense to their participants are generally based on contractual discounts from established list prices and may also include additional discounts based on the type ie preferred brand  non preferred brand  generic  etc 
of prescriptions filled 
the prices in our vendor contracts with various parties manufacturers  wholesalers  retail pharmacies  etc 
for the purchase of these pharmaceuticals are also based on discounts from established list prices plus  in many cases  additional discounts in the form of prompt payment terms and or rebates 
additionally  both our customer and vendor contracts typically contain clauses which would allow us to renegotiate pricing in the event that legislation or other events limiting or eliminating the various discounting practices in the pharmaceutical industry  including the practice of providing discounts in the form of rebates  were to occur 

table of contents we dispense prescription drugs on behalf of our customers through our four large  automated mail service pharmacies and our smaller regional mail service pharmacies 
we also maintain a nationwide network composed of over  retail pharmacies with which we have contracted to purchase pharmaceuticals on behalf of our customers for immediate delivery to their participants 
on september   we announced our intent to merge with advancepcs 
see item  business proposed merger with advancepcs for further information concerning this proposed merger 
critical accounting estimates income taxes 
we have a history of unprofitable operations from losses incurred in our discontinued ppm business 
the year was the first year out of the previous five in which we reported net income and taxable income 
these losses generated a sizeable tax net operating loss 
we had a total tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforward available to offset future taxable income of approximately billion as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the nol carryforward in relation to our history of unprofitable operations and to the continuing uncertainties surrounding our discontinued operations as discussed below  we historically did not recognize any of this net deferred tax asset for financial reporting purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  management concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize a significant portion of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching this conclusion  we recorded the estimated realizable value of the deferred tax asset and expect to provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which approximate under current tax rates  rather than the rate previously used 
due to the complexity of our discontinued operations divestiture  the fact that nols can be audited well beyond a normal three year statutory audit period and the inherent uncertainty of estimates of future taxable income  the amount of the nol which may ultimately be utilized to offset future taxable income may vary materially from our estimates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated realizable value of the deferred tax asset may cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments will remain unaffected until the nol is utilized 
estimates concerning contingencies 
generally accepted accounting principles specify the criteria for disclosing contingent losses and recording any related estimate of the loss amount 
these criteria are based on both probability assessments of the eventual outcome of the contingent event and on the availability of information necessary to estimate the amount of the loss 
if it is determined that i it is probable a material loss has been incurred and ii the amount of the loss can be reliably estimated  the nature of the loss should be disclosed  and an estimate of the loss should be recorded 
if it is reasonably possible that a material loss has been incurred  the nature of the possible loss should be disclosed along with an estimate of the amount of the loss if it is available 
to the extent that the incurrence of a material loss is judged remote  no disclosure is required 
the most significant contingencies to which we are exposed relate to damages sought by claimants under various lawsuits 
the specific cases for which we believe it may be reasonably possible that we have incurred a loss are discussed further at item  legal proceedings and in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
probability estimates related to the anticipated outcomes of lawsuits and to the amounts of damages which may ultimately be awarded are inherently uncertain 
we have made our estimates based on all available facts and circumstances existing as of the date such estimates were made 
although these estimates have been made based on our prior experience with litigation  our knowledge of the details of each case  and  in many cases  our consultation with external legal counsel  the actual outcome of pending litigation could differ materially from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
certain of our accounts receivable which are not subject to the trade receivables sales facility discussed at off balance sheet arrangements below are generated on a fee for service basis and are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to allow for expected credit losses based on our 
table of contents past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts to be adequate 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time 
we continually review and refine the estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible  however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these accounts receivable 
discontinued operations 
our financial statements are prepared using discontinued operations accounting for our discontinued ppm business 
under discontinued operations accounting  we accrued estimates of our expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through their eventual discharge  which  in many cases  was expected to be several years in the future 
there are primarily two remaining liabilities related to our discontinued ppm operations  leases and legal disputes  which continue to require significant judgments and estimates on the part of our management 
our accrual for lease liabilities could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
these factors are significantly dependent on the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
our accrual for legal disputes is based on our lawyers estimates of legal expenses and probable losses for eventual resolution of these disputes 
litigation or other proceedings could take several years to complete 
accordingly  actual legal fees and  possibly  damage awards or settlements  could differ significantly from our estimates 
while we believe our current estimates of discontinued operations liabilities are adequate  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
off balance sheet arrangements we have arranged to sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in certain of our trade accounts receivable to an unrelated third party  referred to as the conduit  under a million revolving trade receivables sales facility  which is described in further detail in note  trade receivable sales facility to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
at and during the year ended december   the company had sold no interests in its accounts receivable under this facility  and expenses associated with this facility totaled approximately million per year during each of the years ended december  and and million during the year ended december  transactions occurring under our trade receivables sales facility can be summarized as follows caremark generates accounts receivable from its customers through the ordinary course of business 
certain of these receivables are required to be sold to mp receivables company  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of caremark 
mp receivables only business activities relate to acquiring and selling interests in certain of caremark s receivables 
mp receivables is included with our other subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements  and the activity between caremark and mp receivables is eliminated during the consolidation process 

table of contents mp receivables sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in each individual receivable to the conduit at a discount and uses the cash collected on these receivables to purchase additional receivables from caremark 
additionally  mp receivables pays funds to  or receives funds from  the conduit for the discount on the purchased receivables which we include in interest expense or to increase or decrease the conduit s ownership percentage of its accounts receivable 
the business purpose of this arrangement is the provision of an ability to effectively accelerate collections on a portion of our accounts receivable as a source of funds in addition to cash on hand and availability under the revolving facility of our credit agreement for general corporate purposes 
the trade receivables sales facility represents a form of off balance sheet financing  since the conduit s ownership interest in mp receivables accounts receivable results in assets being removed from our balance sheet  rather than resulting in a liability to the conduit 
since the conduit purchases accounts receivable from mp receivables on a revolving basis  we currently have access to all of the cash collections on our accounts receivable 
upon the facility s termination  the conduit would be entitled to all cash collections on mp receivables accounts receivable until its net investment  which is currently zero  had been repaid 
because mp receivables and caremark are separate legal entities  the assets held by mp receivables would not be available to satisfy the claims of our creditors until after all amounts due and owing by mp receivables to the conduit have been paid in full 
we believe that the terms of the agreements governing this facility qualify our trade receivables sales transactions for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles  including fin as defined 
this treatment allows us to account for mp receivables transactions with the conduit as a sale of accounts receivable instead of reflecting the conduit s net investment as long term debt with a pledge of accounts receivable as collateral 
absent this sale treatment  our balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and long term debt  to the extent that amounts were outstanding under the facility  which could adversely impact our ability to raise capital 
our results of operations would not be impacted  however 
see historical liquidity and capital resources trade receivable sales facility 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to market our services profitably  which is  in turn  heavily dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate discounts for pharmaceutical purchases at various points in our supply chain  and to successfully increase market share and manage expense growth relative to revenue growth 
our future operating results and financial condition may be affected by a number of additional factors  including i identification of  and competition for  growth and expansion opportunities  ii declining reimbursement levels for  or increases in costs of  products distributed  iii exposure to liabilities in excess of our insurance  iv compliance with  or changes in  government regulation and legislation  including  but not limited to  pharmacy licensing requirements  hipaa and healthcare reform legislation  v adverse developments in any investigation related to the pharmaceutical industry that may be conducted by governmental authorities  vi adverse resolution of existing or future lawsuits  vii our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses  including the proposed merger with advancepcs  viii liquidity and capital requirements and ix our ability to successfully terminate leases and other contractual agreements related to our discontinued operations and the outcome of various legal disputes surrounding the closure or sale of our ppm business 
changes in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition 
there are various legal matters which  if adversely determined  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

table of contents cost of revenues excludes allocable depreciation of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts are included in total depreciation and amortization for each period 
operating income equals net revenue less cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization and integration planning and relocation expenses 
operating income is computed in accordance with sec rules  however  it is subject to the same limitations as our presentation of ebitda as described at below 
we believe that ebitda  which is a non gaap financial measure  is a supplemental measurement tool used by analysts and investors to help evaluate a company s overall operating performance  its ability to incur and service debt and its capacity for making capital expenditures 
we use ebitda  in addition to operating income and cash flows from operating activities  to assess our liquidity and performance and believe that it is important for investors to be able to evaluate our company using the same measures used by our management 
ebitda can be reconciled to net cash provided by continuing operations  which we believe to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  as follows in thousands year ended december  income from continuing operations depreciation and amortization interest expense  net provision for benefit from income taxes ebitda cash interest payments  net of interest income cash tax payments  net of refunds other non cash expenses other changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions disposals of businesses net cash provided by continuing operations ebitda does not represent funds available for our discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flow from operations data as measured under gaap 
the items excluded from ebitda are significant components of our statement of income and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of our overall financial performance 
ebitda and the associated year to year trends should not be considered in isolation 
our calculation of ebitda may not be consistent with calculations of ebitda used by other companies 
includes approximately billion  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of amounts paid by individual participants in our customers benefit plans directly to the third party pharmacies in our retail networks ie  retail copayments 
results of continuing operations for compared to net revenue 
net revenue increased by approximately billion to approximately billion in from approximately billion in increases in sales volumes  resulting primarily from net new customer additions and increases in the utilization of products  accounted for approximately billion  or  of the total increase in net revenue 
net revenue per prescription increases  primarily from drug cost inflation offset by increased generic utilization  accounted for an additional amount of approximately million  or of the increase in net revenue 
we estimate that increases in generic dispensing rates lowered the amount of drug cost inflation referred to above by approximately million during our other revenues presented in the preceding table are composed primarily of amounts billed for disease management services and for sales of de identified pharmaceutical data 
we recorded approximately million of data sales revenue in  compared to approximately million in  and this million decrease was mostly offset by an increase of approximately million in disease management revenues 

table of contents cost of revenues 
drug ingredient costs increased approximately billion to approximately billion in from approximately billion in volume increases  resulting primarily from net new customer additions and increases in the utilization of products  represented approximately billion  or  of this increase 
increases in drug ingredient costs per prescription  primarily from drug cost inflation  resulted in approximately million  or of the increase 
the rate of increase in drug ingredient costs per prescription was slightly higher than the rate of increase in net product sales revenue per prescription due to changes in the mix of mail and retail dispensing rates 
we expect that margins on pharmaceutical products sold in will remain relatively constant with that experienced in  absent consideration of the effects of the advancepcs merger 
pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenue increased in this increase corresponds primarily to increases in pharmacy operating costs necessary to service the increase in the volume of mail service pharmacy claims  coupled with expenses incurred for capacity additions to our mail service pharmacies made necessary by this growth 
although these expenses increased on an absolute basis  they decreased as a percent of net revenue  from in to in  due to our continued focus on gaining efficiencies through economies of scale and productivity improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute basis in to support the overall growth in our business and were partially offset by a reduction in the rate applied to revenue for allowances for credit losses due to favorable accounts receivable collection experience during selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue reflecting our continued focus on leveraging our existing infrastructure to grow our business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased in due primarily to the amounts and timing of depreciation related to capital expenditures made to increase capacities in our mail service pharmacies primarily completion of our arizona pharmacy and expansion of our texas pharmacy and our call centers 
absent consideration of the effects of the advancepcs merger  we expect that depreciation and amortization will increase to approximately million to million in as a result of the capital expenditures made in and the projected implementation dates of expenditures planned for interest expense  net 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted primarily from increased interest income generated by cash on hand 
integration planning and relocation expenses 
we recorded approximately million of expenses in related to integration planning activities with respect to the advancepcs merger and relocation expenses for moving our corporate headquarters to nashville  tennessee 
the amounts recorded for integration planning activities relate primarily to consulting expenses and other incremental direct costs incurred in the process of preparing for the closing of the advancepcs merger 
these expenses are expected to total an additional million to million in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was recorded at a effective tax rate  which approximates the effective federal and state income tax rate applicable to our consolidated income 
in  we recognized a benefit from income taxes associated with the elimination of the valuation allowance previously applied to our net deferred income tax asset as discussed in the results of continuing operations for compared to below 
results of continuing operations for compared to net revenue 
net revenue increased by approximately billion to approximately billion in from approximately billion in increases in sales volumes  resulting primarily from net new customer additions and increases in the utilization of products  accounted for approximately million  or  of the total increase in net revenue 
net revenue per prescription increases  primarily from drug cost inflation offset by increased generic utilization  accounted for an additional amount of approximately million  or 
table of contents of the increase in net revenue 
we estimate that increases in generic dispensing rates lowered the amount of drug cost inflation referred to above by approximately million during the acquisition of choice source on april   added approximately million of additional net revenue during our other revenues presented in the preceding table are composed primarily of amounts billed for disease management services and sales of de identified pharmaceutical data 
we recorded approximately million of data sales revenue in  compared to approximately million in cost of revenues 
drug ingredient costs increased approximately billion to approximately billion in from approximately billion in volume increases  resulting primarily from net new customer additions and increases in the utilization of products  represented approximately million  or  of this increase 
increases in drug ingredient costs per prescription  primarily from drug cost inflation  resulted in approximately million  or of the increase 
the rate of increase in drug ingredient costs per prescription was slightly lower than the rate of increase in revenue per prescription 
while several factors  including drug cost inflation  contribute to increases in both the revenue and drug ingredient cost per prescription  we were able to maintain a lower inflation rate in drug ingredient costs  primarily due to increases in direct discounts from manufacturers rebates as well as through increased generic utilization 
pharmacy operating costs and other costs of revenue increased in this increase corresponds primarily to increases in pharmacy operating costs necessary to service the increase in the volume of mail service pharmacy claims  coupled with expenses incurred for capacity additions to both our mail service pharmacies including the addition of a pharmacy in phoenix  arizona and customer service call centers including the addition of call centers in san antonio  texas and kansas city  missouri made necessary by this growth and by increased staffing levels necessary to support new customer contracts beginning on january  although these expenses increased on an absolute basis  they decreased as a percent of net revenue  from in to in  due to our continued focus on gaining efficiencies through economies of scale and productivity improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on an absolute basis in to support the overall growth in our business and includes increases due to the choice source acquisition  however  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue reflecting our continued focus on leveraging our existing infrastructure to grow our business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased in due primarily to the timing of capital expenditures being placed in service  offset by a reduction in amortization expense associated with the november restructuring of our contract with oxford health plans 
in  we implemented the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets concerning discontinuance of amortization of previously acquired goodwill  however  the implementation of this standard had no material impact on our amortization expense 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in net interest expense in resulted primarily from a reduction in both interest rates applicable to and amounts due under our credit facility and our trade receivables sales facility  both of which are subject to variable interest rates coupled with increased interest income generated by cash on hand 
income taxes 
the net benefit from income taxes of million compares to approximately million of income tax expense in and is composed of approximately million of current tax expense  which approximates the total amount of cash taxes we expect to pay related to our taxable income after utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  offset by a million deferred tax benefit 
this deferred tax benefit resulted from a reduction  in the fourth quarter of  of the valuation allowance previously recorded to reduce the book value of our net deferred tax asset to its estimated realizable value 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  we were required to record a valuation allowance to the extent that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits of this asset 
in the fourth quarter 
table of contents of  management determined that  based on our historical operating performance and on our reasonably expected future performance  we no longer met this criteria  and  accordingly reduced the valuation allowance 
for further information  see note  income taxes  to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
results of discontinued operations during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of approximately million  excluding related income tax benefits  for revised estimates of exit costs related to our discontinued ppm operations based on additional information from that existing in  when we recorded a similar charge 
the charge consisted of adjustments to accruals for potential future obligations primarily related to leases  triggered by changes in the commercial real estate market  and legal expenses  triggered by the progress of various litigation and or arbitration cases 
these amounts are estimates  and actual costs could differ from those recorded 
historical liquidity and capital resources general 
we broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing to meet our business objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
the following tables set forth selected information concerning our liquidity and capital resources and changes therein at and for the year ended december  dollars in millions summarized cash flows for the year ended december  net cash and cash equivalents provided by used in continuing operations investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents december  cash and cash equivalents december  balance sheet metrics december  december  net working capital days sales outstanding in accounts receivable days inventory on hand days expenses in payables long term debt fixed rate debt variable rate debt availability under revolving credit facility working capital equals total current assets minus total current liabilities 
includes both accounts payable and claims and discounts payable 

table of contents cash flows from continuing operations 
our performance relative to cash provided by continuing operations for the year ended december   resulted from factors discussed above related to ebitda and income from continuing operations coupled with focused management of working capital 
the decrease in days inventory on hand and increase in days expenses in payables are related primarily to the amounts and timing of inventory purchases and generated approximately million of cash flows from continuing operations in additionally  in december we purchased higher than normal inventory quantities to be able to service the significant amount of net new business which began on january   however  a similar purchase was not required in  since we expect the net customer additions in to be phased in throughout the year 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december   consist primarily of million of capital expenditures and million of cash outflows associated with acquisitions of businesses  of which approximately million related to the advancepcs merger 
cash flows from financing activities 
during the year ended december   we received net proceeds of approximately million from issuance of our common stock under employee benefit plans  including exercises of non qualified stock options 
this amount was significantly impacted by several of our former executives exercising options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
these former executives had  as of december   options to purchase approximately million additional shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of approximately per share 
these proceeds were offset by our purchases of  shares of our common stock on the open market for aggregate consideration of approximately million  the use of approximately million to repurchase a warrant which granted the holder the right to purchase  shares of our common stock and debt related payments of million 
cash flows from discontinued operations 
in addition to the amounts paid through december   to service liabilities which arose from our discontinued ppm operations  we have accrued approximately million of remaining liabilities related to our discontinued operations 
we expect to pay approximately million of this accrued amount during these amounts are estimates  and actual amounts could differ from those recorded 
working capital 
the increase in working capital from december  to december   is due primarily to our operating cash flow performance during the period and the proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock under employee benefit plans referred to above offset by capital expenditures and amounts paid in connection with the advancepcs merger 
credit facility 
we have a million credit facility with bank of america  na as administrative agent which consists of a million revolving credit facility maturing in march and a million term loan facility maturing in march at december   borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at variable rates based on the london inter bank offered rate libor  plus varying margins and consisted of outstanding term loans of million 
at december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility  exclusive of approximately million reserved under letters of credit 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries  secured by certain liens and pledges and contains restrictive covenants 
the security interests  guarantees and covenants applicable to the credit facility are described in further detail in note  long term debt and operating leases to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
senior notes 
our senior notes are in an aggregate principal amount of million and bear interest at annually  with all principal amounts due in october the indenture for the senior notes contains  among other things  restrictions on subsidiary indebtedness  sale and leaseback transactions and consolidation  merger and sale of assets 
the senior notes are not guaranteed by any subsidiary 
the indenture for the senior 
table of contents notes also contains restrictions on indebtedness secured by liens 
to comply with this covenant  we have secured the senior notes on an equal and ratable basis with the credit facility 
trade receivables sales facility 
we have arranged to sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in certain of our accounts receivable pursuant to a revolving period trade receivables sales facility which is described in further detail in note  trade receivable sales facility to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
at december   we had sold no interests in our accounts receivable into this facility and retained full availability of the million committed thereunder 
outlook liquidity and capital resources overview 
absent consideration of the advancepcs merger and tender offer  our liquidity needs currently arise primarily from i funding discontinued operations including the funding of any retained liabilities  ii commitments related to financing obtained through the issuance of long term debt  iii working capital requirements and iv capital expenditures 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and amounts available under our trade receivables sales facility and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs prior to the advancepcs merger and tender offer 
anticipated effects of the advancepcs merger and tender offer 
we anticipate that we will restructure our funding sources in conjunction with closing the advancepcs merger and tender offer 
management is currently negotiating specific details of this restructuring  which we expect to provide availability of approximately billion and to include term loan  revolving credit facility and accounts receivable backed borrowing components 
based on relevant balance sheet amounts reported by advancepcs and us as of december   and on our stock price at march   we would not have been required to borrow funds to close the advancepcs merger or to effect the tender offer 
the amount of cash which we may be required to borrow in order to effect the advancepcs merger and tender offer depends on several factors  including fluctuations in the price of our common stock and the amounts of available cash on hand for advancepcs and us on the closing date  which may be significantly different than amounts of cash on hand at december  each change in the average closing price of our common stock for the five trading days preceding the closing date of the advancepcs merger will result in a change of approximately million in the amount of cash required to effect the advancepcs merger 
stock repurchase program 
on july   we announced that we had adopted a plan to repurchase up to million of our common stock on the open market 
these repurchases will occur at times and in amounts permitted under our credit facility 
we have repurchased  shares for approximately million under this plan in and approximately million shares for an aggregate amount of approximately million under this plan to date 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments continuing operations 
we have various contractual obligations and or commercial commitments arising from both our continuing and discontinued operations 
these obligations and commitments are more fully described in this annual report on form k under various headings in md a as well as in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to our continuing operations at december  in millions payments due under contractual obligations total after long term debt term loan facility long term debt letters of credit long term debt senior subordinated notes operating leases

integration planning and relocation expenses 
we expect integration planning and relocation expenses for to total approximately million to million 
the significant majority of these costs are expected to be incurred in the first half of subsequent to closing the advancepcs merger  we may record additional expenses associated with post merger integration activities  however  we do not expect such amounts to be material to our post merger financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
planned capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures for to total approximately million to million  excluding any incremental capital expenditures incurred as a result of integrating facilities or information systems subsequent to consummation of the advancepcs merger 
discontinued operations 
future cash needed to fund the remaining liabilities of discontinued operations and estimated exit costs  which was estimated to be approximately million  in aggregate  at december   consisting primarily of accruals for real estate leases and legal disputes  will be funded by cash flows from continuing operations and  if necessary  by amounts available under our credit facilities 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund these payments  which we expect to total approximately million in we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising from our discontinued operations 
these primarily include obligations under various leases for commercial real estate 
these leases had aggregate remaining rental payments  net of amounts to be paid to us under subleases  of approximately million at december   due as follows million  million  million and after million 
these amounts represent totals for our net existing contractual obligations under these various leases and do not reflect our estimates of the effects of early termination 
additionally  we are named as guarantor or obligor on additional discontinued operations real estate leases which we assigned to third parties 
the aggregate amount of these guarantees totaled approximately million at december   and expire as follows million  million  million and after million 
additional information concerning the remaining contractual obligations and commercial commitments related to our discontinued operations can be found in note  discontinued operations and related contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements which appear beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
deferred income taxes 
at december   we had a cumulative income tax net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately billion available to reduce future amounts of taxable income 
if not utilized to offset future taxable income  these net operating loss carryforwards will expire on various dates through  with over of the total nol carryforward amount expiring from to in addition to these nol carryforwards  we have approximately million of future additional income tax deductions related to our discontinued operations 
the company also has a federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately million  which may be used to offset its ordinary federal corporate income taxes in the future 
under fas we are required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as for other temporary differences  if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset to offset future taxes 
in years prior to  management believed this to be the case  and  accordingly  fully reserved our net deferred income tax asset 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  management determined that  based on our historical operating performance and on our reasonably expected future performance  we no longer met this more likely than not criteria  and  accordingly reduced the valuation allowance

fin 
under fin  as amended  certain variable interest entities which were previously used as vehicles for off balance sheet financing were required to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entities which are their primary beneficiaries 
this requirement effectively eliminates the off balance sheet accounting treatment for many such entities 
the structure of our trade receivables sales facility  as previously described  is such that the provisions of fin  when adopted by us in  will result in no change in accounting for any of the transactions occurring thereunder 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  in which it established the criteria under which individual components of contractual arrangements with customers could be identified as separate units of accounting and accounted for as distinct revenue generating events under the existing accounting standards governing revenue recognition  including sab eitf is effective for contracts entered into after june   and could result in a delay in recognizing revenue under contracts where certain elements do not meet the criteria to be designated as separate units of accounting 
as previously mentioned  customers who contract with us for pharmaceutical benefits management services may also contract with us for other services  including disease management and or health benefits management 
these arrangements may be entered into in a single contract  and  in such an instance  this contract would represent the sale of multiple deliverables  thereby falling within the scope of eitf however  the utility of our pharmaceutical benefits management services is identical to customers regardless of their purchasing our disease management and or health benefits management services 
since these services are also frequently sold to customers at different times and under separate contracts  we believe that they meet the separability requirements of eitf  and  thus  represent separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
we have historically accounted for the revenues derived from such contracts in this manner  and our adoption of eitf in had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to debt outstanding under our credit facility and for the discount on revolving sales of accounts receivable under our trade receivables sales facility 
our earnings and the fair value of our fixed rate debt are subject to change as a result of movements in market interest rates 
at december   we had million of obligations which were subject to variable rates of interest 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of from the rate at december   would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately million  presuming that obligations subject to variable interest rates remained constant 
the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined based on only the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our outstanding obligations and do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment
