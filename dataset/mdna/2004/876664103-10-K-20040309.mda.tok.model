item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
the shopping center business there are several types of retail shopping centers  varying primarily by size and marketing strategy 
retail shopping centers range from neighborhood centers of less than  square feet of gla to regional and super regional shopping centers 
retail shopping centers in excess of  square feet of gla are generally referred to as regional shopping centers  while those centers having in excess of  square feet of gla are generally referred to as super regional shopping centers 
nineteen of our centers are super regional centers 
in this annual report on form k  the term regional shopping centers refers to both regional and super regional shopping centers 
the term gla refers to gross retail space  including anchors and mall tenant areas  and the term mall gla refers to gross retail space  excluding anchors 
the term anchor refers to a department store or other large retail store 
the term mall tenants refers to stores other than anchors that are typically specialty retailers and lease space in shopping centers 
business of the company we  as managing general partner of the operating partnership  are engaged in the ownership  management  leasing  acquisition  development  and expansion of regional shopping centers 
the centers o are strategically located in major metropolitan areas  many in communities that are among the most affluent in the country  including new york city  los angeles  san francisco  denver  detroit  phoenix  miami  dallas  tampa  orlando  and washington  dc  o range in size between  and million square feet of gla and between  and  square feet of mall gla 
the smallest center has approximately stores  and the largest has over stores 
of the centers  are super regional shopping centers  o have approximately  stores operated by its mall tenants under approximately  trade names  o have anchors  operating under trade names  o lease most of mall gla to national chains  including subsidiaries or divisions of the limited the limited  express  victoria s secret  and others  gap gap  gap kids  banana republic  and others  and foot locker  inc foot locker  lady foot locker  champs sports  and others  and o are among the most productive measured by mall tenants average per square foot sales in the united states 
in  mall tenants had average per square foot sales of  which is significantly greater than the average for all regional shopping centers owned by public companies 
the most important factor affecting the revenues generated by the centers is leasing to mall tenants primarily specialty retailers  which represents approximately of revenues 
anchors account for less than of revenues because many own their stores and  in general  those that lease their stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants 
our portfolio is concentrated in highly productive super regional shopping centers 
of the centers  had annual rent rolls at december  of over million 
we believe that this level of productivity is indicative of the centers strong competitive position and is  in significant part  attributable to our business strategy and philosophy 
we believe that large shopping centers including regional and especially super regional shopping centers are the least susceptible to direct competition because among other reasons anchors and large specialty retail stores do not find it economically attractive to open additional stores in the immediate vicinity of an existing location for fear of competing with themselves 
in addition to the advantage of size  we believe that the centers success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics  such as design  layout  and amenities 
business strategy and philosophy we believe that the regional shopping center business is not simply a real estate development business  but rather an operating business in which a retailing approach to the on going management and leasing of the centers is essential 
thus we o offer a large  diverse selection of retail stores in each center to give customers a broad selection of consumer goods and variety of price ranges 
o endeavor to increase overall mall tenants sales by leasing space to a constantly changing mix of tenants  thereby increasing achievable rents 
o seek to anticipate trends in the retailing industry and emphasizes ongoing introductions of new retail concepts into our centers 
due in part to this strategy  a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first mall stores in the centers 
in addition  we have brought to the centers new to the market retailers 
we believe that the execution of this leasing strategy has been unique in the industry and is an important element in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity 
o provide innovative initiatives that utilize technology and the internet to heighten the shopping experience  build customer loyalty and increase tenant sales 
one such initiative is our taubman center website program  which connects shoppers and retailers through an interactive content driven website and a robust direct email program 
more than of the managed centers tenants provide content on a weekly basis for the program 
the centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse  in depth presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to facilitate customer shopping 
while some centers include stores that target high end  upscale customers  each center is individually merchandised in light of the demographics of its potential customers within convenient driving distance 
our leasing strategy involves assembling a diverse mix of mall tenants in each of the centers in order to attract customers  thereby generating higher sales by mall tenants 
high sales by mall tenants make the centers attractive to prospective tenants  thereby increasing the rental rates that prospective tenants are willing to pay 
we implement an active leasing strategy to increase the centers productivity and to set minimum rents at higher levels 
elements of this strategy include terminating leases of under performing tenants  renegotiating existing leases  and not leasing space to prospective tenants that though viable or attractive in certain ways would not enhance a center s retail mix 
potential for growth our principal objective is to enhance shareholder value 
we seek to maximize the financial results of our core assets  while also pursuing a growth strategy that primarily includes an active new center development program 
internal growth we expect that of our future growth will come from our existing core portfolio and business 
although we ve always had a culture of intensively managing our assets and maximizing the rents from tenants  we re committed to improving the processes that significantly impact the core portfolio in order to drive even better performance 
our core business strategy is to maintain a portfolio of properties that deliver above market profitable growth by providing targeted retailers with the best opportunity to do business in each market and targeted shoppers with the best local shopping experience for their needs 
we are working on three endeavors that we believe will lead to achievement of our key mission to deliver above market profitable growth 
our first endeavor is to become an even more customer centric company than we are today  which will enable us to make better decisions driven by a fact based understanding of what retailers and shoppers want 
our second endeavor is to become more operationally excellent  which will enable us to achieve competitive cost efficiencies  greater discipline  and more timely processes and decision making 
this is especially important as our competitors search for economies of scale in increasingly larger operations 
our third endeavor is to achieve profitable growth  which we ve defined as maintaining the highest tenant sales and sales growth in the industry  and accelerating core operations growth over time 
we believe further integrating these basic strategic themes throughout the organization will serve to coordinate and prioritize all of our efforts to achieve our strategy 
we ve identified the key drivers to achieve our core business strategy 
these drivers fall into four categories people drivers  organizational drivers  customer drivers and financial drivers 
these drivers served as a basis for the companywide initiatives we worked on in and that we believe will establish a strong foundation for improved core performance 
we made progress on our initiatives  including the implementation of a new lease process software package in  which will help reduce the time between a tenant leaving a space and a new tenant paying rent in that space 
in addition  in a year which we ve experienced significant early tenant terminations  we ve worked to maximize income by increasing the number of temporary tenants 
also  we ve made improvements to our tenant grading system to ensure that the system is a strong predictor of a new tenant s ability to pay contract rent for its entire term and to establish risk parameters for each asset to guide our leasing team 
we re continuing to work on these and other initiatives to improve core performance 
we strongly believe that focusing management attention on these initiatives will improve our performance on these drivers and by establishing specific benchmarks and goals for these drivers  which we can measure year after year  we will have set the stage for future strong core operations growth 
development of new centers we are pursuing an active program of regional shopping center development 
we believe that we have the expertise to develop economically attractive regional shopping centers through intensive analysis of local retail opportunities 
we believe that the development of new centers is an important use of our capital and an area in which we excel 
at any time  we have numerous potential development projects in various stages 
the mall at millenia  a million square foot center in which the operating partnership has a interest  opened in october in orlando  florida 
stony point fashion park  a  square foot wholly owned center  opened september  in richmond  virginia 
northlake mall  a million square foot wholly owned center in charlotte  north carolina is currently under construction and is scheduled to open september  our approximately million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists of costs relating to our oyster bay project in syosset  new york 
refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations planned capital spending regarding the status of this project 
our policies with respect to development activities are designed to reduce the risks associated with development 
we generally do not intend to acquire land early in the development process 
instead  we generally acquire options on land or form partnerships with landholders holding potentially attractive development sites 
we typically exercise the options only once we are prepared to begin construction 
the pre construction phase for a regional center typically extends over several years and the time to obtain anchor commitments  zoning and regulatory approvals  and public financing arrangements can vary significantly from project to project 
in addition  we do not intend to begin construction until a sufficient number of anchor stores have agreed to operate in the shopping center  such that we are confident that the projected sales and rents from mall gla are sufficient to earn a return on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital 
having historically followed these principles  our experience indicates that  on average  less than of the costs of the development of a regional shopping center will be incurred prior to the construction period 
however  no assurance can be given that we will continue to be able to so limit pre construction costs 
unexpected costs due to extended zoning and regulatory processes may cause our investment in a project to exceed this historic experience 
while we will continue to evaluate development projects using criteria  including financial criteria for rates of return  similar to those employed in the past  no assurances can be given that the adherence to these policies will produce comparable results in the future 
in addition  the costs of shopping center development opportunities that are explored but ultimately abandoned will  to some extent  diminish the overall return on development projects see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital spending for further discussion of our development activities 
strategic acquisitions our objective is to acquire existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of our portfolio or can be redeveloped to that level and that satisfy our strategic plans and pricing requirements 
during we acquired o a interest in waterside shops at pelican bay in naples  florida 
o an additional interest in macarthur center  bringing our ownership in the shopping center to 
o the minority interest in great lakes crossing  bringing our ownership in the shopping center to 
expansions of the centers another potential element of growth is the strategic expansion of existing properties to update and enhance their market positions  by replacing or adding new anchor stores or increasing mall tenant space 
most of the centers have been designed to accommodate expansions 
expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center construction in terms of scope and cost  requiring governmental and existing anchor store approvals  design and engineering activities  including rerouting utilities  providing additional parking areas or decking  acquiring additional land  and relocating anchors and mall tenants all of which must take place with a minimum of disruption to existing tenants and customers

additionally  a jcpenney expansion and newly constructed macy s opened in september

rental rates as leases have expired in the centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following tables contain certain information regarding per square foot minimum rent at the comparable centers  which exclude the discontinued operations at biltmore fashion park  la cumbre plaza  and paseo nuevo  as well as centers opened or acquired during through average minimum rent per square foot all mall tenants stores opening during year square feet of gla opened    stores closing during year square feet of gla closed    lease expirations the following table shows lease expirations based on information available as of december  for the next ten years for the centers in operation at that date lease expiration year number of leases expiring leased area in square footage annualized base rent under expiring leases in thousands annualized base rent under expiring leases per square foot percent of total leased square footage represented by expiring leases a higher percentage of space at value centers arizona mills  dolphin mall  and great lakes crossing is typically rented to major and mall tenants at lower rents than the portfolio average 
excluding value centers  the annualized base rent under expiring leases is greater by a range of to or an average of for the periods presented within this table 
excludes leases that expire in for which renewal leases or leases with replacement tenants have been executed as of december  table excludes waterside shops at pelican bay 
we believe that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative of what will occur in the future because of several factors  but principally because of early lease terminations at the centers 
for example  the average remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period to was approximately two years 
the average term of leases signed during and was approximately seven years 
in addition  mall tenants at the centers may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in the termination of such tenants leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow 
in  approximately of leases were so affected compared to in this statistic has ranged from to since we went public in since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
occupancy for comparable centers  leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy were   and  respectively  in  and   and  respectively  in mall tenant average occupancy  ending occupancy  and leased space rates of all centers are as follows year ended december leased space ending occupancy average occupancy major tenants no single retail company represents or more of our revenues 
the combined operations of the limited  inc accounted for approximately of mall gla as of december  and of minimum rent 
no other single retail company accounted for more than of mall gla or of minimum rent

additionally  these same factors will influence our decision whether to go forward on the development of new centers and may affect the ultimate economic performance and value of projects under construction see other risks associated with the development of new centers under business of the company development of new centers 
such factors include o changes in the national  regional  and or local economic and geopolitical climates  o competition from other shopping centers  discount stores  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs  direct mail  and the internet in attracting customers and tenants  o increases in operating costs  o the public perception of the safety of customers at the shopping centers  o environmental or legal liabilities  o availability and cost of financing  and o uninsured losses  whether because of unavailability of coverage or in excess of policy specifications and insured limits  including those resulting from wars  acts of terrorism  riots or civil disturbances  or losses from earthquakes or floods 
in addition  the value of shopping centers may be adversely affected by o changes in government regulations  and o changes in real estate zoning and tax laws 
adverse changes in the economic performance and value of shopping centers would adversely affect our income and cash available to pay dividends 
third party interests in the centers some of the shopping centers are partially owned by non affiliated partners through joint venture arrangements 
as a result  we do not control all decisions regarding those shopping centers and may be required to take actions that are in the interest of the joint venture partners but not our best interests 
bankruptcy of mall tenants or joint venture partners we could be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of third parties 
the bankruptcy of a mall tenant could result in the termination of its lease which would lower the amount of cash generated by that mall 
in addition  if a department store operating an anchor at one of our shopping centers were to go into bankruptcy and cease operating  its closing may lead to reduced customer traffic and lower mall tenant sales which would  in turn  affect the amount of rent our tenants pay us 
the profitability of shopping centers held in a joint venture could also be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of one of the joint venture partners if  because of certain provisions of the bankruptcy laws  we were unable to make important decisions in a timely fashion or became subject to additional liabilities 
investments in and loans to third parties we occasionally extend credit to third parties in connection with the sale of land or other transactions 
we have occasionally made investments in marketable and other equity securities 
we are exposed to risk in the event the values of our investments and or our loans decrease due to overall market conditions  business failure  and or other nonperformance by the investees or counterparties 
third party contracts we provide property management  leasing  development  and other administrative services to centers owned by general motors pension trusts  other third parties and to certain taubman affiliates 
the contracts under which these services are provided may be canceled or not renewed or may be renegotiated on terms less favorable to us 
certain overhead costs allocated to these contracts would not be eliminated if the contracts were to be canceled or not renewed 
inability to maintain status as a reit o we may not be able to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes with the result that the income distributed to shareholders will not be deductible in computing taxable income and instead would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates 
although we believe we are organized and operate in a manner to maintain our reit qualification  many of the reit requirements of the internal revenue code are very complex and have limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
changes in tax laws or regulations or new administrative interpretations and court decisions may also affect our ability to maintain reit status in the future 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  our income may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax 
if we do not maintain our reit status in any year  we may be unable to elect to be treated as a reit for the next four taxable years 
in addition  if we fail to meet the internal revenue code s requirement that we distribute to shareholders at least of our otherwise taxable income  less capital gain income  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax 
the internal revenue code does provide that an additional dividend payment may be declared and paid in the following taxable year so that we will be deemed to have distributed at least of our taxable income to shareholders and thereby maintain our reit status 
the excise tax is due and payable on the additional dividend payment made in the succeeding tax year in order to meet the distribution requirement 
o although we currently intend to maintain our status as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax  or other considerations may cause us to determine that it would be in our and our shareholders best interests to revoke our reit election 
as noted above  if we revoke our reit election  we will not be able to elect reit status for the next four taxable years 
environmental matters all of the centers presently owned by us not including option interests in certain pre development projects or any of the real estate managed but not included in our portfolio have been subject to environmental assessments 
we are not aware of any environmental liability relating to the centers or any other property  in which we have or had an interest whether as an owner or operator that we believe  would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  or results of operations 
no assurances can be given  however  that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner  operator  or current occupant has created an environmental condition not known to us 
moreover  no assurances can be given that future laws  ordinances  or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of the centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the centers  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the centers such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to us 
personnel we have engaged the manager to provide real estate management  acquisition  development  and administrative services required by us and our properties

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following statements regarding future developments and joint ventures  rents and returns  statements regarding the continuation of trends  and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs 
we caution that although forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information  these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks  uncertainties  and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the sec  and in particular those set forth under the headings general risks of the company and environmental matters in our annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc we  us  our or tco owns a managing general partner s interest in the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg  through which we conduct all of our operations 
the operating partnership owns  develops  acquires  and operates regional shopping centers nationally 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreement  development projects for future regional shopping centers  and the taubman company llc the manager 
shopping centers that are not controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
there are a number of items that affect the comparability of information used in measuring performance 
during  we opened stony point fashion park results of operations recent openings  acquired an interest in waterside shops at pelican bay  and sold our interest in biltmore fashion park results of operations acquisitions and dispositions 
during  we opened the mall at millenia results of operations recent openings 
also during  we acquired an interest in sunvalley and sold our interests in la cumbre plaza and paseo nuevo results of operations acquisitions and dispositions 
we opened four new shopping centers during  which are currently not at stabilization 
additional comparable center statistics that exclude biltmore  la cumbre plaza  the mall at millenia  paseo nuevo  stony point  sunvalley  waterside shops at pelican bay  and the centers that opened in are provided to present the performance of comparable centers in our continuing operations 
overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business is to lease space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term to years 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 
tenant rents and expense recoveries represent over of our total revenues 
we recently have experienced decreases in occupancy  primarily due to unscheduled tenant closings 
the impact on our income has been somewhat moderated by a significant increase in lease cancellation revenue and leasing to temporary in line tenants 
these trends are discussed under current operating trends 
the trend in tenant sales improved in sales per square foot in continued to lead the industry  while mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of sales are within our historical norms 
see mall tenant sales and center revenues and rental rates and occupancy 
the rents we are able to achieve are similarly affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
in  the spread between rents of tenants opening and those closing was within historical norms 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature 
refer to seasonality for these relationships  as well as descriptions of revenues that historically are not as predictable 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations 
we have been active in developing and expanding our shopping center portfolio  and we describe the most recent center openings  including stony point fashion park and the mall at millenia under recent openings 
also  over the last two years  we acquired additional interests in six centers and disposed of interests in three  as discussed under acquisitions and dispositions 
we similarly have been very active in managing our balance sheet  completing a series of new financings or refinancings of existing debt  as well as a series of stock buybacks  issuances of partnership equity  and redemptions of partners interests in trg  as outlined under debt transactions and equity transactions 
we believe good balance sheet management both for debt and equity will continue to minimize exposure to interest rate risk and ensure adequate liquidity over the coming years 
in the fall of  we received an unsolicited proposal from simon property group  which sought to acquire control of the company 
a tender offer and litigation were commenced but ultimately ended in as described under unsolicited tender offer 
we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues and recoveries from tenants 
we disclose the operating partnership s share of these sources of income under other income 
included in this income are lease cancellation income and gains on peripheral land sales  which in were at a historical high and close to a historical low  respectively 
the timing of this income is difficult to predict 
other sources of income derived from our shopping centers  such as parking garage and sponsorship income  have been increasing 
we provide property management  leasing  development  and other administrative services to centers owned by general motors pension trusts  other third parties  and certain taubman affiliates 
the general motors pension trusts contracts are cancelable with days notice 
certain annual overhead costs allocated to these contracts would not be eliminated if they were to be canceled or not renewed 
certain significant transactions that occurred in  including financings and an acquisition of an additional interest in beverly center  are discussed in subsequent events 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make significant estimates when applying certain accounting policies 
background and discussion of these policies  including those related to the valuation of our shopping centers  capitalization of development costs  valuation of accounts receivable  and valuations for acquired property and intangibles  are contained under application of critical accounting policies 
with all the preceding information as background  we have then provided insight and explanations for variances in our financial results from through under comparison of to and comparison of to 
as information useful to understanding our results  we have described the presentation of our minority interest  the recent dispositions of interests in centers  and the reasons for our use of non gaap statistics such as ebitda and funds from operations ffo under presentation of operating results 
reconciliations from net income allocable to common shareowners to these statistics follow the annual comparisons 
our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under liquidity and capital resources begins with a brief overview of capital activities and transactions occurring in analysis of specific operating  investing  and financing activities is then provided in more detail 
cash flows from rents and recoveries provide the resources for payments of interest and other operating expenses  leasing costs  and generally for required distributions and dividends 
recent positive operating cash flow generated by new center openings  increases in rents  and other positive events offset the cash used in connection with the unsolicited tender offer 
similarly  significant capital outflows continue in connection with the construction of new centers and acquisitions  financed through sales of centers  debt  and certain equity issuances 
funding for new developments  acquisitions  and other capital spending typically is provided by new borrowings 
as new developments reach their expected stabilized occupancy  we may be able to refinance the assets for more than the original financings  providing additional resources for growth 
specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under beneficial interest in debt 
completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under sensitivity analysis 
in conducting our business  we enter into various contractual obligations  including those for debt  capital leases for property improvements  operating leases for office space and land  purchase obligations  and other long term commitments 
detail of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  is contained under contractual obligations 
property level debt represents the largest single class of obligations  in both total amount and near term maturity expected settlement 
described under loan commitments and guarantees and cash tender agreement are our significant guarantees and commitments 
development  renovation  and expansion of new and existing malls continues to be a significant use of our capital  as described in capital spending and planned capital spending 
recent spending includes that related to the recently opened stony point fashion park and the mall at millenia  and the currently under construction northlake mall 
a use of future capital may be for our planned oyster bay project in syosset  new york 
we hope to resolve entitlement issues and receive the necessary approvals to begin construction in late for a planned opening of this project 
dividends are also significant uses of our capital resources 
tax status of our dividends and the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under dividends 
we again increased our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of current operating trends since the regional shopping center industry has been affected by the softness in the national economy 
economic and geopolitical pressures that affect consumer confidence  job growth  energy costs  and income gains can affect retail sales growth and impact our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 
the impact of a soft economy on our current results of operations can be moderated by lease cancellation income  which tends to increase in down cycles of the economy 
during  we recognized our approximately million share of lease cancellation revenue  which exceeded historical averages  this level of lease cancellation income is not indicative of future periods see results of operations other income 
our sales statistics have shown improvement over the last nine months of see mall tenant sales and center revenues 
sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents approximately two percent percentage rents represent 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 
in  we experienced a decrease in occupancy from see rental rates and occupancy 
increased income from temporary in line tenants  which has become an integral part of our business  partially offsets the impact of lower occupancy in the portfolio 
temporary tenants  defined as those with lease terms less than months  are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics 
as of december   approximately of space was occupied by temporary tenants 
mall tenant sales and center revenues over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales mall tenant sales in thousands   sales per square foot minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales sales per square foot is presented for the comparable centers  excluding value centers arizona mills  dolphin mall  and great lakes crossing 
for the comparable centers  mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of sales were   and for   and  respectively 
tenant sales per square foot in increased by compared to sales per square foot have increased year over year for each of the last nine months of rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the shopping centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following table contains certain information regarding rentals at the comparable shopping centers average minimum rent per square foot average minimum rent per square foot stores opening during year square feet of gla opened    average minimum rent per square foot stores closing during year square feet of gla closed    the opening and closing rent statistics are not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
generally  the rent spread between opening and closing stores is in our historic range of to per square foot 
this statistic is difficult to predict in part because of unscheduled lease terminations  which may have actual average closing rents per square foot that vary from the average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations 
in  the square feet of gla opened decreased from  primarily due to certain large tenant spaces greater than  square feet that opened in during  the number of tenants opened in the comparable centers actually increased from the number of square feet of gla closed increased in due to a number of unscheduled lease terminations and bankruptcies 
mall tenant average occupancy  ending occupancy  and leased space rates are as follows all centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy comparable centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy a number of unscheduled lease terminations and bankruptcies accounted for the majority of the decline in comparable center occupancy 
tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was in  compared to in and in we are expecting a reversal of this decline in occupancy by mid and anticipate year end to be ahead of occupancy 
seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
included in revenues are gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income that may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total in thousands mall tenant sales      revenues      occupancy ending comparable average comparable ending average leased space comparable all centers because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries relative to sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter 
st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs results of operations recent openings stony point fashion park  a wholly owned regional center  opened september  in richmond  virginia

estimates regarding returns are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with tenants  timing of tenant openings  early lease terminations and bankruptcies  sales performance of the centers  and increases in operating costs 
acquisitions and dispositions in december  we sold our interest in biltmore fashion park to the macerich company 
the sales price consisted of million of cash and million in macerich partnership units which were then used as consideration for redeeming the former biltmore owners trg partnership interests  see equity transactions 
biltmore fashion park was encumbered by million of property level fixed rate debt maturing in july and bearing an interest rate of 
we recognized a gain of approximately million representing the excess of the sales price over the book value of our investment in the center 
also in december  we acquired a interest in waterside shops at pelican bay  located in naples  florida  for million in cash 
we are exploring redevelopment opportunities along with the forbes company  which is managing the center 
in july  we acquired an additional interest in macarthur center  bringing our ownership in the shopping center to  for million in cash and  operating partnership units 
although the number of units issued was determined based on a negotiated value of per unit  these units have been recorded based on our common share price of as of the closing date of july  in march  we acquired the minority interest in great lakes crossing for million in cash  pursuant to a favorable pricing formula pre established in the partnership agreement  bringing our ownership in the center to 
in october  we acquired swerdlow real estate group s swerdlow s interest in dolphin mall  bringing our ownership in the shopping center to

the december repurchase transaction  which occurred immediately following the sale of biltmore fashion park  included the transfer of the macerich units received from the sale to several operating partnership unitholders in redemption and retirement of their operating partnership units 
these unitholders were the original owners of biltmore fashion park 
the partnership units issued in connection with the may investment have the same attributes as existing partnership units  except that they do not have voting rights and have limited resale rights for a specified period of time 
an affiliate of the investor owned an interest in beverly center  which we purchased in january see subsequent events 
in march  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our common stock in the open market 
for each share of our stock repurchased  an equal number of our operating partnership units are redeemed 
in february  our board of directors authorized the expansion of the existing buyback program to repurchase up to an additional million of our common shares 
as of december   we had purchased  and the operating partnership had redeemed  approximately million shares and units for approximately million 
the december repurchase transaction was separately authorized by the board and does not count against the amount of buybacks authorized under the share buyback program 
unsolicited tender offer in the fall of  we received an unsolicited proposal from simon property group  inc spg seeking to acquire control of tco 
the proposal was subsequently revised 
thereafter  a tender offer was commenced by spg and later joined by a subsidiary of westfield america trust westfield 
our board of directors rejected the proposal and recommended that the shareholders not tender their shares pursuant to spg s and westfield s tender offer 
spg filed suit against us to enjoin the voting of our series b non participating convertible preferred stock based on a variety of legal theories 
in october  spg and westfield withdrew their tender offer  and tco and spg mutually agreed to end the litigation 
during we incurred approximately million in costs  in connection with the unsolicited tender offer and related litigation  offset by insurance recoveries of million 
during  million of costs were incurred 
no further costs are expected to be incurred 
other in july  may company announced that it intends to divest of its lord taylor stores  including four at our centers 
as may company s press release outlined  the company has decided to exit certain markets in the south and southwest including florida  texas  and colorado 
this impacts cherry creek  international plaza  wellington green  and willow bend 
may had also announced in its press release that it will continue to fulfill its obligations under existing documents to operate each store until satisfactory arrangements can be negotiated to divest each location 
we are continuing discussions with may and expect that a mutually satisfactory and positive solution for each center will be found 
we previously had investments in certain technology companies merchantwired and fashionmall 
com for which charges of million and million were recorded during the years ended december  and  respectively  when events and circumstances indicated their carrying amounts were not recoverable 
in october  we committed to a restructuring of our development operations 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded primarily representing the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  positions were eliminated within the development department 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and its related amendments and interpretations  which establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
the initial adoption of sfas resulted in a reduction to income of approximately million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and a reduction to other comprehensive income oci of million 
these amounts represented the transition adjustments necessary to mark our share of interest rate agreements to fair value as of january  other income we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenues from management  leasing  and development services  as summarized in the following table 
while gains on peripheral land sales in were less than in the prior year  we expect that gains on land sales will be about million 
interest income in decreased primarily due to the settlement of a note receivable 
lease cancellation income is dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and is difficult to predict  prior to  it had averaged between million and million 
lease cancellation income was unusually high due mostly to a small number of tenants who shifted their business strategy and closed stores that had only recently opened 
in  lease cancellation revenue is expected to be significantly lower than in and is currently estimated to be approximately million 
estimates regarding anticipated other income are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with tenants  counterparties  and potential purchasers of peripheral land  and timing of transactions

in   and  revenues recognized related to these services  net of costs of providing the services  were million  million  and million  respectively 
the amount in decreased from due to the acquisition of the interest in sunvalley and the completion of a short term contract 
the general motors pension trusts contracts are cancelable with days notice 
certain annual overhead costs of between million and million allocated to these contracts would not be eliminated if they were to be canceled or not renewed 
subsequent events in january  we completed a million refinancing on beverly center 
the year mortgage loan carries an all in interest rate of 
proceeds were used to pay off the million mortgage  million of the wellington construction loan  all of the outstanding balances on the lines of credit  and transaction fees 
the net impact of this financing is expected to be an increase in interest expense of million for also in january  we purchased the additional ownership of beverly center from sheldon gordon and the estate of e 
phillip lyon 
consideration of approximately million for this interest consisted of million in cash and  of newly issued partnership units valued at per unit 
the price of the acquisition was determined pursuant to a option agreement between us and a partnership controlled by mr 
gordon and mr 
lyon 
we have carried the million net exercise price as a liability on our balance sheet 
we already recognized of the financial results of the center in our financial statements 
in february  the million loan on woodland was repaid by the joint venture partners 
we used borrowings under a line of credit for our share of the repayment 
also in february  we completed a million refinancing  secured by a mortgage on dolphin mall 
the loan matures in february and may be extended for a total of three years 
the loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus 
the payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by trg 
proceeds from the financing were used to repay the existing million loan 
subsequent to these financings  of our debt was fixed rate and was floating  not including the impact of hedge instruments 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers all properties  including those under construction and or owned by joint ventures  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment would be recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  and expected holding period 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent an impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value is charged against operations 
there were no impairment charges recognized in the periods covered within this annual report 
as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations refer to presentation of operating results 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 
our approximately million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists of costs relating to our oyster bay project in syosset  new york 
refer to planned capital spending regarding the status of this project 
valuation of accounts receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent over of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was approximately of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenant leases during the year 
since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important given the application of sfas and for the allocation of purchase price between land  buildings and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is currently effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective for us on july  the provisions of sfas had no impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities and the conditions under which they should be included in consolidated financial statements 
fin is effective for the first interim or annual period ending after december  in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r fin r  which served to clarify guidance in fin  and provided additional guidance surrounding the application of fin we adopted the provisions of fin r during the fourth quarter of  evaluating the equity at risk and other characteristics of our financial interests in our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
the adoption did not change the entities that we currently consolidate in our financial statements 
presentation of operating results the following tables contain the operating results of our consolidated businesses and the unconsolidated joint ventures 
income allocated to the minority partners in the operating partnership and preferred interests is deducted to arrive at the results allocable to our common shareowners 
because the net equity of the operating partnership is less than zero  the income allocated to the minority partners is equal to their share of distributions 
the net equity of these minority partners is less than zero due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses 
distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
amounts allocable to minority partners in certain consolidated joint ventures are added back or deducted to arrive at our net results 
our average ownership percentage of the operating partnership was in and in both and the results of dolphin mall are presented within the consolidated businesses subsequent to its october acquisition 
prior to that date  they are included within the unconsolidated joint ventures 
in december  we sold our interest in biltmore fashion park 
the results of biltmore fashion park and the results of la cumbre plaza and paseo nuevo  including the gains on their disposition in  are presented as discontinued operations 
the operating results in the following tables include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents the operating partnership s share of the earnings before interest and depreciation and amortization  excluding gains on sales of depreciated operating properties of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
our presentation of ffo is not necessarily comparable to the ffo of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the nareit definition 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap

liquidity and capital resources in the following discussion  references to beneficial interest represent the operating partnership s ownership share of the results of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we do not have  and have not had  any parent company indebtedness  all debt discussed represents obligations of the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and joint ventures 
capital resources are required to maintain our current operations  complete construction underway  pay dividends  and fund planned capital spending for future developments and other commitments and contingencies 
we believe that our net cash provided by operating activities  distributions from our joint ventures  the unutilized portions of our credit facilities  and our ability to access the capital markets assure adequate liquidity to meet current and future cash requirements and will allow us to conduct our operations in accordance with our dividend and financing policies 
the following sections contain information regarding our recent capital transactions and sources and uses of cash  beneficial interest in debt and sensitivity to interest rate risk  and historical capital spending 
we then provide information regarding our anticipated future capital spending  covenants  commitments  and contingencies  and dividend policies 
summaries of capital activities and transactions as of december   we had a consolidated cash balance of million 
additionally  we have a secured million line of credit 
this line had million of borrowings as of december  and expires in november with a one year extension option 
we also have available a second secured bank line of credit of up to million 
this line had million outstanding as of december  and expires in november see subsequent events regarding repayment of the balances under these lines of credit in january during  we sold biltmore fashion park  acquired additional interests in macarthur center and great lakes crossing as well as an interest in waterside shops at pelican bay  completed and opened stony point fashion park  and began construction on northlake mall 
additionally  financings of approximately million were completed relating to the shops at willow bend  the mall at millenia  and great lakes crossing  and million was invested into our operating partnership by an affiliate 
an additional million was invested in the operating partnership as part of our purchase of the additional interest in macarthur center 
in total we have issued million in equity at an average price of per share 
also during  we purchased approximately million shares under our share repurchase program at an average price of and completed a million partnership unit redemption as part of the biltmore sale  at a price of 
the total of these equity transactions resulted in a reduction of million shares at a net cost of per share 
these transactions are more fully described in results of operations 
operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in  increases in cash from a full year of operations at the mall at millenia  increases in average rents per square foot  lease cancellation revenue  and net recoveries  and additional operating cash flows due to the opening of stony point fashion park in september were offset by cash spent in connection with the unsolicited tender offer 
in  cash provided by operating activities increased from primarily due to the full year of operating cash flow provided by the new centers opening throughout investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million provided in and million used in cash used in investing activities was impacted by the timing of capital expenditures  with additions to properties and or contributions to joint ventures in   and for the construction of dolphin mall  international plaza  the mall at millenia  northlake mall  stony point fashion park  the mall at wellington green  and the shops at willow bend  as well as other development activities and other capital items 
a tabular presentation of capital spending is shown in capital spending 
additionally  million was used in to acquire interests in waterside shops at pelican bay  macarthur center  and great lakes crossing  while million was used in in connection with acquiring interests in arizona mills  dolphin mall  and sunvalley 
sources of cash used in funding these investing activities included sales of interests in centers and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures  as well as the financing activities described in the next section 
in  the sale of biltmore provided million  while the sales of paseo nuevo and la cumbre plaza provided million 
distributions in excess of earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures provided million in  million in  and million in in  these distributions included million of excess proceeds from the march refinancing of the mall at millenia  while in million of excess proceeds were received from the westfarms refinancing and million was repaid to us from borrowings under the dolphin construction loan 
net proceeds from sales of peripheral land were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the timing of land sales is variable and proceeds from land sales can vary significantly from period to period 
cash used in or provided by investing activities is also affected by certain infrequently occurring or peripheral activities 
during and  million and million were invested in technology related ventures  respectively 
as of december   there were no investments in or obligations relating to technology related ventures 
dividends received from investments in technology companies were million and million in and  respectively 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million of cash used in  and million of cash provided in net cash used in or provided by financing activities was primarily impacted by cash requirements of the investing activities described in the preceding section 
proceeds from the issuance of debt  net of payments and issuance costs  were million in  compared to net repayments of million in and net borrowings of million in in  we used million from the issuance of partnership units to fund repurchases of our common stock 
these repurchases totaled million in stock repurchases of million were made in connection with our stock repurchase program in issuance of stock pursuant to the continuing offer related to the exercise of employee options contributed million in  million in  and million in total dividends and distributions paid were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
beneficial interest in debt at december   the operating partnership s debt and its beneficial interest in the debt of its consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures totaled  million with an average interest rate of excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and the effects of interest rate hedging instruments 
these costs are reported as interest expense in the results of operations 
recognition of these costs added to trg s effective interest rate during included in beneficial interest in debt is debt used to fund development and expansion costs 
beneficial interest in assets on which interest is being capitalized totaled million as of december  beneficial interest in capitalized interest was million for the following table presents information about our beneficial interest in debt as of december  amounts may not add due to rounding amount interest rate including spread libor lock swap rate in millions of dollars fixed rate debt  floating rate debt swapped through june swapped through september swapped through september floating month to month total floating rate debt total beneficial interest in debt  amortization of financing costs average all in rate represents weighted average interest rate before amortization of financing costs 
this debt is also swapped from october through april at 
financing costs include financing fees  interest rate cap premiums  and losses on settlement of derivatives used to hedge the refinancing of certain fixed rate debt 
in addition  as of december   million of our beneficial interest in floating rate debt is covered under interest rate cap agreements with libor cap rates ranging from to with terms ending august through july subsequent events refer to results of operations regarding the refinancings of beverly center and dolphin mall  and the repayment of woodland s mortgage debt 
sensitivity analysis we have exposure to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and interest rate instruments 
we use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposure to interest rate risks inherent in variable rate debt and refinancings 
we routinely use cap  swap  and treasury lock agreements to meet these objectives 
based on the operating partnership s beneficial interest in floating rate debt in effect at december   excluding debt fixed under interest rate swaps  a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates on this floating rate debt would decrease or increase cash flows by approximately million and  due to the effect of capitalized interest  annual earnings by approximately million 
based on our consolidated debt and interest rates in effect at december   a one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million  while a one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately million 
contractual obligations in conducting our business  we enter into various contractual obligations  including those for debt  capital leases for property improvements  operating leases for office space and land  purchase obligations primarily for construction  and other long term commitments

of this amount  million has already been paid in through refinancings of beverly center and dolphin mall 
the new million loan on beverly center matures in the new million loan on dolphin mall matures in and can be extended for a total of three years 
the remaining property level debt consists of amortization of mortgage principal payments and the balance on the mall at wellington green loan 
this loan can be extended a total of two years 
proceeds from the beverly center refinancing in the first quarter of were used to completely pay down the existing lines of credit 
as of december   we were contractually liable for million of this planned spending 
see planned capital spending for detail regarding planned funding 
excludes purchase agreements with cancellation provisions of days or less 
other long term liabilities consist of various accrued liabilities  most significantly assessment bond obligations and long term incentive compensation

loan commitments and guarantees certain loan agreements contain various restrictive covenants  including minimum net worth requirements  minimum debt service and fixed charges coverage ratios  a maximum payout ratio on distributions  a minimum debt yield ratio  and a leverage ratio  the latter two being the most restrictive 
the operating partnership is in compliance with all of its covenants 
certain debt agreements  including all construction facilities  contain performance and valuation criteria that must be met for the loans to be extended at the full principal amounts  these agreements provide for partial prepayments of debt to facilitate compliance with extension provisions 
a partial prepayment on the wellington construction loan was made in january in anticipation of the loan extension in may payments of principal and interest on the loans in the following table are guaranteed by the operating partnership as of december  the stony point fashion park and the mall at wellington green loan agreements provide for a reduction of the amounts guaranteed as certain center performance and valuation criteria are met

cash tender agreement a 
alfred taubman has the annual right to tender to us units of partnership interest in the operating partnership provided that the aggregate value is at least million and cause us to purchase the tendered interests at a purchase price based on a market valuation of tco on the trading date immediately preceding the date of the tender the cash tender agreement 
at a 
alfred taubman s election  his family  and certain others may participate in tenders 
we will have the option to pay for these interests from available cash  borrowed funds  or from the proceeds of an offering of our common stock 
generally  we expect to finance these purchases through the sale of new shares of our stock 
the tendering partner will bear all market risk if the market price at closing is less than the purchase price and will bear the costs of sale 
any proceeds of the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of tco 
based on a market value at december  of per common share  the aggregate value of interests in the operating partnership that may be tendered under the cash tender agreement was approximately million 
the purchase of these interests at december  would have resulted in our owning an additional interest in the operating partnership

for the year ended december   in addition to the costs above  we incurred our million share of capitalized leasing costs and our million share of consolidated businesses and million share of unconsolidated joint ventures repair and asset replacement costs that will be reimbursed by tenants 
also during this period  our share of reimbursements by tenants for capitalizable expenditures of prior periods was million for consolidated businesses and million for unconsolidated joint ventures 
the expenditures reimbursable by the tenants and the related reimbursements are classified as recoverable expenses and expense recoveries  respectively  and both are included in our funds from operations

the center is scheduled to open september  and is expected to cost approximately million 
we expect returns on this investment to be approximately at stabilization 
future construction costs for northlake mall will be funded through our existing credit facilities until construction financing is obtained 
the financing is expected to be completed in our approximately million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists of costs relating to our oyster bay project in syosset  new york 
both neiman marcus and lord taylor have committed to the project and retailer interest has been very strong 
although we still need to obtain the necessary entitlement approvals to move forward with the project  we are encouraged by six straight court decisions in our favor 
while the timing of decisions in the continuing litigation process is uncertain  the entitlement litigation is likely to be resolved within a year 
we expect continued success with the ongoing litigation  and assuming we are able to begin construction in late  we would expect to open the center in late we ve exercised our option to acquire the land and expect to make a payment of million to close the transaction in april the amount of additional spending on this project in is dependent upon the timing of resolution of the litigation and municipal approvals

the operating partnership anticipates that its share of costs for development projects scheduled to be completed in will be as much as million in estimates of future capital spending include only projects approved by our board of directors and  consequently  estimates will change as new projects are approved 
we are currently exploring redevelopment opportunities at waterside shops at pelican bay 
potential costs related to this project are excluded from the table above 
estimates regarding capital expenditures  occupancy  and returns on new developments presented above are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with anchors  tenants  and contractors  changes in the scope and number of projects  cost overruns  timing of expenditures  financing considerations  actual time to complete projects  changes in economic climate  competition from others attracting tenants and customers  increases in operating costs  timing of tenant openings  and early lease terminations and bankruptcies 
dividends we pay regular quarterly dividends to our common and series a preferred shareowners 
dividends to our common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to us  our financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareowners  as well as meet certain other requirements 
preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends 
the preferred stock became callable in october although we have not committed to refinance this equity  we are investigating various alternatives 
on december   we declared a quarterly dividend of per common share payable january  to shareowners of record on december  the board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of per share on our series a preferred stock  paid december  to shareowners of record on december  dividends declared on our common and preferred stock and their tax status are presented in the following tables year dividends per common share declared return of capital ordinary income rate long term capital gain pre rate long term capital gain post unrecaptured section capital gains year dividends per series a preferred share declared ordinary income rate long term capital gain pre rate long term capital gain post unrecaptured section capital gains the portion of the dividends paid to common and preferred shareowners in for capital gains and unrecaptured section gains are designated as capital gain dividends for tax purposes 
the tax status of total common dividends declared and to be declared  assuming continuation of a per common share quarterly dividend  is estimated to be approximately return of capital  and approximately ordinary income 
the tax status of total dividends to be paid on series a preferred stock is estimated to be ordinary income 
these are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including the amount of dividends declared  changes in our share of anticipated taxable income of the operating partnership due to the actual results of the operating partnership  changes in the number of our outstanding shares  property acquisitions or dispositions  financing transactions  including refinancing of existing debt  changes in interest rates  amount and nature of development activities  and changes in the tax laws or their application 
the annual determination of our common dividends is based on anticipated funds from operations available after preferred dividends  as well as assessments of annual capital spending  financing considerations  and other appropriate factors 
over the past several years  we have determined that the growth in common dividends would be less than the growth in funds from operations 
we expect to evaluate our policy and the benefits of increasing dividends at a higher rate than historical increases  subject to our assessment of cash requirements 
any inability of the operating partnership or its joint ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts  capital expenditures and changes in working capital  including development activities and expansions  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations  thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the operating partnership and funds available to us for the payment of dividends
