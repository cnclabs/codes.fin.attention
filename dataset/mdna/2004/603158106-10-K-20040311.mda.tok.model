item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing and administrative expenses research and development expenses bad debt expenses restructuring charges write down of impaired assets income from operations income before provision for taxes on income and minority interests provision for taxes on income minority interests income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income executive summary at minerals technologies  more than of our sales are to customers in two industries papermaking and steelmaking 
the economic downturn of the past three years has had severe effects on the paper industry  by far our largest customer group  as paper mills have closed or taken significant downtime and the industry has consolidated 
the effect on the steel industry has been even more dramatic  with several large steelmakers having sought bankruptcy protection 
although the overall economy began to improve in late and early  the paper and steel industries have been slow to participate in the recovery  and have reduced their output while maintaining pricing pressure on their suppliers 
even in this very difficult business environment  our sales increased by from to  about half of this increase being the favorable effect of foreign exchange 
this was despite the loss of approximately customers to bankruptcy  and the effect of an agreement with our largest customer  international paper  which reduced our sales in the short run  but which we believe will add significant value over the next several years 
our operating income  essentially flat from to  decreased in by as a result of charges taken for workforce reductions and asset impairments 
our net income  however  after increasing from to  increased a further in  primarily because of a one time reduction in our effective tax rate from about to about 
the comparison of our operating income and net income in the past three years has been affected by a number of factors in  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million for workforce reductions  in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a satellite pcc plant at a paper mill which was permanently shut down  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  in the first quarter of  which resulted in a charge to earnings of about million  net of tax and annual ongoing costs of approximately per share  because of the expiration of the statute of limitations on our us tax returns  we reversed certain tax accruals for earlier years  increasing our net income in by about million  the impact of the revisions to the international paper contracts reduced earnings by approximately per share in  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges relating to a reduction of approximately in our worldwide workforce  the planned closure of the facility at river rouge  michigan  which we acquired in as part of the refractory business of martin marietta materials  and the retirement of some synsil product manufacturing assets  which had been made obsolete by improvements in the production process 
the total effect was to reduce pretax income by about million 
we face some significant risks and challenges in the future our success depends in part on the performance of the industries we serve  particularly papermaking and steelmaking 
our customers continue to face a very difficult business environment  and may experience further shutdowns or bankruptcies  the recent wave of consolidations in the paper and steel industries concentrates purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as mti  most of our pcc sales are under long term contracts with paper companies at whose mills we operate satellite pcc plants  when they reach their expiration dates these contracts may not be renewed  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us  the cost of employee benefits  particularly health insurance and pension expense  has risen significantly in recent years and continues to do so  although the synsil products family has produced favorable reactions from potential customers and we have signed one supply contract  this product line is not yet profitable and its commercial viability cannot be assured  and as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns 
despite these difficulties  we are optimistic about the opportunities for continued growth that are open to us  including increasing our sales of pcc for paper by further penetration of the markets for paper filling at both free sheet and groundwood mills  increasing our sales of pcc for paper coating  particularly from the coating pcc facility under construction in walsum  germany  which we expect will be completed in september  continuing research and development activities for new products  in particular our joint project with international paper to develop and implement a filler fiber composite technology  achieving market acceptance of the synsil family of synthetic silicate materials for the glass industry  increase market penetration in the refractories segment through higher value specialty products and application systems 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these opportunities 
results of operations sales dollars in millions of total sales growth of total sales growth of total sales net sales us 
international pcc products processed minerals products specialty minerals segment refractories segment net sales worldwide net sales in increased from the previous year to million 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on sales of approximately million or percentage points of growth 
sales in the specialty minerals segment  which includes the pcc and processed minerals product lines  increased to million compared with million for the same period in sales in the refractories segment grew over the previous year to million 
in  worldwide net sales increased to million from million in the prior year 
specialty minerals segment sales increased approximately and refractories segment sales increased approximately in worldwide net sales of pcc in increased to million from million in the prior year 
paper pcc volumes grew slightly for the full year with volumes in excess of million tons 
in  united states printing and writing paper shipments were down percent  and demand for uncoated freesheet  our largest market for pcc was down percent  compared with sales of pcc for paper were adversely affected by these decreases in production 
in addition  one paper mill at which we have a satellite plant in millinocket  maine  has been idled since december the implementation of the international paper agreements also had a negative impact on sales 
however  the favorable effect of foreign exchange more than offset these factors 
in the third quarter we also began operation of a one unit pcc plant in malaysia at a paper mill owned by sabah forest industries sdn 
bhd 
a unit represents between  to  tons of annual pcc production capacity 
sales of specialty pcc decreased slightly because of poor industry conditions and competition in the calcium supplement market from ground calcium carbonate 
pcc sales in increased approximately to million from million in paper pcc sales and volumes grew for the full year  even though the paper industry was affected adversely by consolidations  shutdowns and slowdowns 
net sales of processed minerals products in increased to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of polar minerals inc full year sales excluding polar minerals increased approximately due to strong demand from the residential construction related industries and from new polymer and health care applications for our talc products 
processed minerals net sales in increased to million from million in net sales in the refractories segment in increased to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in sales for the refractories segment was primarily attributable to increased sales of equipment and application systems in europe and the favorable impact of foreign exchange 
in  net sales in the refractories segment increased from the prior year 
the increase in sales in was attributable primarily to the acquisitions of the martin marietta refractories business and rijnstaal bv business  which more than offset unfavorable economic conditions in the worldwide steel industry 
net sales in the united states was million in  approximately higher than in the prior year 
increased sales from the acquisitions were partially offset by the aforementioned weakness in the steel and paper industries 
international sales in increased primarily as a result of the impact of foreign exchange 
in  domestic net sales were higher than the prior year due primarily to acquisitions  and international sales were approximately greater than in the prior year primarily due to the international expansion of our pcc product line and acquisitions 
on may   we reached a two part agreement with international paper company ip that extended eight satellite precipitated calcium carbonate plant supply contracts and gave us an exclusive license to patents held by ip relating to the use of novel fillers  such as pcc fiber composites 
we made a one time million payment to ip in exchange for the contract extensions and technology license 
approximately million of this payment was attributed to the revisions to the contracts  including extensions of their lives  and will be amortized as a reduction of sales over the remaining lives of the extended contracts 
the result was a reduction of sales of approximately million in  an anticipated overall reduction of approximately million per year over the next five years  and smaller reductions thereafter over the remaining lives of the contracts 
in addition  prices were adjusted at certain of the ip facilities covered by the contract extensions 
the overall impact of the revisions to the ip contracts was to reduce earnings by approximately per share in in october  we signed our first commercial contract with a major glass manufacturer for use of our synsil 

products 
operating costs and expenses dollars in millions growth growth cost of goods sold marketing and administrative research and development bad debt expenses restructuring charges write down of impaired assets percentage not meaningful cost of goods sold was of sales compared with in the prior year 
our production margin increased at approximately the same rate as sales 
in the specialty minerals segment  production margins increased despite a sales growth 
margins in this segment were affected by the shutdown of the millinocket satellite pcc plant  continuing development costs in the coating pcc program  the effect of the revisions to the ip contracts  and weakness in the specialty pcc product line 
in the refractories segment  production margins increased  almost double the sales growth 
this was due to an improved product mix  increased equipment sales  and improved manufacturing operations 
marketing and administrative costs increased in to million and represented of net sales from of net sales in the refractories segment increased marketing expenses to support worldwide business development efforts 
in addition  we realized higher information technology costs associated with the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system  and incurred higher employee benefit costs  particularly pension and medical expenses 
in  marketing and administrative costs increased to million and decreased to of net sales from of net sales in research and development expenses increased to million and represented of net sales due to increased product development activities in both segments 
in  research and development expenses decreased and represented of sales 
this decrease was primarily the result of the restructuring  a decrease in pcc trial activity and a shift of synsil product activities from development to production 
we recorded bad debt expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
these charges were primarily related to additional provisions associated with potential risks to our customers in the steel  paper and other industries and several customer bankruptcy filings 
during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our operations to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency 
this resulted in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring charges relate to workforce reductions from all business units throughout our worldwide operations and the termination of certain leases 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down of impaired assets of million 
the impairment charges are related to the planned closure of our operations in river rouge  michigan  in and the retirement of certain synsil assets that have been made obsolete 
in  we recorded a write down of impaired assets of million for a satellite plant that ceased operations 
income from operations dollars in millions growth growth income from operations income from operations in decreased to million from million in income from operations decreased to of sales as compared with of sales in this decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned restructuring and impairment costs 
excluding these charges  income from operations was of net sales and increased 
income from operations for the specialty minerals segment decreased to million and was of its net sales 
excluding the restructuring and impairment asset charges  operating income of this segment was of its net sales and down from the prior year 
the margins of this segment continue to be affected in the near term by the ip agreement and the millinocket temporary shutdown 
operating income for the refractories segment increased to million and was of its net sales 
excluding the restructuring and impairment of asset charges  operating income of this segment was of its net sales and increased from the prior year 
the improvement in operating income was primarily due to an improved product mix  increased equipment sales  and more efficient manufacturing operations 
non operating deductions dollars in millions growth growth non operating deductions  net non operating deductions decreased from the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower interest expense and lower average borrowings in when compared with in  interest expense decreased from due primarily to lower average borrowings than in provision for taxes on income dollars in millions growth growth provision for taxes on income the effective tax rate decreased to in compared with in this decrease was due to the reversal of certain tax accruals during the second half of as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations on the us tax returns for certain earlier years 
this one time  non cash item reduced the income tax provision by million 
the effective tax rate was in minority interests dollars in millions growth growth minority interests the consolidated joint ventures continue to operate profitably but decreased approximately million from the prior year due to higher support costs at our joint venture in indonesia 
net income dollars in millions growth growth net income income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased to million from million in diluted earnings per common share before the cumulative effect of the accounting change increased to compared with in effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
establishes the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a non cash  after tax charge to earnings of approximately million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change related to retirement obligations associated with our pcc satellite facilities and mining properties  both within the specialty minerals segment 
as a result of this pronouncement  we recorded in cost of goods sold additional depreciation and accretion expenses of approximately million in the pro forma effect on results  assuming that sfas no 
were applied retroactively  would be a non cash  after tax charge to earnings of approximately million in net income increased in to million 
in  net income increased to million 
earnings per common share  on a diluted basis  increased to in as compared with in the prior year 
outlook in  despite pronouncements of economic recovery  we continued to see weakness in the two main industries we serve paper and steel 
however  unlike a number of manufacturers  we continue to show growth in sales and net income 
we are hopeful that the improvement in the rest of the us economy will carry through to the paper and steel industries  and feel confident that we have taken the necessary steps to position ourselves for continued growth and improved profitability in the coming year 
we continue to be affected by negative factors in the industries we primarily serve in  the pcc business was affected by paper mill shutdowns  curtailments in production due to weakened demand  and the temporary shutdown of the satellite pcc plant in maine 
the steel industry continued to experience difficulties in as several steel manufacturers ceased operations and eight north american steel companies filed for bankruptcy protection 
however  despite this difficult market environment  we were able to achieve low double digit operating margins 
our operating margin as a percentage of sales  before restructuring and impairment of asset charges  declined to in as compared with in reported operating income as a percentage of sales was in as compared with in in  we plan to continue our focus on the following growth strategies increase market penetration of pcc in paper filling at both free sheet and groundwood mills 
increase penetration of pcc into the paper coating market 
emphasize higher value specialty products and application systems to increase market penetration in the refractories segment 
continue selective acquisitions to complement our existing businesses 
continue research and development and marketing efforts for new and existing products 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
in  we added one unit of production capacity for pcc from a satellite plant built at a paper mill owned by sabah forest industries in malaysia 
this plant became operational in the third quarter of in addition  we added one unit of capacity through an expansion at an existing satellite pcc facility 
in august  we announced that our merchant pcc plant in walsum  germany will be operational in september the project was announced in may  and since then  we have received the necessary regulatory  planning and permitting approvals from state and local agencies 
the initial capacity of the modular plant will be  metric tons of pcc for paper coating 
we also made the following acquisition in on september   the assets of isa manufacturing inc  a company that produces pre cast shapes primarily for the steel industry 
in  we expect additional expansions at existing satellite pcc plants to occur and also expect to sign contracts for new satellite pcc plants 
as we continue to expand our operations overseas  we face the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including inflation  fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates  changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs  nationalization  expropriation  limits on repatriation of funds  civil unrest  terrorism  unstable governments and legal systems  and other factors 
some of our operations are located in areas that have experienced political or economic instability  including indonesia  israel  brazil  thailand  china and south africa 
in addition  our performance depends to some extent on that of the industries we serve  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries 
our sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper companies at whose mills we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of our customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to us as those currently in effect could cause our future growth rate to differ materially from our historical growth rate  and could also result in impairment of the assets associated with the pcc plant 
there is presently one satellite location at which the contract with the host mill has expired and one location  representing less than one unit of pcc production  at which the host mill has informed us that the contract will not be renewed upon its expiration in we continue to supply pcc at both of these locations 
at the location at which the contract has expired  we hope to reach agreement on a long term extension of the contract  however  there can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful 
in addition  great northern paper  inc ceased operations at its two paper mills in millinocket and east millinocket  maine  which were served by a pcc plant operated by us 
great northern paper filed for bankruptcy protection on january   and on april  the paper mills were sold to brascan corporation  the parent company of nexfor fraser papers inc the east millinocket mill has resumed operations  and we are supplying it from other nearby pcc production facilities 
brascan has announced its intention to begin production at the millinocket mill later in where our satellite plant is located 
if the millinocket mill does not resume production  we could incur an impairment charge of approximately million 
we have a consolidated interest in two joint venture companies that operate satellite pcc plants at paper mills owned by subsidiaries of asia pulp paper company ltd 
app  one at perawang  indonesia  and one at dagang  china 
app is a multinational pulp and paper company whose current financial difficulties have been widely publicized 
while app is negotiating with its creditors  the perawang and dagang facilities have remained in operation at levels consistent with the prior year 
both mills are continuing to use our pcc and to satisfy their obligations to the joint ventures 
however  there can be no assurance that our operations at these paper mills will not be adversely affected by app s financial difficulties in the future 
our net investment in these satellite plants was approximately million at december  liquidity and capital resources cash flows in were provided from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises 
the cash was applied principally to fund million of capital expenditures and purchases of common shares for treasury 
cash provided from operating activities amounted to million in as compared with million in the reduction in cash from operations was primarily due to the ip payment of million in exchange for customer contract extensions and a technology license 
included in cash flow from operations was pension plan funding of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to utilize our cash reserves to support the aforementioned growth strategies 
on may   we acquired land and limestone ore reserves from the cushenbury mine trust for approximately million 
approximately million was paid at the closing and million was financed through an installment obligation 
the average interest rate on this obligation is approximately 
the principal payments are as follows million  million  million  million  million  million 
on february   the board authorized our management committee to repurchase  at its discretion  up to million in additional shares per year over the following three years 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately  shares under this program at an average price of approximately per share 
on october   our board of directors authorized our management committee  at its discretion  to repurchase up to million in additional shares over the next three year period 
on january   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on our common stock of per share 
the dividend is an increase from the amount we have historically paid  which had been a quarterly dividend of per share since we became a publicly owned company in october no dividend will be payable unless declared by the board and unless funds are legally available for payment thereof 
we have million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use at december  we anticipate that capital expenditures for should approximate million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet our strategic growth objectives 
we expect to meet our long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
the aggregate maturities of long term debt are as follows million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  income tax valuation allowances and litigation and environmental liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
these charges were much higher than historical levels and were primarily related to bankruptcy filings by some of our customers in the paper and steel industries and to additional provisions associated with potential risks in the paper  steel and other industries 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or increased 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer s contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
we also continue to supply pcc at one location at which the pcc contract has expired 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets charge at such facility 
in the third quarter of  we reduced the useful lives of satellite pcc plants at international paper company s ip mills due to an increased risk that some or all of these pcc contracts would not be renewed 
as a result of this change  we also reviewed the useful lives of the assets at our remaining satellite pcc facilities and other plants 
during the first quarter of  we revised the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment pertaining to our natural stone mining and processing plants and chemical processing plants from years to years and reduced the useful lives of buildings at certain satellite pcc facilities from years to years 
we also reduced the estimated useful lives of certain software related assets due to implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system 
during the second quarter of  we reached an agreement with ip that extended eight pcc supply contracts and therefore extended the useful lives of the satellite pcc plants at those ip mills 
the net effect of the changes in estimated useful lives  including the deceleration of depreciation at the ip plants  was an increase to diluted earnings per share of approximately in valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment by our ability to recover the carrying amount of the assets from expected future operating cash flow on a discounted basis 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgement regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
prospective information and factors that may affect future results the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand companies future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this report may contain forward looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  will  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
we cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions under the heading cautionary factors that may affect future results in item inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
these industries encountered difficulties in the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
for this reason  and because of the geographical diversification of our business  our operating results to date have not been materially affected by the difficult economic environment 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative effect on our financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the fasb recently indicated that they would require stock based employee compensation to be recorded as a charge to earnings beginning in we continue to monitor their progress on the issuance of this standard as well as evaluating our position with respect to current guidance 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
we had no such instruments as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant decline in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bear interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we are exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we have open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million of foreign currencies as of december  these contracts mature between january and june of the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of million 
we entered into three year interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million that expire in january these agreements effectively convert a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
the fair value of these instruments was a liability of approximately million at december
