critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts in the period in which such losses are identified 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated periodically based on the aging of accounts receivable  the financial condition of customers and their payment history  historical write off experience and other assumptions 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company assesses the inventory carrying value and reduces it if necessary to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand  and internal demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available 
the company s customer demand is highly unpredictable  and can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the company

if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in demand not meeting expectations  inventory write downs may be required 
property and depreciation property and equipment  including assets recorded under capital leases  are recorded at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives and  in the case of leasehold improvements  over the shorter of the lives of the improvements or the lease term 
the company evaluates long lived assets for recoverability  when significant changes in conditions occur  and recognizes impairment losses  if any  based upon the fair value of the assets 

table of contents goodwill the company s business acquisitions have typically resulted in goodwill  which affects the amount of possible impairment expense that the company will incur 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually in its fourth quarter and between annual tests  in certain circumstances  whenever events may indicate an impairment may have occurred 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial standards  no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities

the company has made guarantees and indemnities under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party  in relation to certain transactions  including revenue transactions in the ordinary course of business 
in connection with certain facility leases the company has indemnified its lessors for certain claims arising from the facility or the lease 
the company indemnifies its directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
however  the company has a directors and officers insurance policy that may reduce its exposure in certain circumstances and may enable it to recover a portion of future amounts that may be payable  if any 
the duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies and  in many cases is indefinite but subject to statute of limitations 
the majority of guarantees and indemnities do not provide any limitations of the maximum potential future payments the company could be obligated to make 
historically  payments related to these guarantees and indemnities have been immaterial 
the company estimates the fair value of its indemnification obligations as insignificant based on this history and insurance coverage and has  therefore  not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will not have any future financial exposure under these indemnification obligations

table of contents the das facility located in el mirage  california has been directed by california environmental agencies to investigate and take corrective action for groundwater contamination 
based upon currently available information  the company has established a provision for the cost of such investigation and corrective action 
das expects to spend approximately million for future investigation and corrective action for groundwater contamination at its el mirage location

additional risk factors the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be affected by known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
any of these risks  uncertainties and other factors could cause the company s future financial results to differ materially from recent financial results or from currently anticipated future financial results 
in addition to those noted elsewhere in this report  the company is subject to the following risks and uncertainties aerospace markets are cyclical the aerospace markets in which the company sells its products are cyclical and have experienced periodic declines 
the market for the company s products sold for new commercial aircraft production is currently experiencing a decline  the depth and duration of which is unknown 
the company s sales are  therefore  unpredictable and tend to fluctuate based on a number of factors  including economic conditions and developments affecting the aerospace industry and the customers served 
if the current downturn in commercial aircraft production were to continue for an extended period or if conditions in the commercial aircraft market were to worsen  the negative impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be further exacerbated 
commercial aircraft production rates are declining the company estimates that  in  approximately of its sales were for boeing commercial aircraft and approximately of its sales were for other commercial aircraft and miscellaneous nonaerospace commercial applications 
the production rate for new commercial aircraft is expected to decline at least through  and the timing of any rebound in new commercial aircraft production is unknown 
these reductions in commercial aircraft production are expected to affect adversely the company s result of operations and cash flows 
military and space related products are dependent upon government spending the company estimates that  in  approximately of its sales were derived from military and space markets 
these military and space markets are largely dependent upon government spending  particularly by the united states government 
changes in the levels of spending for military and space could improve or negatively impact the company s prospects in 
table of contents its military and space markets 
the tragedy involving the space shuttle columbia may further affect government spending for space programs  which could adversely affect the company 
the company is dependent on boeing commercial aircraft  the c aircraft and apache helicopter programs the company estimates that  in  approximately of its sales were for boeing commercial aircraft  of its sales were for the c aircraft  and of its sales were for the apache helicopter 
the company s sales for boeing commercial aircraft and the c aircraft are principally for new aircraft production  and the company s sales for the apache helicopter program are principally for replacement rotor blades 
any significant change in production rates for these programs would have a material effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  there is no guarantee that the company s current significant customers will continue to buy products from the company at current levels 
the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company 
for example  the company manufactures the spoilers for the boeing ng aircraft the spoilers  which contributed approximately  to sales in the company has been informed that a competitor has been awarded a contract to produce the spoilers 
although the precise timing and amount of any transition of work to the competitor is presently unknown  such a transition of work may occur as early as late terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred on september   have adversely impacted the company s operations and may do so again in the future the terrorist attacks that occurred on september  have had a negative impact on commercial air travel and  consequently  on the manufacture of commercial aircraft and the demand for the company s commercial aircraft products 
there can be no assurance that the current world political and military tensions  or the united states military actions  will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere 
these attacks may strike directly at the physical facilities of the company  its suppliers or its customers 
such attacks could have an adverse impact on the company s domestic and international sales  supply chain  production capabilities  insurance premiums or ability to purchase insurance  thereby adversely affecting the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the consequences of terrorist attacks and armed conflicts are unpredictable  and their long term effects upon the company are uncertain 
the company is experiencing competitive pricing pressures the aerospace industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures may adversely affect the company 
the company competes worldwide with a number of united states and international companies that are larger than it in terms of resources and market share 
the company is experiencing competitive pricing pressures  particularly in its ducommun aerostructures business 
these competitive pricing pressures have had  and are expected to continue to have  a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company faces risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed price contracts the company sells its products under firm  fixed price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production costs incurred by the company 
as a result  manufacturing inefficiencies  start up costs and other factors may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts 
the cost of producing products also may be adversely affected by increases 
table of contents in the cost of labor  materials  outside processing  overhead and other factors 
in many cases  the company makes multiyear firm  fixed price commitments to its customers  without assurance that the company s anticipated production costs will be achieved 
the company s products and processes are subject to risks from changes in technology the company s products and processes are subject to risks of obsolescence as a result of changes in technology 
to address this risk  the company invests in product design and development  and for capital expenditures 
there can be no guarantee that the company s product design and development efforts will be successful  or that the amounts of money required to be invested for product design and development and capital expenditures will not increase materially in the future 
the company faces risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions of businesses a key element of the company s long term strategy has been growth through acquisitions 
the company is continuously reviewing and actively pursuing acquisitions  including acquisitions outside of its current aerospace markets 
acquisitions may require the company to incur additional indebtedness  resulting in increased leverage 
any significant acquisition may result in a material weakening of the company s financial position and a material increase in the company s cost of borrowings 
acquisitions also may require the company to issue additional equity  resulting in dilution to existing stockholders 
this additional financing for acquisitions and capital expenditures may not be available on terms acceptable or favorable to the company 
acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated results  and could result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company also periodically reviews its existing businesses to determine if they are consistent with the company s strategy 
the company has sold  and may sell in the future  business units and product lines  which may result in either a gain or loss on disposition 
the company s acquisition strategy exposes it to risks  including the risk that the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses 
the company s ability to grow by acquisition is dependent upon  among other factors  the availability of suitable acquisition candidates 
growth by acquisition involves risks that could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results  including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  the potential amortization of acquired intangible assets  the potential impairment of goodwill and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
the company may not be able to consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or  if any acquisitions are consummated  to satisfactorily integrate these acquired businesses 
goodwill could be impaired in the future in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill at december   management was required to make certain critical estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  with respect to the company s ducommun aerostructures  inc das  reporting unit  included that during the next several years das will make improvements in manufacturing efficiency  achieve reductions in operating costs  and obtain increases in sales and backlog 
if any of these or other estimates and assumptions are not realized in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge for the goodwill of das 
the goodwill of das was  at december  
table of contents significant consolidation in the aerospace industry could adversely affect the company s business and financial results the aerospace industry is experiencing significant consolidation  including among the company s customers  competitors and suppliers 
consolidation among the company s customers may result in delays in the award of new contracts and losses of existing business 
consolidation among the company s competitors may result in larger competitors with greater resources and market share  which could adversely affect the company s ability to compete successfully 
consolidation among the company s suppliers may result in fewer sources of supply and increased cost to the company 
the company s manufacturing operations may be adversely affected by the availability of raw materials and components from suppliers in some cases  the company s customers supply raw materials and components to the company 
in other cases  the company s customers designate specific suppliers from which the company is directed to purchase raw materials and components 
as a result  the company may have limited control over the selection of suppliers and the timing of receipt and cost of raw materials and components from suppliers 
the failure of customers and suppliers to deliver on a timely basis raw materials and components to the company may adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows 
environmental liabilities could adversely affect the company s financial results the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations 
the company is investigating and taking corrective action for groundwater contamination at its das subsidiary s el mirage  california site 
the company is also a potentially responsible party at certain sites at which it previously disposed of hazardous wastes 
there can be no assurance that future developments  lawsuits and administrative actions  and liabilities relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the das chemical milling business uses various acid and alkaline solutions in the chemical milling process  resulting in potential environmental hazards 
despite existing waste recovery systems and continuing capital expenditures for waste reduction and management  at least for the immediate future  this business will remain dependent on the availability and cost of remote hazardous waste disposal sites or other alternative methods of disposal 
the das facility located in el mirage  california has been directed by california environmental agencies to investigate and take corrective action for groundwater contamination 
based upon currently available information  the company has established a provision for the cost of such investigation and corrective action
