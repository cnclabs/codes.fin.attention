manufacturer services manufacturer services serves the needs of domestic consumer product manufacturers  primarily within the consumer packaged goods industry 
using the catalina marketing network  this operating segment specializes in behavior based marketing communications that are delivered at the point of sale 
the primary service line of the catalina marketing network is the in store delivery of incentives at the checkout lane of a retailer  typically a supermarket 
catalina marketing links its proprietary software  computers  central databases and thermal printers with a retailer s point of sale controller and scanning equipment 
the network prints customized promotions at the point of sale based on product universal product codes or other scanned information 
the printed promotions are handed to consumers by the cashier at the end of the shopping transaction 
our clients contract with us to deliver promotions for them and typically pay us a fee for each promotion delivered 
the primary focus of manufacturer services sales efforts is assisting consumer packaged goods manufacturers to design programs that deliver results that achieve their brand objectives 
our sales and client service teams consult with current and prospective clients to develop and implement customized  targeted marketing programs that meet specific brand strategies and objectives 

table of contents manufacturer services generates revenue primarily by providing in store  electronic marketing delivery services via the catalina marketing network 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total incentives delivered multiplied by a per print fee 
delivered incentives include targeted promotions  messages and sweepstakes 
the company generally bills its clients a minimum category fee in advance of the actual delivery 
contracts for delivery include a minimum number of targeted promotions or messages for a specified category  or categories  within a four week period referred to as a cycle 
the delivery of messages or promotions is based upon particular triggering transactions that are registered at the point of sale ie  the checkout counter of a retail store 
in general  manufacturer services recognizes revenue at the time a promotion is delivered at the checkout counter of the retail store based on a per promotion charge 
the majority of our contracts cover multiple cycles 
redemption of these promotions is similar to that of traditional manufacturer coupons 
in this regard  retailers provide discounts to consumers who present the coupons 
the retailers send redeemed coupons to clearinghouses and receive reimbursements for the discounts provided  including handling fees  from the manufacturers 
the two primary programs of manufacturer services are checkout coupon and checkout direct 
through its checkout coupon service  catalina marketing delivers marketing communications to consumers at checkout  based on the products included in their current shopping basket 
through its checkout direct service  catalina marketing delivers marketing communications to consumers at the checkout counter using past purchase behavior  which is collected using frequent shopper or similar consumer identification methods 
manufacturer services had a single client  nestl  that accounted for approximately  and of revenues generated by this segment for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we believe that the loss of nestl could have a material adverse effect on manufacturer services as well as the company taken as a whole 
retail services retail services provides innovative marketing solutions to approximately retail chains nationwide 
the primary objective of this operating group is to support  maintain and expand the catalina marketing network used by manufacturer services 
in addition  this operating group provides services to retailers  including promotional prints and analytical services that enable retailers to focus on changing consumer shopping patterns with targeted communications  motivate the consumers to visit a retailer more frequently  increase the size of purchase transactions  purchase specific products and develop brand loyalty 
on march   we sold our loyalty card and data entry services business 
this business represented less than of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year see significant business developments and events through march  the company typically enters into agreements with retail chains to install its network in the retail stores of the chain for an initial specified period 
generally  the retailer pays a one time fee as a partial reimbursement for the cost of the installation 
in general  the company pays distribution fees to  and exchanges services with  the retailer based on the number of promotions printed 
because of the concentration of ownership in the retail grocery industry  we are dependent on a limited number of retailers that supply the points of distribution for our manufacturer clients printed promotional materials 
approximately of the printed in store promotional incentives we provided for our clients during the fiscal year ended march   were generated from within the stores belonging to five retail chains 
if any of these retail chains were to decide to not renew their contract with us to provide our services  or if they materially reduce the number of point of sale locations included on our network  a material reduction in our revenues could result if we were unable to replace these point of sale locations 
the company owns the equipment installed in each retail store  including a thermal printer at each checkout lane linked by a computer on the retailer s premises to the retailer s point of sale controller and scanning equipment 
the company operates two data processing facilities in the united states that employ various technologies to transmit promotional instructions to computers installed in retail stores and retrieve 
table of contents program data 
all of the equipment and supplies  including computers  printers and paper  used in a retail installation  are purchased by the company from outside sources 
the store equipment and supplies used by our network generally are managed  installed and maintained by our corporate support staff for all of our operating segments 
however  we outsource certain aspects of the installation of our network in retail locations related to wiring and connection of equipment to third party contractors 
while we currently use a limited number of primary suppliers  the company believes that alternate sources of supply are available without material interruption to the company s business 
chr chr services assist pharmaceutical products and consumer packaged goods manufacturers  as well as retail pharmacies  in providing consumers with condition specific health information and direct to patient communications 
chr s programs and services enable the company s clients to acquire and retain patients by providing educational information about their treatment along with the benefits of compliance  and by encouraging dialogue between patients and their healthcare professionals 
chr s primary product offerings employ an in store  prescription information based technology to provide targeted  direct to patient communications on behalf of the company s clients 
these communication services include messages and educational information to healthcare patients at pharmacies throughout the health resource network 
the health resource network utilizes a proprietary software system that gives pharmaceutical manufacturers and retailers the opportunity to effectively communicate with patients based on their prescription buying behavior and assists patients in making more informed healthcare decisions while preserving their privacy 
chr primarily generates revenues by printing messages for pharmaceutical manufacturers and consumer packaged goods manufacturers in the health resource newsletter  chr s primary client offering 
distribution of the newsletter is generated by the national drug code found on all prescription drugs and can be targeted to the consumer based on a variety of factors which could include the national drug code  age  gender  third party payer  category or whether the medicine is prescribed for the first time or a refill  but not by name  address or other personally identifiable information 
when a prescription is processed via the health resource network  a customized newsletter with prescription information  therapeutically relevant editorial content and product information  is printed in the pharmacy and given to a consumer by their pharmacist along with that consumer s medication 
chr enters into agreements with pharmacy retail chains to install the health resource network in pharmacies within the chain 
upon installation  the retailer generally agrees to use the health resource network in its pharmacy for a minimum period of time 
chr pays distribution fees to  and exchanges services with  the pharmacy based on the number of health resource newsletters printed 
approximately of the newsletters printed during the fiscal year ended march   were generated from within the stores belonging to five retail pharmacy chains 
if any of these retail pharmacy chains were to decide to not renew their contract with us  or if they materially reduce the number of pharmacy locations included on our network  a material reduction in chr s revenues could result if we were unable to either replace these pharmacy locations or the number of transactions processed by the retail pharmacy chain 
the health resource network uses a printer linked by an on premises computer to the pharmacy s point of sale controller 
certain versions of the software eliminate the need for a computer in each location  in which case only a printer is located in those pharmacies 
chr operates a data processing facility that communicates via various technologies with the computers installed in the pharmacies to send promotional instructions and retrieve program data 
in some cases  chr installs and owns the equipment 
in other cases  the equipment is owned by the pharmacy retailer 
all of the equipment owned by us is generic and purchased from third party vendors 
typically  pharmacies are contractually obligated to provide supplies  including toner and paper 
the company believes that we can secure alternate sources of equipment and supplies without significant interruption to chr s business 

table of contents chr s client base varies from year to year and as such a client may be significant in one year and not in another 
chr s top five clients accounted for  and of chr s revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively

international had a single client that accounted for approximately  and of revenues generated by this segment for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we believe that the loss of this client could have a material adverse effect on this business segment  but not on the company taken as a whole 
in fiscal year  international revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
our international operations are subject to the normal risks of foreign operations  including changes in local business and economic conditions  political uncertainties  adapting to different regulatory requirements  interest rate movements  uncertainties of litigation  increasing consolidation of retailers and consumer packaged goods manufacturers  competition  pricing pressure  seasonality and changing customer and client preferences 
certain of these risks have affected our business in the past and may also have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition in the future 
in addition  sales in our international operations are billed in foreign currencies and are subject to currency exchange fluctuations as are intercompany royalties and financing activities 
in prior years  changes in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies have had an impact on our revenues and margins 
we cannot predict the direction or magnitude of currency fluctuations 
the company  where practical  purchases goods and services in local currencies 
the company borrows locally to meet its financing requirements in japan to obtain certain natural and economic hedges 
in all jurisdictions in which we operate  we are also subject to the laws and regulations that govern foreign investment  foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 
these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 
operations designated to be divested by the company in november  the company announced its intention to divest dms  cmrs and japan billboard  all of which were determined not to be strategically aligned with the company s current core competencies 
aggregate revenues generated by dms  cmrs and japan billboard accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 

table of contents although the company intends to divest these business segments  the results of operations for these segments are reflected as continuing operations in our consolidated financial statements

in addition  dms had another client that accounted for  and of revenues generated by this segment for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we believe that the loss of this client could have a material adverse effect on dms  but not on the business of the company taken as a whole

in addition  cmrs had another client that accounted for approximately  and of revenues generated by this segment for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we believe that the loss of either of these clients could have a material adverse effect on cmrs  but not on the business of the company taken as a whole 
japan billboard japan billboard  also referred to as pmkk  is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that operates a billboard and outdoor media business in japan 
japan billboard primarily owns and rents billboards which are displayed on rooftops or faces of buildings in locations suitable for advertising 
advertising is sold either directly to a broad range of leading clients across multiple industries or through advertising agencies 
in general  billboards are designed by and produced under the supervision of japan billboard 
upon completion and installation  the billboards are financed through third party financing companies 
japan billboard is required to make rental payments to building owners for the space on the rooftops and faces of buildings where 
table of contents the billboards are installed 
japan billboard provides the maintenance for their billboards during the life of the contract  which generally ranges from three to five years 
japan billboard had a client that accounted for approximately  and of revenues generated by this segment for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
this client produces tobacco products and is subject to the rules and regulations that govern that industry 
as discussed below  this client has substantially reduced its spending with japan billboard and this has had a material adverse effect on japan billboard  but not the business of the company taken as a whole 
the passage and implementation of the voluntary global tobacco marketing initiative the initiative in fiscal year has significantly affected the manner in which tobacco companies in japan are permitted to market  promote and advertise its products 
as a result of the implementation of this initiative  japan billboard s primary client began to reduce their advertising expenditures for billboards significantly  as well as other media and promotional spending 
the initiative  as it relates to outdoor tobacco advertising  mandates that the maximum visual dimension of any billboard advertisement be limited to square meters 
as a result  a significant number of japan billboard s sales contracts covering a broad network of large sized billboards with this client were either terminated or not renewed 
in those cases  japan billboard has actively sought replacement business to forestall the significant cost of sign removal and cultivate new revenue streams 
in january  japan s ministry of health announced its intention to sign and ratify the international framework convention on tobacco control recently adopted by the world health organization 
this convention will become effective once it has been adopted by countries 
the adoption of this convention will further limit tobacco companies ability to advertise tobacco products on billboards in japan 
the effects of this ruling are significant to japan billboard  and the company expects a further reduction in revenues from its single significant client 
competition competition in the targeted marketing services business is intense and includes many competitors 
we compete for manufacturer advertising and consumer promotion budgets with a wide range of alternative media including television  radio  print and direct mail advertising  as well as several alternative in store and point of sale programs 
the company s segments  manufacturer services  retail services  dms and international  compete with various traditional coupon delivery methods including free standing inserts  newspapers  direct mail  magazines and in or on product packaging  as well as other in store marketing companies that use a variety of coupon  promotion or other advertising delivery methods 
in addition  the company could experience increased competition  both internationally and domestically  from changes and advances in technology including from retailer point of sale pos systems 
furthermore  as sales of certain grocery products  particularly in specialized categories such as paper  baby and pet products  shift from traditional grocery sales retailers to mass merchandisers and value chains  the company s ability to reach shoppers through the existing retail network of traditional grocery stores may be impacted in these specified product categories 
chr competes for pharmaceutical budget dollars with a wide range of media  including television  publications  direct mail and other alternate sources of direct to consumer communication 
competition for cmrs comes from a broad array of national  regional and local marketing research firms 
the company competes for advertising  promotional and research dollars based on the efficiencies afforded by a unique kind of targeting based on consumer shopping behavior  called behavior based marketing 
behavior based marketing requires an efficient network of retail point of sale systems and proprietary software and database systems which target individual consumers based on shopping behavior exhibited at the point of sale 
our competitive advantages in the practice of behavior based marketing are achieved through the number of shoppers reached through the company s retail network  the number of household ids and associated purchase histories available in the database and the company s ability to deliver consumer insights and influence consumer buying behavior 

table of contents research and development the company s research and development efforts are generally for pilot project execution to create  test and support new applications for the catalina marketing network and health resource network  market research  software development and system upgrades 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  expenditures for research and development were million  million and million  respectively 
intellectual property the company currently holds  and has pending  numerous united states and foreign patents relating to catalina marketing products and services 
these patents include the initial targeted incentive core patents as well as improvements and additional inventions related to the company s current and contemplated business  programs and services 
in addition  the company regards certain computer software in the catalina marketing network and each additional service application as proprietary and subject to copyright protection 
the company also holds  and has pending  numerous service marks and trademarks related to its entities  businesses  products and services that have associated goodwill in the relevant marketplace 
the company believes that certain intellectual property owned or licensed by the company gives us a competitive advantage in key geographic regions in which we operate 
while we continue to pursue protection for intellectual property rights developed by the company  certain of our patents  over time  will expire and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional patent rights 
the expiration of a core patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge may result in significant competition from third parties with respect to the covered product or service in a short period of time 
the actual protection afforded by a patent  which can vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent  the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the relevant country 
although we believe that the company s intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage  we believe that we are not dependent upon a single patent  or a specific series of patents  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in appropriate situations  we seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights vigorously 
government regulation our operations are subject to regulation in the united states and in other countries in which we do business 
generally  we are subject to federal and state laws governing the privacy and the use of consumer information collected by us 
in the united states  various federal agencies including the federal trade commission  the department of treasury s alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau  and various state agencies have promulgated regulations that restrict the advertising of tobacco  dairy and alcohol beverage products 
these regulations include below cost  tied house and trade practice regulations which vary from state to state and can restrict a manufacturer and or a retailer s ability to issue coupons for tobacco  dairy and alcohol beverage products 
other state and federal laws also restrict the content and sponsorship of regulated product coupons and messages 
chr operates in a highly regulated business environment 
the united states food and drug administration of the department of health and human services hhs regulates the form and content of prescription drug promotions  such as the messaging in the health resource newsletter 
in addition  federal medical privacy regulations  administered by the office of civil rights of hhs  affect the ability of chr and its retail pharmacy partners to use patient specific pharmacy information to provide customized health resource newsletters 
some states have adopted  or are considering adopting  state medical privacy requirements that could be interpreted more stringently than federal medical privacy requirements 
federal antikickback requirements  administered by the hhs office of the inspector general  could be interpreted as restricting drug manufacturer sponsored programs such as the health resource newsletter 
state antikickback and consumer protection statutes could also be interpreted to impose similar restrictions

delay in filing our annual report and quarterly financial results for the fiscal year ended march  in june  we announced our intent to delay the filing of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  the company was unable to file its quarterly report on form q for the quarters ended december   september  and june   in a timely manner 
as required  catalina filed notifications of late filing with the sec under rule b for these filings 
the filing of this annual report on form k for fiscal year was delayed because we were required to devote significant time and resources to file our annual report on form k for fiscal year  which was filed on may  we expect to file our quarterly report on form q for the quarters ended december   september  and june  for fiscal year as soon as practicable 
the delay in filing this annual report on form k for fiscal year and our quarterly report on form q for fiscal year  has not had an impact on our current credit facilities and the company is currently in compliance with all related financial covenants 
consolidated results of operations the following table includes the revenues  operating profit loss and net income loss for each of the company s significant reportable segments for the fiscal years ended march   and the accounts of our wholly and majority owned foreign subsidiaries are included for the twelve months ended december  which is their fiscal year end 
in general  we expect our revenues to be greater during periods of higher promotional activity by manufacturers 
the pattern of promotion distribution is irregular and may change from period to period depending on various factors  including the economy  competition  the timing of new product introductions and the timing of manufacturers promotion planning and implementation 
in addition  this pattern may be affected by seasonal factors such as holiday related promotion  seasonal product advertising and annual budgeting processes affecting when our clients use promotional and consumer related expenditure budgets 
the seasonality of our international operations may be different than that of our domestic operations for many reasons  but the impact of seasonality on our reporting may also be affected by the difference in fiscal years 
these factors  as well as the overall growth in the number of retailer and manufacturer contracts with the company  the timing of growth of the installed store base and access to revenue producing transactions  may impact our revenues and profits in any particular period

revenues fiscal year consolidated revenues of million were relatively unchanged compared with fiscal year revenues of million 
international revenues grew million  or  year over year primarily from an increase in the volume of promotions delivered 
chr revenues grew million  or  year over year primarily due to the recognition of revenues deferred in prior years and by an increase in the number of revenue producing newsletters printed at participating pharmacies in the health resource network 
these increases were offset almost entirely by a million decline in revenues at dms  a million dollar reduction in revenues from japan billboard  a million reduction in revenues from promotions printed in manufacturer services  and a net million decline from our other revenue generating activities comprised predominantly of retail services and cmrs 
in fiscal year  consolidated revenues totaled million  an increase of over fiscal year of million 
as described more fully in the segment discussion below  fiscal year revenue growth was driven by dms  international and retail services  which offset revenue declines in manufacturer services  chr and japan billboard 
cost and expenses for fiscal year  consolidated direct operating expenses of million declined by from the fiscal year total of million 
direct operating expenses consist of retailer fees  paper  sales commissions  loyalty and direct mail marketing expenses  provision for doubtful accounts  the expenses of operating and maintaining the catalina marketing and health resource networks and the direct expenses associated with japan billboard 
as a percentage of revenues  direct operating expenses were in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year the most significant decreases in consolidated direct 
table of contents operating expenses related to a reduction in third party costs incurred for product mailings in dms  costs directly associated with loyalty card sales  billboard maintenance expenses  and sales commissions directly related to a decrease in revenues 
chr contributed to the reduction in direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily due to a reduction in retailer fees and store related expenses 
these cost declines primarily resulted from renegotiated contracts with key retail pharmacy chains and an overall reduction in chr s field operations personnel enabled by restructuring and efficiencies achieved by consolidating certain processes with corporate 
these cost reductions were offset in part by an increase in store related costs due to an increase in the number of international stores and technological development expenses 
consolidated direct operating expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year direct operating expenses were of revenues in fiscal year  compared with of revenues in fiscal year the dollar increase was primarily the result of increased third party costs for product mailings at dms 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in direct operating expenses in japan billboard

as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses in fiscal year increased to of revenues from of revenues in fiscal year the largest net increase in dollars and percent of revenue was the result of an increase of approximately million of legal  accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the filing our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march   the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal years and  shareholder litigation and internal investigations 
these additional expenses are expected to continue into fiscal year the increase in sg a is also attributable to a million increase relating to the sales force in our international segment 
sg a expenses were million in fiscal year  an increase of approximately over fiscal year sg a expenses of million 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase was due to a increase in personnel costs resulting from an increase in our sales force and a increase in information technology costs 
as previously disclosed  the company announced its intent to divest dms  cmrs and japan billboard because they were determined not to be strategically aligned with the company s current core competencies 
during fiscal year  the company tested the recorded goodwill related to these operations for impairment in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 

our goodwill impairment testing was performed by comparing estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting units 
fair value was estimated using forecasted future cash flows  discounted using risk adjusted interest rates 
based on this testing  we recorded impairment charges related to goodwill of million in fiscal year of this amount  million related to dms  million related to cmrs and related to japan billboard 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the above calculations are based on management s judgments and estimates 
a detailed discussion on management s accounting policies for estimating impairment can be found in critical accounting estimates below 
we also recognized impairment charges of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  due to impairment of certain billboard fixed assets at our japan billboard business 
see discussion in segment results japan billboard 
fiscal year consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of million increased  or million  from fiscal year expense of million 
this increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of additional capital expenditures for store equipment in international and information technology equipment in fiscal year and the depreciation of asset retirement obligation costs recorded in fiscal year 
table of contents depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal year  up from fiscal year depreciation and amortization expense of million 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily the result of additional capital expenditures for store equipment and information technology equipment in fiscal years through interest expense consolidated interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year resulted from million of amortization of financing fees  higher interest rates and an increase in our unused facility fees offset in part by lower average debt balances outstanding 
interest and unused facility fee rate increases were primarily related to amended provisions in our credit facilities as a result of the company s delay in filing its financial statements 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year resulted from lower average debt balances outstanding and lower interest rates 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our credit facilities 
income tax provision although the company recognized pre tax income of million in fiscal  we recognized tax expense of million 
this was primarily due to the effect of nondeductible goodwill impairment charges of million which were not eligible for a tax benefit 
to a lesser extent  an increase in the valuation reserve for deferred tax assets and foreign taxes caused the company s effective tax rate to be higher than the federal statutory rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated provision for income taxes for fiscal year of million increased to of income before taxes and minority interest compared with million or of income before income taxes for fiscal year the rate change was primarily due to an increase in the company s reserve for certain state income tax matters deemed reasonably estimable and probable and to the change in the sales mix between domestic  state and foreign operations 
to a lesser extent  the rate increased as a result of the decrease in post acquisition earnout payments that are deductible as original issue discount payments for tax purposes 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal year was higher than the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign income taxes and the effect of various nondeductible expenses 
segment results manufacturer services manufacturer services serves the needs of domestic consumer product manufacturers  primarily within the consumer packaged goods industry 
using the catalina marketing network  this operating segment specializes in behavior based marketing communications that are delivered at the point of sale 
the primary service line of the catalina marketing network is the in store delivery of incentives at the checkout lane of a retailer  typically a supermarket 
catalina marketing links its proprietary software  computers  central databases and thermal printers with a retailer s point of sale controllers and scanners 
the network prints customized promotions at the point of sale based on universal product codes or other scanned information 
the printed promotions are handed to consumers by the cashier at the end of the shopping transaction 
manufacturer services clients contract with us to deliver promotions for them and typically pay us a fee for each promotion delivered 
in general  manufacturer services recognizes revenue at the time a promotion is delivered at the checkout counter of the retail store based on a per promotion charge 
we had one client that individually accounted for more than ten percent of revenues of manufacturer services for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  we had another significant client that accounted for  and of revenues generated by this segment for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
this other client has notified us that  beginning in fiscal year  it does not intend to purchase our services at the levels it had spent with us in prior years 
at this time  we cannot determine the impact of this spending reduction on our revenues 
we will attempt to sell the product 
table of contents categories and cycles previously purchased by this client to other cpg manufacturers  but we cannot provide assurance that this will occur 
if we are unable to replace those revenues  the reduction in business with this client may have a material adverse effect on manufacturer services 
year ended march  compared with year ended march  revenues were million in fiscal year  down from revenues of million in fiscal year  primarily due to a reduction in the volume of promotions printed 
this decrease in promotions printed was primarily attributable to a decline in cpg manufacturers spending with us in certain product categories 
in the united states  the catalina marketing network was installed in approximately  stores at march  and reached approximately million shoppers each week as compared with approximately  stores and million shoppers each week at march  in fiscal year  the company added approximately net of deinstallations stores to the catalina marketing network in the united states  compared with approximately  net of deinstallations stores in fiscal year deinstallation activity can and does occur primarily due to the consolidation and business combination of supermarket chains as well as store closures made by retailers in the ordinary course of business 
the pace of installations varies depending on the timing of contracts entered into with retailers and the scheduling of store installations by mutual agreement 
maintaining our retail store base is critical to manufacturer services as well as the company 
the loss of any of the major retail chains from our network could have a material adverse effect on manufacturer services as well as the company 
operating profit was million in fiscal year  down from operating profit of million in fiscal year the decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the decrease in revenues described above  as well as an increase in certain operating costs 
direct operating expenses increased million in fiscal year  or over fiscal year  primarily due to a change in the manner in which the company allocates certain retailer costs 
beginning in fiscal year  manufacturer services absorbed approximately million of costs from retail services as compensation for intersegment services provided 
this increase in expenses was offset primarily by approximately a million reduction in allocated corporate charges due to lower store related expenses and approximately a million decline in sales commissions 
operating profit also declined due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  or over fiscal year this increase was attributable to a revised corporate allocation methodology  as well as an increase in consolidated corporate depreciation and amortization costs 
total fiscal year sg a expenses of million remained relatively comparable with fiscal year sg a expenses of million 
net income was million in fiscal year  down from net income of million in fiscal year the decrease in net income was due primarily to the decrease in operating profit discussed above

chr chr services allow pharmaceutical and cpg manufacturers  as well as retail pharmacies  to provide consumers with condition specific health information and direct to patient communications 
chr s programs and services give its clients the ability to acquire and retain patients by providing educational information about their treatment along with the benefits of compliance  and by encouraging dialogue between patients and their health care professionals 
chr s primary service offerings use in store  prescription based technology to provide targeted  direct to patient communications on behalf of its clients 
these communication services include messages and educational information to healthcare patients at pharmacies throughout the health resource network 
the health resource network is a proprietary software system that gives pharmaceutical and cpg manufacturers and retailers the opportunity to effectively communicate with patients based on their prescription buying behavior and assists patients in making more informed healthcare decisions while preserving their privacy 
chr primarily generates revenues by printing messages for pharmaceutical and cpg manufacturers in the health resource newsletter 
when a prescription is processed via the health resource network  a customized newsletter with prescription information  therapeutically relevant editorial content and product information is printed in the pharmacy and given to consumers by their pharmacist when they get their medication 
these newsletters are generated for the pharmacy s customer when a prescription is purchased based on the particular drug s national drug code symbol 
the message provides relevant information on prescription medications or other products in the retail store 
year ended march  compared with year ended march  revenues were million in fiscal year  up from revenues of million in fiscal year the increase in revenues was due in part to the recognition of approximately million in revenue deferred from prior years 
such revenue was not recognized by chr prior to fiscal year because it did not meet the necessary revenue recognition criteria 
in addition  revenues increased approximately million due to the delivery of additional revenue generating newsletters driven by an increase in pharmaceutical manufacturer spending in our health resource network 
the health resource network was installed in approximately  pharmacies at march   as compared with approximately  pharmacies at march  the company deinstalled its health resource network in approximately  pharmacies  net of installations  in fiscal year as compared with approximately net installations of pharmacies in fiscal year chr printed approximately billion newsletters during fiscal year in its retail pharmacy chains compared with approximately million newsletters during fiscal year  an increase of 
in fiscal year  the health resource network was deinstalled in two retail pharmacy chains  eckerd and cvs  which represented approximately  stores in the health resource network 
revenues generated from newsletters delivered at eckerd and cvs were approximately million  or  of total chr revenue in fiscal year and million  or  of total chr revenue in fiscal year at june   the health resource network was installed in approximately  pharmacy outlets 
at this time  we cannot determine the impact this reduction in stores will have on our revenues 
we will attempt to expand our access to prescription transactions at retail pharmacies both through organic growth of our current retail pharmacy chains and the addition of new retail pharmacy chains to the health resource network  but we cannot provide assurance that this will occur 
maintaining and growing our retail pharmacy base  as well as access to revenue generating prescription transactions  is critical to chr as the size and capabilities of our network provide us with a substantial competitive advantage in the industry

table of contents operating loss was million in fiscal year  down from an operating profit of million in fiscal year in addition to the decline in revenues described above  the decrease in operating profit was primarily the result of a million goodwill impairment charge as previously discussed in consolidated results of operations

net income of million in fiscal year was unchanged as compared with fiscal year japan billboard japan billboard  also referred to herein as pmkk  is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that operates a billboard and outdoor media business in japan 
japan billboard primarily owns and rents billboards which are displayed on rooftops or faces of buildings in locations suitable for advertising 
advertising is sold either directly to a broad range of leading clients across multiple industries or through advertising agencies 
in general  billboards are designed by and produced under the supervision of japan billboard 
upon completion and installation  the billboards are financed through third party financing companies 
japan billboard is required to make rental payments to building owners for space on the rooftops and faces of buildings where the billboards are installed 
japan billboard provides the maintenance for their billboards during the life of the contracts which generally range from three to six years 
in may  the company  through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries  exercised a call option contained in the purchase agreement dated october   among the company  pmkk and certain minority shareholders of pmkk  to purchase the remaining of the voting equity interest in pmkk held by certain minority shareholders for an aggregate purchase price equal to million in cash  based on foreign currency exchange rates at the payment date in july the company exercised the call option to reduce the adverse financial impact that would have resulted from the exercise of a put option available to the minority shareholders 
pmkk is now wholly owned by the company 
the purchase price was based on a pre determined formula of enterprise value based on pmkk s performance during the previous four quarters 
subsequently  we determined that the carrying value of the japan billboard business had been impaired primarily because the purchase price paid under the predetermined formula described above was in excess of the fair value of the japan billboard business 
in addition  the voluntary global tobacco marketing initiative  described below  has had a significant negative impact on the japan billboard business 
the passage and adoption of the voluntary global tobacco marketing initiative the initiative in fiscal year has significantly affected the manner in which tobacco companies in japan can market  promote and advertise their products 
as a result of the implementation of this initiative  japan billboard s primary client began to reduce their advertising expenditures for billboards significantly  as well as most other media and promotional spending 
the initiative  as it relates to outdoor advertising  mandated that the maximum visual dimension of any billboard advertisement be limited to square meters 
as a result  a significant number of japan billboard s sales contracts covering a broad network of large sized billboards with this client were either terminated or not renewed 
in those cases  japan billboard has actively sought replacement business to both forestall the significant cost of sign removal and begin cultivating new revenues 

table of contents as a result of the initiative  japan billboard recognized charges to earnings of million in fiscal year as a result of the early retirement of several billboards 
in january  japan s ministry of health announced its intention to sign and ratify its involvement in the world health organization s recently adopted international framework convention on tobacco control fctc that will come into effect when countries have signed 
the adoption of fctc will limit the ability of tobacco companies to advertise tobacco products on billboards in japan 
the effects of fctc are significant to japan billboard and the company expects a further reduction in revenues from pmkk s clients 
as a result of this information  the company has performed impairment testing pursuant to sfas no 
and sfas no 
additionally  the company has calculated the effect of the retirement obligation pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

as a result  in fiscal year  the company recognized a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill and a charge of million related to the impairment of long lived assets and non recoverable asset retirement costs 
during fiscal year  the company announced its intention to divest the japan billboard business 
year ended march  compared with year ended march  revenues were million in fiscal year  down compared with revenues of million in fiscal year the decrease in revenues was due mainly to a continued reduction in spending from one tobacco producing client related to the initiative 
operating loss was million in fiscal year  a million decline from an operating profit of million in fiscal year in addition to the decline in revenues described above  the decrease in operating results was primarily the result of a million goodwill impairment charge  a million billboard asset impairment charge and a million increase in depreciation expense due to the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
to record disposal and retirement obligations on its long lived billboard assets 
the reduction in revenue was offset in part by a million  or  reduction in operating expenses associated with fewer billboards 
net loss was million in fiscal year  as compared with net income of million in fiscal year the decrease in net income was due mainly to the decrease in operating profit discussed above and  to a lesser extent  a million increase in the tax provision associated primarily with the recording of a valuation allowance on the segment s net deferred tax assets 
year ended march  compared with year ended march  revenues were million in fiscal year  down from revenues of million in fiscal year the decrease in revenues was due mainly to a decline in tobacco advertising spending related to the initiative which mandated full compliance by december  in japan 
operating profit was million in fiscal year  down from an operating profit of million in fiscal year the decrease in operating profit was due mainly to a decline in the high margin revenues from tobacco clients  along with an increase in costs primarily associated with impairment charges and operating expenses recognized as a result of the early retirement of several billboards due to the initiative 
net income was million in fiscal year  down from net income of million in fiscal year the decrease in net income was due mainly to a decline in the high margin tobacco revenues  along with an increase in depreciation costs primarily associated with the premature take downs of terminated tobacco billboards 
foreign currency translation and its effect on revenues our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were million  which includes million from our foreign operations 
the local currencies of the countries in which we maintain foreign operations are the euro  british pound sterling and japanese yen 
these currencies strengthened against the united states dollar during our fiscal year ended accordingly  revenues in united states dollars for our foreign operations would have been 
table of contents lower for the fiscal year  if translated using the weighted average currency translation rates for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operations  a credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks with a revolving loan credit facility of up to million corporate facility  various credit agreements entered into by our japan subsidiary japan credit facilities and the indebtedness under a lease arrangement in the amount of million

cash on hand as of march  was million 
of the total amount on hand  approximately million is inaccessible without additional costs due to foreign repatriation restrictions 
we have no significant long term debt other than outstanding installment payables in japan and the indebtedness under the lease agreement governing our headquarters facility 
we will continue to invest in sales and marketing  in our catalina marketing network and in other support technology and enhanced systems of reporting and controls

our existing cash and cash equivalents  combined with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facilities  should be sufficient to fund our operating activities as well as other opportunities for the short term and over our forecasted long range plan of three years 
if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations  raising additional capital when required  or being able to borrow in sufficient amounts  our business could suffer

although we believe that cash generated from operations under economic conditions similar to those currently existing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements  failure to renegotiate the terms of or to replace the corporate facility on terms that are at least as favorable to us could have  in conjunction with other unknown events related to our liquidity or future business prospects  a material adverse effect on our ability to provide sufficient cash to fund our operations

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures 
the company s primary capital expenditures are for store equipment and third party store installation and upgrade costs  as well as data processing equipment for the company s central data processing facilities 
total store equipment and third party store installation costs for the catalina marketing network range from  to  per store 
capital expenditures were million for the year ended march  compared with million for the year ended march  capital expenditures were lower in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year because of fewer installations of retail point of sale equipment and lower expenditures for information technology primarily due to an initiative to reduce spending for our domestic operations in fiscal year the pace of installations varies depending on the timing of contracts entered into with retailers and the scheduling of store installations by mutual agreement 
we typically finance our capital expenditures for in store equipment with cash generated from operations 
because in store installations do not follow a pattern that necessarily coincides with our operating cash flows  we may finance our capital expenditures for this equipment with proceeds from our corporate facility 
commitments for purchases of in store equipment as of march  totaled million  which includes a commitment of million for the purchase of paper supplies 
contingent earnout payment 
in  the company  through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries  executed a final deferred contingency earnout agreement with the previous minority partners of the catalina marketing japan coupon business 
the contingency stipulates a potential earn out payment based on a predetermined formula over the applicable four consecutive quarters of earnings during a time period ending between and the company is not able to estimate the amount of this contingent payment which is based on future earnings  however  the ultimate amount of this payment  if any  could be material 
sales tax assessment a sales and use tax audit for the period january  to june  was conducted by a state taxing authority resulting in an assessment of sales tax on the company s revenue generated from its electronic marketing delivery service conducted within that state 
the company subsequently appealed this assessment to the relevant state tax tribunal 
the tax tribunal held that the electronic marketing delivery activities of the company were taxable in their entirety 
in march  the state s intermediate court of appeals affirmed the decision of the tax tribunal 
the company appealed the case to the state s supreme court and  in may  the state supreme court vacated the prior decision  remanded the case back to the tax tribunal and directed the tax tribunal to apply a different legal test 
the company does not yet know the final outcome of the case 
if an adverse decision is reached in this case  the company does not believe that the tax assessment will be material to the company  however  the company may become subject to similar proceedings in other jurisdictions and additional tax assessments resulting from those proceedings could be material to the company 
critical accounting estimates the company has identified certain financial areas that require estimates and judgments  such that  if these estimates and judgments were to change  results of operations could materially differ 
management 
table of contents makes these estimates and judgments in the normal course of business as required pursuant to us gaap 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our results of operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis and results of operations where such changes in estimates affected our reported financial results 
a detailed discussion of the related accounting policies  and other significant accounting policies  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment testing of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
changes in management s judgments and estimates could significantly affect the company s analysis of the impairment of goodwill 
to test goodwill for impairment  the company is required to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units 
since quoted market prices in an active market are not available for our reporting units  the company uses other valuation techniques 
the company has developed a model to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  primarily incorporating a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
this model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates to use to discount those estimated cash flows 
the company estimates a corporate wide weighted average cost of capital to use as the discount rate 
this rate is applied to our reporting units until such time that the company decides to divest those units 
at such time  the company applies an entity specific discount rate to the cash flows of the reporting units 
changes to these judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
impairment testing of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when testing for impairment  the company is required to estimate the specific cash inflows and outflows expected to be generated from the long lived asset during its remaining useful life 
changes to management s judgments and estimates used in determining the timing of testing  the specific net cash flows related to the asset  the asset s remaining useful life  or the projected amount of future net cash flows could materially affect the outcome of the impairment analysis 
in addition  if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s net book value  then management must determine the fair market value of the asset 
generally  quoted market prices in active markets are not available for the company s significant long lived assets 
as such  management generally uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value 
management s assumptions regarding the discount rate used to apply to the forecasted future net cash flows can also materially affect the outcome of the impairment analysis 
deferred tax asset valuation 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  if necessary  establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we may be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
tax contingencies 
despite our belief that our tax positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance  or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax contingencies 
our contingencies are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of our tax audits as well as evolving case law 
our income tax expense includes the impact of contingency provisions and changes to our contingencies that we consider appropriate 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense at the time of resolution 
we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments

 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  fsp  which supercedes fsp fsp provides guidance related to the accounting for the effect of the subsidy on the company s postretirement health care plan at such time that a conclusion has been reached that prescription drug benefits available under the plan to some or all participants for some or all future years are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and thus qualify for the subsidy under the act  and accounting guidance for those circumstances in which the expected subsidy will offset or reduce the company s share of the cost of the underlying postretirement prescription drug coverage on which the subsidy is based 
at present  detailed regulations necessary to implement the act have not been issued  including those that would specify the manner in which actuarial equivalency must be determined  the evidence required to demonstrate actuarial equivalency  and the documentation requirements necessary to be entitled to the subsidy 
the company has deferred recognition of the effects of the new law until such time as the actuarial equivalency and the effect of the subsidy can be determined 
accordingly  the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation reflected in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements does not consider any amount associated with the subsidy

if this proposal is passed  the company would be required to recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to its employees or board members  which could have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors risk factors relating to our business increased competition could reduce the demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
competition in the promotions and marketing services business is intense and includes many competitors 
the company competes for manufacturers advertising and consumer promotion budgets with a wide range of media including television  radio  print and direct mail advertising  as well as several alternative in store and point of sale programs 
while the company believes it provides unique  cost effective targeted marketing services  there are many parameters on which a consumer packaged goods  pharmaceutical manufacturer or retailer may base its decision to allocate advertising or promotional expenditures  and there can be no assurance that our services will continue to compete effectively against other formats or that consumer packaged goods and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retailers will continue to use our marketing services 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  
table of contents to reduce sales prices of their existing products and services and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing 
in addition  changes in technology may enable merchants and retail companies to implement or install their own proprietary point of sale systems or provide other solutions for the distribution of incentives and messages 
to the extent that a retailer installs a custom point of sale system or the system of a competitor in a retail location that is incompatible or competes with our networks  it may be substantially more difficult to convince the retailer to replace such a system or add another system  and a retailer may be contractually bound to keep the installed system or exclude competitive systems for several years

a shift in consumer purchasing trends for certain categories of products from traditional retail supermarkets may cause a decrease in the utilization of our services 
significant retailers including mass marketers and value chains do not use us for their marketing services for the distribution of coupons  incentives and messages 
many retailers utilize our competitors for such services and some conduct such services in house or otherwise allocate their marketing dollars to other channels 
mass marketers and value chains have significantly increased their presence in the grocery business and retail industry over the last several years 
many mass marketers and value chains  including wal mart  are not clients of the company 
as mass marketers and value chains such as wal mart increase their presence in the grocery business  the percentage of retail grocery purchases that occur in stores where our networks are installed may decrease 
the impact of the increased presence of mass marketers and value chains is particularly pronounced in certain product categories 
in addition  if consumers continue to shift to alternative shopping channels  like club stores  mass merchandisers and value chains  the ability and effectiveness of the catalina marketing network to reach retail shoppers may decline 
any such change in shopping behavior could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
our success depends on our relationships with retailers and pharmacies that provide access to consumers in their retail locations and pharmacies 
we depend on retail stores and pharmacies to provide access to transactions with consumers and allow us to install the catalina marketing network and health resource network on their premises 
we believe that our relationships with our current retail and pharmacy clients are strong  however  in the past  some retailers and pharmacies have required us to remove our network from their stores or negotiate significantly different or less advantageous terms in order for us to maintain networks in their stores 
should any of our significant retailers or pharmacy chains reduce in size  cease to exist  not renew our agreements  require us to remove our network equipment or negotiate terms with us which are less advantageous than our current agreements  the ability and effectiveness of the catalina marketing network or health resource network to reach retail shoppers and access transactions and or the profitability of our operations could be reduced 
consolidations between our current retail and pharmacy base and companies that do not utilize our networks may decrease the installation base of our network and reduce the utilization of our services 
internationally  certain value chains and mass marketers continue to make acquisitions in the grocery industry 
further significant acquisitions and consolidations could have a material impact on our ability to maintain and expand our international operations 
we may fail to develop new products and achieve future growth 
a key element of our growth strategy is the development and sale of new services 
while new services are currently under development  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and market new services 
the company s inability or failure to devise new marketing services or to complete the development or implementation of particular services for use on a large scale  or the failure of such services to achieve market acceptance  could adversely affect our ability to achieve a significant part of its growth strategy and the absence of such growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
to retain and attract manufacturers  retailers and pharmacies  we believe 
table of contents that we must continue to introduce additional successful services 
the development and deployment of new services may require significant capital expenditures on product development and client education 
loss of data center capacity or interruption of telecommunication links could adversely affect our business 
our ability to protect our data centers against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other disasters is critical to our future 
we believe we have taken reasonable precautions to protect our data centers and telecommunication links from events that could interrupt our operations 
any damage to our data centers or any failure of our telecommunications links that causes interruptions in our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our clients requirements  which could result in decreased revenues  income and earnings per share 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position  and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights may be costly 
we hold united states and foreign patents on various aspects of the process of promotion distribution  and have applied for additional patents 
in addition  the company regards certain computer software and each service application as proprietary and attempts to protect them through copyright and trade secret laws and internal non disclosure agreements and similar safeguards 
certain aspects of our services may not be adequately protected from infringement or copying 
further  there can be no assurance that our patents or trademarks would be upheld if challenged or that competitors might not develop similar or superior processes or services outside the protection of any patents issued to the company 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our patents or other intellectual property rights  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
the actions we take to protect our patents and other proprietary rights may not be adequate 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
see item business intellectual property 
intellectual property litigation against us may be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
we expect that  as we continue to expand our service offerings and the number of competitors in targeted marketing grows  we may be increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement  unfair competition and related claims against us 
third parties may also seek to invalidate certain of our patents 
in addition  competitors and third parties may  in the future  name our clients as defendants in lawsuits  which may cause these clients to terminate their relationships with us 
our efforts to defend these actions may not be successful 
our failure to prevail in this litigation could result in our paying monetary damages which could be tripled if the infringement is found to have been willful  an injunction requiring us to stop offering our services in their current form  our having to redesign our technology and business methods  which could be costly and time consuming  even where a redesign is feasible  or our having to pay fees to license intellectual property rights  which may result in unanticipated or higher operating costs 
any third party claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and damages  cause us to reduce or alter our services  delay or prevent service enhancements or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
legislation relating to consumer privacy and changes in government regulations may affect our ability to deliver messages and incentives and collect data that we use in providing our marketing services  which could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our clients needs 
the enactment of legislation arising from public concern over consumer privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on our marketing services 
any such legislation could place restrictions upon the collection and use of information that is currently legally available  which could materially increase our cost of 
table of contents managing or collecting some data 
legislation or industry regulation could also prohibit us from collecting or disseminating certain types of data  coupons  promotions  messages or newsletters  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients requirements 
with respect to chr s health resource network  our ability to provide consumers with condition specific health information and direct to patient communications may be adversely affected by concerns over heath regulatory guidelines and publicity regarding a patient s rights to privacy 
recent proposed regulatory changes in some jurisdictions have increased manufacturer and retailer sensitivity and selectiveness as to what types of messages they will distribute in these jurisdictions 
while we are currently working with our manufacturer and retailer clients to find an adequate solution to these concerns  there is no guaranty that we will be able to continue to distribute our newsletters for these clients or that there will not be additional changes in the laws and regulations in these and other jurisdictions that will further impact our operations

risks related to the investigations and shareholder lawsuits we are the subject of a formal investigation by the sec 
if the investigation was to result in a regulatory proceeding or action against us  then our business and financial condition could be harmed 
on march   the sec issued a formal order of private investigation of the company 
this action follows an sec informal investigation initiated by the sec after representatives of the company contacted the sec on june   to inform the sec of certain revenue recognition timing issues that management of the company identified at chr 
the company believes that the sec inquiry is focused primarily on the revenue recognition timing issues at chr during fiscal years  and  which fiscal years were the subject of the various adjustments and restatements described in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  the company is cooperating with the sec 
as of the date hereof  the company is not aware of any additional inquiry or investigation having been commenced against the company related to these matters  but the company cannot predict whether or not any such regulatory inquiry or investigation will be commenced or  if it is  the outcome of any such inquiry or investigation 
if the current or any future investigation was to result in action against the company  the company s business and financial condition could be harmed 
see  item legal proceedings government investigations 
we have incurred substantial costs and the investigation has caused a diversion of our management s time and attention 
the length of time it may take to resolve the investigation may have an unfavorable impact on investor confidence 
as a result  the market price at which our common stock trades has been  and may continue to be  adversely affected 
we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are defendants in several stockholder class action lawsuits 
the company  and certain present and former officers and directors of the company and chr  were named as defendants in numerous complaints purporting to be class actions which were consolidated in the united states district court for the middle district of florida 
the complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief 
in addition  certain present and former officers and directors of the company and chr  and catalina marketing  as a nominal defendant  have been named in two shareholder derivative actions 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages  restitution of improper salaries  insider trading profits and payments from the company  and disgorgement under the sarbanes oxley act of we intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits 
we cannot currently predict the impact or resolution of this litigation or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss  which could be material  and the resolution of these lawsuits may harm our business and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
securities lawsuits may result in substantial costs  divert management s attention and other resources  and have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations in the future 

table of contents ongoing review of our public filings by the sec may result in the further amendment or restatement of our periodic reports  and the nyse may delist our common stock or take other action if we are unable to comply with its listing requirements 
if any of the foregoing occurred  there could be a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets 
the sec may provide us with comments on these filings or any of our previous filings  which would require us to amend or restate previously filed periodic reports 
the nyse did not take any delisting or other action against the company in connection with its previous delinquent filings  but there can be no assurance that the nyse will not take any such action in the future 
if we are required to amend or restate our periodic filings  or if the nyse delists  or attempts to delist  our common stock  investor confidence may be reduced  our stock price may substantially decrease and our ability to access the capital markets may be limited 
the company is still implementing its plan to improve its internal controls 
the company was first informed during the course of the audits of fiscal years and and re audit of fiscal years and by our certified registered public accounting firm that they had identified certain material weaknesses and significant deficiencies which  if unaddressed  could result in accounting errors in our consolidated financial statements 
if these material weaknesses and significant deficiencies are not corrected or other accounting related problems emerge  the company could face additional litigation exposure and great scrutiny from the sec and our financial condition may be adversely affected 
recently enacted changes in the securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs and we may be unable to obtain the attestation of the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july the act has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of that act  the sec and the nyse have promulgated new rules 
compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs  and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain or obtain coverage 
in addition  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 
if our independent registered certified public accounting firm is unable to provide us with the attestation of the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting as of march  and future year ends as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of your shares 
as directed by section of the act  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  the public accounting firm auditing the company s financial statements must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
while we intend to conduct a rigorous review of our internal control over financial reporting in order to assure compliance with the section requirements  if our independent registered certified public accounting firm interprets the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from us or if our independent registered certified public accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which it is documented  operated or reviewed  they may decline to attest to management s assessment or issue a qualified report 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our shares to decline

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risks are interest rates on various debt instruments and foreign exchange rates at the company s international subsidiaries 
interest rates the company centrally manages its domestic debt and considers investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
this domestic debt consists of a line of credit with interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or the federal funds rate 
international debt relates to the company s japan subsidiaries and is used to fund the purchases of coupon equipment and billboards and for day to day operations 
additionally  interest expense associated with the indebtedness for our corporate headquarters is based on fluctuating short term interest rates 
these rates are based on the libor rate and can be adjusted based on short term rates up to six months 
a basis point change in interest rates  based on the march  and debt would not have had a material impact on our operations in fiscal years or  respectively 
foreign operations our operations outside of the united states expose the company to movements in currency exchange rates  which can be volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is complex because such changes are often linked to variances in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to change its financing and operating strategies 
our revenues from foreign operations represented approximately of the company s total revenues in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year the aggregate foreign exchange effects included in determining consolidated results of operations were approximately a million gain in the company s consolidated net income in fiscal year  a million gain in fiscal year and a million loss in fiscal year the company has not utilized derivative financial instruments to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
the company estimates that  based upon its fiscal year end consolidated balance sheet and the fiscal year end consolidated balance sheet  a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material effect on operating profit in fiscal year or fiscal year  respectively 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because it does not take into account the impact of macroeconomic factors or changes in either results of operations or our financing and operating strategies
