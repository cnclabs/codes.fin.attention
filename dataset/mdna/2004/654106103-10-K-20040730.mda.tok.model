item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nike designs  develops and markets high quality footwear  apparel  equipment  and accessory products worldwide 
we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts in the united states and through a mix of independent distributors  licensees and subsidiaries in over countries 
our goal is to deliver value to five constituencies shareholders  consumers  business partners  employees and the community 
we aim to deliver that value by focusing on our mission to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world if you have a body  you are an athlete 
and building our capabilities in four key areas deepening our relationship with consumers  delivering superior  innovative product to the marketplace  making our supply chain a competitive advantage  through operational discipline and excellence  and accelerating growth through focused execution 
we believe we can create value for our shareholders in striving for the following key long term financial goals high single digit revenue growth  mid teens earnings per share growth  increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and delivery of consistent results through management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 

table of contents in fiscal we met or surpassed these goals primarily through a combination of revenue growth and gross margin improvements across our businesses  management of working capital and share repurchases 
in addition  the impact of foreign currency changes has had a significant favorable impact on this year s financial results 
although in any particular quarter or even annual period we may not meet some or all of the financial goals outlined above  we believe these are appropriate goals for the longer term 
results of operations change change revenues cost of sales gross margin gross margin selling and administrative of revenues income before cumulative effect of accounting change net income diluted earnings per share before accounting change diluted earnings per share fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated operating results in fiscal  consolidated revenues grew percent versus fiscal  seven percentage points of this growth can be attributed to changes in currency exchange rates  primarily the stronger euro 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency  revenue growth in our international regions contributed percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth and all three of our international regions posted higher revenues  with our asia pacific region making the largest contribution 
converse  which was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  contributed percentage points of consolidated revenue growth 
see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note acquisition for additional information related to the acquisition 
improved sales in the u 
s region and increases in our other businesses drove the balance of the consolidated revenue growth 
during fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage improved basis points versus the prior year  from to 
the primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal were as follows changes in hedge rates  primarily the euro  represented basis points of improvement for fiscal the positive impact of hedge rates on the fiscal gross margin percentage was most significant in the fourth quarter  contributing basis points of the year over year quarterly improvement 
as a majority of product purchases for fiscal have been hedged  we expect a positive impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal due to improved year over year hedge rates  primarily for the euro 
see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note risk management and derivatives for additional information on hedges 
higher in line pricing margins net revenue for current product offerings minus landed product cost drove approximately basis points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal this is primarily attributable to improved footwear margins as a result of lower product costs due to manufacturing efficiencies  reduced materials costs and lower air freight 

table of contents improved profitability on wholesale closeout sales non current product offerings  primarily in the us and europe  middle east and africa emea regions due to improved closeout pricing margins  partially offset by increased obsolescence reserves due to a less favorable mix of product remaining in closeout inventory 
these factors represented approximately basis points of the improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage for fiscal most of the remaining increase was due to improved gross margin percentages for nike owned retail stores in the us and emea regions  which contributed approximately basis points of the improvement in consolidated gross margins for fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expense  comprised of demand creation and operating overhead  grew versus fiscal demand creation advertising and promotion expense grew to  million in fiscal seven percentage points of the increase in demand creation was due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates  the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on endorsement contracts in the us  primarily basketball percentage point impact  incremental investment in retail marketing in the us  emea  and asia pacific regions percentage point impact  and higher advertising spending in the asia pacific region percentage point impact 
the addition of converse contributed percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year 
operating overhead for fiscal was  million  a increase over fiscal currency exchange rates contributed percentage points of the increase 
the addition of converse accounted for percentage points of growth 
other key factors driving the increase in operating overhead for the fiscal year were a increased incentive based compensation for employees percentage points  and b increased costs to support the growth of our nike golf  cole haan  bauer nike hockey and hurley businesses percentage points 
the remaining increase  about percentage points  is primarily attributable to normal wage increases and some added infrastructure necessary to support global business growth  including costs related to our worldwide supply chain initiative and additional factory outlet stores in the emea region 
over the last five years  as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain  we have implemented new systems in canada  the us and emea regions and are now implementing them in japan  southeast asia and our hong kong apparel operations 
over the next few years  we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in these operations and complete the implementation of new systems in the remainder of our global operations 
this initiative is intended to improve revenue by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions  improve margins by lowering the volume of close out inventories and distribution costs including inbound air freight  and improve cash flow by reducing inventories and accounts receivable through better visibility 
in the us and emea regions  where the new systems have been in place for over a year  we have begun to see improvements in several key performance measures including gross margins see above and cash flows see below 
the ultimate level of benefit to revenues  margins  and cash flows will not be known until the new systems and processes have been implemented in the remaining countries in which we operate and globally integrated in subsequent years 
at fiscal year end  approximately percent of nike s businesses had completed implementation of the new systems 
during the period of implementation  operating overhead expense will continue to include both the cost of implementing and operating new systems and the cost of supporting the legacy systems 
we anticipate completing the majority of the remaining implementations over the next two years 
other expense  net  was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal beginning this fiscal year  interest income and profit sharing expense previously included in other expense  net  are included in interest expense  net  and selling and administrative expense  respectively 
the presentation of prior year amounts has been adjusted to conform to the current classification 
the most significant components of other expense  net comprising approximately percent of this year s net expense and percent of fiscal s net expense  was foreign currency losses primarily hedge losses on intercompany charges to a european subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro  and hedge losses from that subsidiary s investments in us dollar denominated debt securities available for sale 
these losses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment 
table of contents presentation of pre tax income in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note operating segments and related information 
the hedge losses reflect that the euro has strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts 
also included in other expense  net  for fiscal was an increase in net losses on asset disposals  including a loss of million on land gifted to the nike foundation in the first quarter 
in  net foreign currency losses in other expense  net  were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits  most significantly in emea 
our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year 
consistent with our existing policies  in fiscal we have continued to hedge a portion of anticipated intercompany charges and investments in us dollar denominated debt securities available for sale 
we expect the net impact of any hedge losses or gains and the offsetting translation impact will result in a significantly lower net benefit to fiscal than was realized in fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  which is higher than the fiscal rate of as a result of a higher tax provision on foreign earnings in fiscal included in net income for fiscal was a million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas 
this charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with bauer nike hockey and the goodwill of cole haan  reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values 
see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for further information 
worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november were higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal one point of this reported increase was due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year 
excluding this currency impact  higher average selling prices for footwear across all regions contributed points of the growth in overall futures and advance orders 
the remaining increase was due to volume increases for both apparel and footwear 
on our june  press release  we reported that worldwide futures and advance orders for this period were up as compared to last year 
our futures program permits changes to orders for a short period of time following the order deadline 
such changes to orders  most notably in the us and asia pacific regions  increased the growth in worldwide futures for the june through november period by percentage points to 
as always  the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders  including wholesale sales of equipment  us licensed team apparel  bauer nike hockey  cole haan  converse  nike golf  hurley  and retail sales across all brands

for emea  our largest international region  changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for percentage points of the reported increase in revenues in fiscal the remaining increase over the prior year was primarily driven by nike owned retail due to the addition of new stores in fiscal and increased footwear volume led by soccer product 
excluding the impact of currency exchange movements  sales in each emea business unit footwear  apparel  equipment grew versus fiscal after several years in which the region s revenues grew substantially faster than the overall market in europe  fiscal revenue growth for emea was more in line with the growth of the overall market 
futures orders for the region scheduled for delivery from june through november were percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal  changes in currency exchange rates accounted for about percentage points of this growth 
an increase in the region s footwear average price per pair contributed to this futures order growth 

table of contents emea pre tax income for fiscal was million  up versus the prior year 
higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase  more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs 
the improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved year over year hedge rates and higher in line and closeout pricing margins 
in the asia pacific region  fiscal revenues increased year over year 
eight percentage points of growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the impact of currency exchange movements  sales in each asia pacific business unit grew versus fiscal the region s revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases  with significant revenue growth in china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand and japan driven by strong consumer demand 
pre tax income for the asia pacific region increased to million in fiscal  up versus fiscal higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase  more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs 
the higher gross margins were primarily attributable to higher in line pricing margins and the benefit of better hedge rates on product purchases  partially offset by lower profitability of closeouts 
in the americas region  revenues increased compared to fiscal  with percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the currency effects  the revenue growth was driven primarily by stronger consumer demand in south america and sales in each americas business unit grew versus fiscal in fiscal  pre tax income for the americas region increased from the prior year  to million 
the increase in pre tax income was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates slightly offset by reduced gross margins and higher selling and administrative costs 
gross margins fell due to lower in line pricing margins as well as weaker currency exchange rates in mexico 
in the us region  revenues for fiscal grew versus fiscal  as revenues increased in each business unit 
the increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in sport performance product and increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel primarily in the first half of fiscal the increase in footwear revenue was due to an increase in average wholesale selling price per pair and increased sales in nike owned retail stores  partially offset by a slight decline in wholesale unit sales 
the increase in average wholesale selling price per pair was partially due to a larger percentage of sales of products with a suggested retail price over the slight decline in us footwear wholesale unit sales was largely due to changes in distribution to several retail customers 
for the first half of the year  sales to our largest customer  foot locker  were lower as a result of changes to our distribution strategy implemented in fiscal and  while the decline in first half sales resulted in slightly lower sales for the full year  our year over year sales to foot locker grew in the second half of fiscal in addition  fiscal sales declined for another large customer  footstar  which declared bankruptcy in march the sales declines for foot locker and footstar were partially offset by increased sales to other accounts 
for the us region  futures orders scheduled for delivery from june through november increased percentage points versus the prior year 
higher orders from foot locker were a factor in this increase 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  foot locker acquired additional stores from footstar 
further  as announced in november additional premium product offerings were made available to select foot locker locations beginning with the fall season 
growth in futures orders from foot locker as compared to the prior year s orders from foot locker and footstar combined  contributed percentage points of the overall region s futures orders growth 
additionally  futures orders grew as a result of increases in average wholesale selling price per pair for footwear  due to increased orders for products with a suggested retail price over 
table of contents for fiscal  pre tax income for the us region was  million  a increase versus fiscal higher revenues and gross margins drove the increase  more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs 
the improved gross margins were primarily the result of higher in line and closeout pricing margins and expanded retail margins 
the other segment includes results from bauer nike hockey inc  cole haan holdings incorporated  converse inc  hurley international llc and nike golf 
revenues for other grew in fiscal compared to fiscal  the addition of converse contributed percentage points of the increase 
the remainder of the increase was due to revenue growth at nike golf  cole haan  hurley and bauer nike hockey 
pre tax income for other improved to million in fiscal  versus income of million in fiscal the addition of converse  combined with improved results from nike golf and cole haan  drove the year over year improvement 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated operating results revenue growth in our international regions drove the increase in consolidated revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal changes in currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  contributed percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth 
in fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage improved basis points as compared to fiscal  from to 
significant factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage were as follows product cost reductions resulting from our global initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce materials costs  and a higher mix of sales of classic footwear models which are generally more profitable than our more complex performance models 
lower pricing of nike golf products as a result of market conditions discussed below partially offset these positive margin drivers 
changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal as the benefit of stronger hedge rates in some currencies was offset by weaker hedge rates in other currencies 
selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal both demand creation and operating overhead expense increased as a percentage of revenues 
demand creation expense grew from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal higher costs incurred in the emea region drove the growth in demand creation expense  reflecting  a stronger euro currency exchange rate compared to the us dollar  which resulted in higher us dollar expenses for costs that are euro denominated  our new endorsement agreement with the manchester united soccer team that became effective in august  and costs of our world cup marketing campaign incurred in the first quarter of fiscal higher demand creation expenses were also incurred in the asia pacific and americas regions due to the world cup marketing campaign 
we also increased demand creation spending in the us in order to drive continued consumer demand for footwear while we realigned our distribution to retail customers 
operating overhead increased from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal major drivers of this increase were the stronger euro exchange rate  incremental costs related to our on going development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain  primarily reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in note operating segments and related information  investments in headcount for our nike golf business  the addition of hurley overhead costs beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and overhead costs of additional retail stores in the emea and asia pacific regions 

table of contents interest expense  net  decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decline of 
the decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels  as we have used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt 
other expense  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal significant amounts included in other expense  net were goodwill amortization fiscal only  and certain foreign currency gains and losses 
an increase in net foreign currency losses was the largest contributor to the increase in other expense  net for fiscal versus fiscal these foreign currency losses were primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany charges to a european subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro 
these losses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pre tax income in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note operating segments and related information 
the hedge losses reflected that the euro had strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts 
in fiscal  net foreign currency losses in other expense  net were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits 
our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation was a million addition to consolidated income before income taxes 
our fiscal effective tax rate was  relatively consistent with the fiscal effective rate of 
included in fiscal net income was a million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing fas this charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with bauer nike hockey and the goodwill of cole haan  reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values 
in addition  the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a reduction to goodwill and intangible asset amortization of million as compared to fiscal see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for further information 
operating segments our largest international region  emea  reported revenue growth in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth reflected a percentage point improvement due to changes in currency exchange rates 
growth in the emerging markets in central and eastern europe was the key driver of the balance of the increase  as our distribution continued to expand in these markets and customer demand increased 
excluding the effect from changes in currency exchange rates  each of our emea business units delivered revenue growth versus the prior year 
emea pre tax income grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal higher revenues and improved gross margins drove the increase  more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs 
in asia pacific  revenues increased in fiscal  five percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates 
excluding the benefit from changes in currency exchange rates  sales in each asia pacific business unit grew in fiscal  as did sales in almost every country of the region  particularly japan and korea  driven primarily by heightened consumer demand for our products following the world cup and our related marketing campaign  and china  driven primarily by an expansion of retail distribution of our products 
pre tax income for the asia pacific region increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase reflected higher revenues and improved gross margins that more than offset higher selling and administrative costs 
in the americas region  fiscal revenues decreased compared to fiscal  reflecting higher sales in local currencies that were more than offset by a percentage point decline due to changes in currency exchange rates 
this currency exchange impact was due to weaker currencies in the latin american markets  partially offset by the stronger canadian dollar 
excluding the currency exchange rate impact  the region 
table of contents experienced sales growth in the footwear and equipment business units slightly offset by a small percentage decrease in the apparel business unit 
on a geographic basis  excluding currency exchange rate impacts  the region experienced sales growth in brazil  argentina  and mexico  reflecting stronger consumer demand 
the sales growth in argentina reflected a rebound since fiscal when that country underwent an economic crisis 
pre tax income for the americas region grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pre tax income improved despite lower reported revenues primarily due to an improved gross margin percentage 
in the us region  revenues were down slightly in fiscal  at  million versus  million in fiscal us footwear revenues were down  more than offsetting sales growth in us apparel and equipment 
us apparel sales increased million  primarily driven by increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel 
lower revenues in the footwear business unit were largely the result of a significant change in our us footwear distribution 
during fiscal  we began a realignment of our us footwear distribution to address the changing retail marketplace  including our largest customer s foot locker reduction in emphasis on premium footwear in its offerings 
the objectives of this realignment were to improve the presentation and profitability of the nike brand in the us as a result of changes in both foot locker s orders and our product offerings to this account  our fiscal sales to foot locker in the us were significantly below the level of fiscal at the same time  we expanded the premium products available to other athletic specialty and independent retailers that focus on premium footwear offerings  increasing sales to these accounts significantly 
our unit sales of footwear in the us increased slightly as compared to fiscal however  this volume increase was more than offset by a decline in the average price per pair of footwear sold 
the reduction in average price per pair in fiscal versus fiscal reflected a higher percentage of sales of classic footwear and kids models  which have a lower average price than our more complex adult performance models 
us region pre tax income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pre tax income improved  despite lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense  due to improved gross margins 
revenues for other grew in fiscal compared to fiscal the addition of revenues from our hurley business  purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal  drove the increase in other revenues 
pre tax income for other declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal reduced profitability at nike golf drove this decline  reflecting significantly weaker demand in the us golf market versus fiscal and start up issues we experienced at a third party distribution facility 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal cash flow activity cash provided by operations was billion in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of million 
in addition to the improvement in net income  the increase in cash compared to the prior year was attributable to changes in our investment in working capital primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable excluding the acquisition of converse and the effects of foreign currency  which were reported separately 
in fiscal accounts receivable provided cash to the company due to improved account management through better utilization of supply chain systems  especially in emea 
accounts payable provided cash to the company due to the timing of inventory receipts and vendor payments 
the changes in other working capital components were consistent with normal business operations 
cash used by investing activities during fiscal was million  compared to million invested during fiscal the most significant uses of cash for investing activities in fiscal were the 
table of contents purchase of short term investments and the acquisition of converse  which accounted for million and million  respectively 
the remaining investing activities are consistent with the prior year and primarily reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software to support both normal business operations as well as our supply chain systems upgrade  continued investment in nike owned retail stores  and construction of a storage facility in japan  which was completed in fiscal cash used by financing activities in fiscal was million  down from million in the prior year 
in fiscal  the principal uses of cash for financing activities were share repurchases  payments of long term debt  and dividends  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and debt issuance 
net cash used by financing activities was higher in fiscal primarily due to increased repayments of short term debt in that period 
the share repurchases were part of a billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal in fiscal  we repurchased million shares of nike s class b common stock for million  completing the program 
over the course of the four year program  we purchased a total of million shares of nike s class b common stock 
in june  the board of directors approved a new billion share repurchase program to be completed over the next four years 
we expect to continue to fund the new program from operating cash flow 
the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 
dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal were  compared to in fiscal we have paid a dividend every quarter since february we review our dividend policy from time to time  and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations our significant long term contractual obligations as of may  are as follows cash payments due during the year ended may  description of commitment thereafter total in millions operating leases long term debt endorsement contracts product purchase obligations other total the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products 
actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods 
actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as a limited number of contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods 
in addition to the cash payments  we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with nike products for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source  and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

table of contents we generally order product four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements  including open purchase orders for non product purchases 
the reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor s services 
if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may   we would be required to provide the contractor with four months notice and pay a termination fee of million 
our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate million 
we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of may  please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note short term borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below 
outstanding as of may  in millions notes payable  due at mutually agreed upon dates  generally ninety days from issuance or on demand payable to sojitz corporation of america sojitz america for the purchase of inventories  generally due sixty days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding  primarily for the purchase of inventory 
all letters of credit generally expire within one year 
capital resources in october  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec under which billion in debt securities may be issued 
in may  we commenced a medium term note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to million in medium term notes  as our capital needs dictate 
we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements 
during fiscal  we issued five notes under the medium term note program totaling million 
four of those notes totaling million have fixed coupon interest rates of and mature on october  the other million note has a fixed coupon interest rate of and matures on october  for each of the notes  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month london inter bank offering rate libor plus a spread 
the swaps have the same notional amounts and maturity dates as the notes  and are accounted for as fair value hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  except for the swap for the million note maturing october  the swap for that note has the same notional amount and fixed coupon interest rate as the note  but expires october  accordingly  the swap does not qualify for fair value hedge accounting  so changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded in net income each period as a component of other expense  net 
after issuance of these notes  million remains available to be issued under the shelf registration 
we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal depending on general corporate needs 

table of contents as of may   we had a year million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks  and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility 
the maturity date is november  and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date 
based on our current long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively  the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing libor plus 
the facility fee is of the total commitment 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities 
under this committed credit facility  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur  and set a minimum capitalization ratio 
in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program  under which there was no amount outstanding at may  or may  we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
we currently believe that cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

table of contents in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

table of contents some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property  plant and equipment may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
any impairment charges are recorded as other expense  net 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted fas effective for the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by fas  in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors  including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
our estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  technological change  economic conditions  changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
as discussed further above  upon adoption of fas in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets of million 
this charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change 
post the first quarter of fiscal  any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 
other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense  net 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
in these cases  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value 
any impairment charges would be classified as other expense  net 

table of contents hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance 
when specific criteria required by fas have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes significantly  we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense  net during the quarter in which such changes occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings declared as reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided being determined in the future to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 

table of contents other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements 
we use forward exchange contracts  options and cross currency swaps to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months  although at may  we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european and japanese subsidiaries 
we use forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in european currencies  japanese yen  canadian dollars  korean won  mexican pesos and australian dollars 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of medium and long term fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay variable interest 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments  as defined by the sec  are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  cross currency swaps  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var 
table of contents computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only  and hence does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based transactions that are anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the increase in var as of may  occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may  var computation versus the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may  var computation 
such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
details of other market sensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below  except the interest rate swaps which are described below 
these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
expected maturity date year ended may  thereafter total fair value in millions  except interest rates foreign exchange risk euro functional currency intercompany loan us dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan british pound denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency intercompany loan japanese yen denominated variable rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loan canadian dollar denominated fixed rate principal payments average interest rate japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate 
table of contents expected maturity date year ended may  thereafter total fair value in millions  except interest rates principal payments average interest rate interest rate risk japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency long term us dollar debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation 
intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties 
the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 
there were no significant changes in debt or cross currency swap market risks during fiscal cross currency swaps outstanding as of may  matured in fiscal and no new cross currency swaps were executed during fiscal the us dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies was million at may   which is the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination 
the us dollar fair value of the fixed rate japanese yen denominated debt that was outstanding at may  was million versus a carrying value of million at that date 
the us dollar fair values of the fixed rate us dollar denominated debt  the euro swap payable and the us dollar swap receivable as of may  were million  million and million  respectively  versus carrying values of million  million and million  respectively  at that date 
in fiscal we issued a million long term fixed rate corporate bond which matures in august in fiscal and  we issued an additional million in long term fixed rate corporate bonds which mature on various dates beginning in july through october fixed interest rates on these bonds range from to 
for each of the bonds issued in fiscal  and fiscal  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the three month or six month libor plus a spread 
each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond  except for one swap for a million bond issued in fiscal maturing in october that swap expires in october as a result of the interest rate swap agreements  the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was at may  and at may  these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges  so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt  except for the million swap expiring in october which is not accounted for as a hedge 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period 
the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net million gain at may  and a million gain at may  the fair value of the million interest rate swap expiring october was a million loss at may  in fiscal we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries 
the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on month libor plus a spread 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at and receives variable interest payments based on month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of billion japanese yen 
this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge  accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period 
the recorded fair value of the swap was a million gain at may  and a million loss at may
