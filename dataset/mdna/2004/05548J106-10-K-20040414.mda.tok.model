item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless noted otherwise  the fiscal year ended january  is referred to as other fiscal years are referred to in a similar manner 
general overview bj s is a leading warehouse club operator in the eastern united states 
as of january   we operated warehouse clubs and gasoline stations in states 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to achieve high volumes of sales and rapid inventory turnover  to attract and retain members and to control costs 
we believe that our pricing and cost structure is a major competitive advantage for us 
our revenues are derived from the sale of a wide range of food and general merchandise items  the sale of gasoline and from membership fees 
paid membership is an essential component in our business 
it not only provides a source of revenue  but it promotes customer loyalty 
membership fees permit us to offer lower prices to our members  encouraging them to shop us more frequently 
member renewal rates are a key performance indicator for us 
comparable store sales performance is an important measure throughout the retail industry 
our comparable club sales increase from to was 
our top priority in was to improve our comparable club sales performance and  as discussed below  we set into motion a number of initiatives to accomplish this 
our low merchandise margin rates drive the high sales volumes that are critical in our business 
our merchandise margin rate is a key metric in achieving both our top line and bottom line objectives 
we believe that the cost structure built into our business model puts us among the most efficient in the retail industry 
we closely monitor our costs as a percentage of sales  particularly our payroll costs  which comprise the largest portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
we place a great deal of emphasis on control of our inventories 
because of our high sales volumes and inventory turns  we are able to generate cash from a large portion of our inventory before we are required to pay our merchandise vendors 
the majority of our inventory purchases are routed through our cross dock facilities  including two new state of the art facilities which were built in and we monitor several inventory related measures  including inventory turns  accounts payable as a percentage of inventories  average inventories per club and shrinkage as a percentage of sales 
overview of operations during the second half of  our senior management team performed a strategic analysis of our current position within the warehouse club industry as well as our sales and earnings prospects for the future 
we affirmed our commitment to a business model based  in part  on long term objectives to achieve comparable club merchandise sales growth of  annual selling square footage growth of up to and annual growth in earnings per share in the range of 
to support these objectives  we began making new investments in merchandising  marketing  technology and club appearance that continued throughout most of our initiatives in were focused on increasing sales and market share 
in last year s annual report on form k  we said that  in order to achieve sales increases  we planned to lower margins on certain merchandise and gasoline  increase marketing expenses and increase club payroll to execute our initiatives in we said that incentive pay expenses were expected to increase above their minimal level in we expected that these increases in expenses would result in lower net income than we experienced in  but we believed that it was in bj s best interest to drive sales in by increasing member traffic in our clubs and by making investments that would help differentiate us from our wholesale club competition 

table of contents we achieved comparable club sales increases that were at the high end of our target range for comparable club sales strengthened in the second half of the year 
as we expected a year ago  our merchandise margins decreased from the previous year and our marketing  club payroll and incentive pay expenses increased 
market conditions allowed us to achieve higher gasoline margins 
while our net income in was lower than that of the previous year  we exceeded our net income goal for the year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis and make judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on a number of factors 
these factors include historical experience  guidance provided by outside experts and assumptions made by management that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this section summarizes critical accounting policies and the related judgments involved in their application 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise when the customer takes delivery of and title to the merchandise  typically at the time of purchase in the club 
in the limited instances when the customer is not able to take delivery at the club  shipping terms are normally fob shipping point 
in all cases  revenue from the sale of merchandise is not recognized until title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
membership fee revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the membership  which is typically twelve months 
cash consideration received from vendors we receive various types of cash consideration from vendors  principally in the form of rebates and allowances 
we recognize such vendor rebates and allowances as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to the underlying transaction that results in progress by bj s toward earning the rebates and allowances  provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable 
otherwise  rebates and allowances are recognized only when predetermined milestones are met 
we review the status of all rebates and allowances at least once per quarter and update our estimates  if necessary  at that time 
we believe that our review process has allowed us to avoid material adjustments in vendor rebates and allowances 
inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined under the average cost method  or market 
we recognize the write down of slow moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write downs are probable and estimable 
records are maintained at the stockkeeping unit sku level 
a report that details the number of weeks of selling supply for each sku allows our merchandising staff to make timely markdown decisions to help maintain rapid inventory turnover  which is essential in our business 
the carrying value of any sku whose selling price is marked down to below cost is immediately reduced to that selling price 
we take physical inventories of merchandise on a cycle basis at every location each year 
a second physical inventory is taken at the end of the year at selected locations 
we estimate a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period between physical inventories 
this estimate is based on historical results of previous physical inventories  shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
long lived assets we review the realizability of our long lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
current and expected operating results and cash flows and other factors are considered in connection with our reviews 
significant judgments are made in projecting future cash flows and are based on a number of factors  including the maturity level of the club  historical experience of clubs with similar characteristics  recent trends and general economic assumptions 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired assets 

table of contents deferred taxes as of january   we had not established a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets because those assets can be realized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future taxable income  which management believes will more likely than not be earned  based on our historical record and projected earnings 
significant changes in projections of future taxable income could result in our establishment of a valuation allowance  which would reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets 
reserves for closed store lease obligations during the fiscal year ended february   we established reserves for our liability related to househome  inc househome leases 
pursuant to an agreement with the tjx companies  inc tjx  we agreed to indemnify tjx for of househome s lease liabilities guaranteed by tjx through january  and for of any such liabilities thereafter 
househome filed for bankruptcy in november see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our recorded liabilities were based on the present value of rent liabilities under the househome leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on estimated incremental borrowing rates for the company during the weighted average period of time over which these obligations were expected to be paid 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our househome reserves based on progress made in settling our obligations and the status of ongoing negotiations and make appropriate adjustments to the reserves as a result of our evaluations 
as of january   of the househome leases for which we were contingently liable have been settled  including lump sum settlements for leases 
three other househome properties for which we remain contingently liable have been assigned to third parties 
during the fiscal year ended february   we established reserves for our lease liabilities for three bj s clubs which were closed in november two of these clubs were in the columbus  ohio  market and one was in north dade  florida 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our recorded liabilities are based on the present value of rent liabilities under these leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate for the company during the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
a considerable amount of judgment was involved in determining our net liability related to the closed club leases  particularly in estimating potential sublease income 
based on our knowledge of real estate conditions in the local markets and our experience in those markets  we assumed an average period of time it would take to sublease the properties and the amount of potential sublease income for each property 
net payments that we make to settle our lease obligations will reduce operating cash flows in varying amounts over the remaining terms of the leases  which expire at various times up to instead of subleasing the properties  we may satisfy our obligations through lump sum settlements  which could result in accelerated cash outflows 
as of january   none of the leases for the three bj s clubs which were closed in november has been settled or subleased 
self insurance reserves we are primarily self insured for workers compensation and general liability claims 
reported reserves for these claims are derived from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims 
estimates are based on valuations provided by third party actuaries  historical loss development factors  and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

comparable club sales increased by from to  including a contribution from gasoline sales of 
on a comparable club basis food sales increased by and general merchandise sales increased by in comparable club sales strengthened in the second half of the year  aided by merchandising and marketing initiatives that increased traffic in the clubs and the stimuli provided by tax rebates and an improving economy 
the negative impact from new competition and self cannibalization also lessened in the second half of the year 
gasoline sales at comparable clubs were driven by higher prices as well as increased volume 
total revenues included membership fees of million in versus million in this increase was due primarily to new clubs 
membership fees also benefited from members in four atlanta clubs who renewed their membership for a fee in after we offered free one year memberships in these clubs when they opened in membership renewal rates in changed slightly from those of the previous year 
inner circle members increased at a rate of in versus in business members renewed at a rate of in compared with in cost of sales including buying and occupancy expenses was of net sales in versus of net sales in this increase was due primarily to planned lower merchandise margins resulting from our initiatives to increase sales and market share 
almost of the increase in the cost of sales ratio was due to decreased merchandise margins and the increased sales contribution of gasoline  with the remainder due to increased buying and occupancy expenses 
while the gross margin rate in gasoline is significantly lower than the overall gross margin rate for the remainder of bj s business  market conditions allowed us to realize higher than normal gasoline margins in while maintaining our price advantage against our competitors 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were of net sales in versus in the increase in the sg a ratio was due mainly to increases in incentive pay expenses  advertising  club payroll and credit expenses 
the increase in incentive pay expenses reflected a more normal level of incentive pay in compared to s unusually low incentive pay expenses 
increased advertising and club payroll expenses were planned in connection with our initiatives to increase sales and market share 
total sg a expenses rose by million from to  due mainly to the factors that increased sg a expenses as a percentage of sales  as well as the addition of new clubs

based on significant progress made in settling liabilities for househome leases  we recorded pretax gains of million in and million in to reduce our liability for contingent lease obligations 
these were partially offset by pretax accretion charges in connection with these obligations of million in and million in see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our income tax provision was of pretax income from continuing operations in the tax provision in included a credit of million in connection with a settlement between bj s and househome in the fourth quarter

per diluted share  to close the three clubs and post tax operating losses of million for these clubs 
as of the beginning of  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

we recorded a post tax charge of million  or 
per diluted share  in the first quarter to reflect the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting principle change in net income was million  or per diluted share  in versus million  or per diluted share  in comparison of to net sales increased by from to this increase was due to the opening of new clubs and new gasoline stations and to comparable club sales increases 
increases in comparable club sales represented of the total increase in net sales from to new clubs accounted for the remainder of the increases 

table of contents comparable club sales increased by from to  including a contribution from gasoline sales of 
comparable club sales results in reflected a generally weaker economic climate  price deflation in a number of food and general merchandise categories and increased competition 
total revenues included membership fees of million in versus million in this increase was due mainly to an increase in bj s membership fee from to  effective january   and to new members 
because members renew throughout the year and because membership fee income is realized over the life of the membership  the benefit of the fee increase was spread over and business members renewed at a rate of and inner circle members renewed at a rate of in both and we entered the atlanta market with four new clubs in because atlanta was a market where bj s had no other clubs  very limited name recognition and two entrenched competitors  we tested a program of free first year memberships during the preopening and initial opening periods of the new atlanta clubs in we believe that the initial free membership offer attracted more members and generated more sales in these clubs in than would have been the case if new members had to pay a membership fee 
cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs was of net sales in versus in the increase in the cost of sales percentage from to was due to decreased merchandise gross margins and the increased sales contribution of gasoline  which together combined for approximately of the increase in the cost of sales ratio  and higher occupancy expenses  which accounted for most of the remainder of the increase 
gross margins on merchandise sales were lower in because of an unfavorable sales mix toward lower margin consumables and because of certain pricing initiatives begun in the fourth quarter to drive additional sales 
the gross margin rate on gasoline sales is significantly lower than the overall gross margin rate for the rest of bj s business 
occupancy expenses increased as a percentage of sales due to lower than planned comparable club sales increases and the opening of new clubs which generally start out with lower sales volumes than mature clubs in the eighteen months preceding the end of sg a expenses were of net sales in versus in the increase in the sg a ratio in was due principally to increases in payroll  debit and credit card expenses and medical insurance  partially offset by lower incentive pay expenses and the increased contribution of gasoline sales  which have low related sg a costs 
we also incurred million of asset impairment charges in sg a in the sg a ratio in general was unfavorably impacted by the effect of lower than planned comparable club sales increases on certain fixed expenses 
total sg a expenses rose by million from to this increase was due mainly to an increase in the number of clubs in operation in both periods 
payroll and payroll benefits accounted for of all sg a expenses in  and in payroll and payroll benefits accounted for of the increase in total sg a expenses from to the amount of the increase from to contributed by payroll and related benefits was lower than usual  primarily because of lower incentive pay expenses in preopening expenses were million in versus million in we opened thirteen new clubs in and twelve new clubs in one club was relocated in a portion of s preopening expenses was incurred for a new cross dock facility which opened in jacksonville  florida  in april interest income  net was million in versus million in the decrease was due primarily to lower invested cash balances  net of borrowings  resulting mainly from slower inventory turns  treasury stock purchases of approximately million and househome lease obligation payments of approximately million in the last twelve months 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the components of interest income and expense 
we recorded a pretax charge of million in the third quarter of for our estimated loss associated with househome leases 
this loss was based on the present value of rent liabilities under these leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
we also recorded accretion charges of million in connection with these obligations in 
table of contents based on our continuing evaluation of our remaining obligations and the significant progress made in settling liabilities for househome leases  we recorded a million pretax gain in to reduce our estimated liability for contingent lease obligations 
this was partially offset by pretax accretion charges of million recorded in in connection with these obligations

for the full year in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in versus was due mainly to an increase in cash provided by accounts payable of million 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in versus was due principally to payments made to settle househome liabilities and a decrease in cash provided by the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by net income before depreciation and amortization  the net post tax loss on contingent lease obligations  store closing costs and asset impairment losses and the cumulative effect of accounting principle changes was million in versus million in and million in cash expended for property additions was million in versus million in in  we opened ten new clubs and purchased one existing club  which was previously leased 
four of the new clubs opened in were at owned locations 
we also opened a new  square foot owned cross dock facility in jacksonville  florida  in april and refurbished existing clubs during the year 
in  we opened thirteen new clubs and purchased one existing club  which was previously leased 
two of the openings were at owned locations 
we also opened new gas stations in and new gas stations in one gas station was closed in we expect that capital expenditures will total approximately to million in  based on plans to open to new clubs and approximately gas stations 
we expect to refurbish approximately to existing clubs 
the timing of actual club openings and the amount of related expenditures could vary from the estimates above due  among other things  to the complexity of the real estate development process 
we did not repurchase any bj s stock in in  we repurchased  shares of common stock for million  or an average price of per share 
from the inception of its share repurchase activities in august  bj s has repurchased a total of million of common stock at an average cost of per share 
as of january   our remaining repurchase authorization  which has no expiration date  was million 
in january  we assumed a real estate mortgage with a principal balance of  in connection with the purchase of a club that was previously leased 
this debt carries an interest rate of  is payable in monthly installments maturing through november  and has a prepayment penalty 

table of contents we have a million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks which expires june  the agreement includes a million sub facility for letters of credit  of which million was outstanding at january  we are required to pay an annual facility fee which is currently of the total commitment 
interest on borrowings is payable at bj s option either at a the eurodollar rate plus a margin which is currently or b a rate equal to the higher of the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus or the agent bank s prime rate 
we are also required to pay a usage fee in any calendar quarter during which the average daily amount of loans and undrawn or unreimbursed letters of credit outstanding exceeds of the total commitment 
the usage fee  if applicable  would currently be at an annual rate of of the average daily amount of credit used under the facility during the calendar quarter 
the facility fee  eurodollar margin and usage fee are subject to change based upon our fixed charge coverage ratio 
the agreement contains covenants which  among other things  include minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage requirements and a maximum funded debt to capital limitation 
we are required to comply with these covenants on a quarterly basis 
under the credit agreement  we may pay dividends or repurchase our own stock in any amount so long as we remain in compliance with all other covenants 
we have no credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity date of debt if borrowings were outstanding under our credit agreement 
we were in compliance with the covenants and other requirements set forth in our credit agreement at january  and for all fiscal periods throughout the year 
in addition to the credit agreement  we maintain a separate million facility for letters of credit  primarily to support the purchase of inventories  of which million was outstanding at january   and we also maintain a million uncommitted credit line for short term borrowings 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit agreement or our uncommitted credit line at january  and february  increases in inventories and accounts payable from february  to january  were due mainly to the addition of new clubs and an increase of in the average inventory per club in the same time period 
the level of average inventory per club at january  reflects stronger sales trends  some opportunistic year end buys and earlier receipt of spring merchandise  particularly in apparel  as compared to a year earlier 
during the third quarter of  we established reserves for our liability related to leases for three bj s clubs which closed on november  see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our recorded liabilities are based on the present value of rent liabilities under the three leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on estimated borrowing rates for the company that took into consideration the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
pursuant to an agreement with tjx and in connection with househome s filing for bankruptcy on november   we recorded a pretax charge of million for our estimated loss associated with househome leases in based on our continuing evaluation of our remaining obligations and the significant progress made in settling liabilities for househome leases  we recorded pretax gains of million in and million in to reduce our estimated liability related to househome contingent lease obligations 
as of january   we have settled of the househome leases for which we were originally contingently liable  including lump sum settlements for leases 
three other househome properties for which we remain contingently liable have been assigned to third parties 
none of the leases for the three bj s clubs closed in november has been settled or subleased 
we have reserved a total of  associated with our obligations for the remaining leases for two househome stores and three bj s closed clubs as of january  we believe that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements adequately provide for these lease obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual liability for closed store obligations will not differ materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors  including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully sublease  assign or otherwise settle liabilities related to these properties 
we consider our maximum reasonably possible undiscounted pretax exposure for our closed store lease obligations to be approximately million at january  
table of contents bj s has filed proofs of claim against househome  inc for claims arising under certain agreements between bj s and househome in connection with the company s spin off from waban inc in july these claims arise primarily from bj s indemnification of the tjx companies  inc tjx with respect to tjx s guarantee of househome leases and from the tax sharing agreement dated july  between bj s and househome 
househome and bj s have settled bj s claims against househome 
the settlement provides that bj s will have an unsecured claim of approximately million  on account of claims under the tax sharing agreement and indemnification payments which have been made to tjx 
the settlement agreement was approved by the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california on november  househome has stated in its disclosure statement filed with the bankruptcy court that it expects to pay between and of its unsecured claims 
as part of the settlement  bj s has been released of all claims that househome and its bankruptcy estate may have had against bj s  including million owed by bj s to househome under the tax sharing agreement 
we recognized this amount as a reduction in our tax provision in the fourth quarter of in addition  the company and the indenture trustee for househome s convertible subordinated notes have settled bj s claim regarding the priority of amounts owed to bj s 
under the settlement  bj s is entitled to a payment of up to million 
we are unable to determine the amount and timing of any future recoveries under the claims and  therefore  have not recognized such claims in our financial statements 
bj s had no off balance sheet arrangements at any time during the fiscal year ended january  the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of january  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations closed store lease obligations other long term liabilities in the table above  long term debt consists of a real estate mortgage which matures through november  amounts for operating leases reflect future minimum lease payments as disclosed in note e of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have options to renew all but one of our leases 
the table above does not reflect any lease payments we would make pursuant to such renewal options 
approximately of purchase obligations represent future payments for merchandise purchases 
the remainder consists primarily of capital commitments 
amounts for closed store lease obligations comprise our liabilities on the balance sheet at january  for two househome stores and three bj s closed clubs 
timing of payments was based on our estimates of when these liabilities would likely be satisfied through lump sum settlements or through lease payments  net of estimated sublease income 
amounts for other long term liabilities consist mainly of payments for self insured workers compensation and general liability claims and for asset retirement obligations  all of which are included on our balance sheet at january  the estimated timing of payments for insurance claims was based primarily on recent payment 
table of contents experience 
the timing of asset retirement obligation payments corresponds to the end of the estimated useful life assigned to the assets 
not included in other noncurrent liabilities in the table above were payments of million for rent escalation liabilities because they are already included in the operating leases line and deferred revenue of million  which is not a cash obligation 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of january  we believe that our current resources  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to finance our operations through the term of our credit agreement  which expires june  however  we may from time to time seek to obtain additional financing 
factors which could affect future operating results this report contains a number of forward looking statements  including statements regarding planned capital expenditures  planned club and gas station openings  lease obligations under bj s indemnification agreement with tjx  lease obligations in connection with three closed bj s clubs  the effects of implementing eitf  sales penetration of private label products  planned addition of pharmacies and other information with respect to our plans and strategies 
any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  estimates  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause actual events or our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the factors set forth below and other factors noted elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  particularly those noted under critical accounting policies and estimates 
in addition  any forward looking statements represent our estimates only as of the day this annual report was first filed with the securities and exchange commission and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date 
while we may elect to update forward looking statements at some point in the future  we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so  even if our estimates change 
our clubs are located in the eastern united states  primarily in the northeast 
our business may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns in its markets 
in addition  we may be impacted by state and local regulation in our markets and temporarily impacted by weather conditions prevailing in our markets 
we compete with national  regional and local retailers and wholesalers  including national chains in the warehouse merchandising business  some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than bj s  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the company was recently notified by credit card issuers of information suggesting that the company may have been the victim of credit card account data theft 
specifically  bj s was advised that credit and debit card accounts used legitimately at bj s were subsequently used in fraudulent transactions at non bj s locations 
in response  the company retained a leading computer security firm to conduct a forensic analysis of its information technology systems with a goal of determining whether a breach had in fact occurred 
while no conclusive evidence of a breach was found  the computer security firm concluded that the company s centralized computer system that serves as the aggregation point for all bj s credit card transactions chain wide had not been breached and any breach would have likely occurred in a more decentralized fashion involving club level systems 
on march   after the company s receipt of the computer security firm s preliminary report of findings  the company issued a public statement alerting consumers to the potential security breach 
the company has received certain claims relating to this matter that  if successful  would not have a material financial impact on the company
