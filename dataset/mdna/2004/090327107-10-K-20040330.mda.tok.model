critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
revenue recognition we follow american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition sop and statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop  with respect to revenue recognition 
we license our software products primarily under perpetual licenses 
we recognize revenues under these arrangements once the following criteria are met i a written purchase order  license agreement or contract has been executed  ii software  or a software license authorization code in situations where the customer previously received evaluation software  has been delivered to the customer  iii license agreements with no significant vendor obligations or customer acceptance rights outstanding have been issued to the customer  iv the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the fee is probable  and v vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price generally charged when an element is sold separately or at the renewal rate for maintenance agreements in subsequent years 
in situations where vendor specific objective evidence does not exist  and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we do not develop new products under contractual arrangements with customers and do not substantially modify our products and their functionality for specific customers and therefore do not use contract accounting in determining our revenue recognition 
in rare situations when installation is essential to the functionality of the software  revenue is deferred until completion of the installation 
certain of these items may require the application of judgment when evaluating specific business arrangements in a changing environment against our normal business practices 
we do not provide price protection in our customer agreements and generally do not provide conditions of acceptance in sales agreements 
if conditions of acceptance exist  we defer revenue recognition until such acceptance clauses lapse 
if a right of return is granted on a sales transaction  it is generally for a period of days and related return experience has been nominal 
in situations where we grant a day right of return period  revenue recognition is not precluded 
in the few situations were return rights exceed days  revenue recognition is deferred as appropriate 
we have experienced de minimis warranty claims 
we provide customary software warranties indicating the software will conform to published specifications  does not include viruses  back doors  etc  and does not infringe third party intellectual property rights 
to date  we have experienced di minimus warranty claims 
when we make sales through distributors  value added resellers vars  and original equipment manufacturers oems  we recognize revenue after all revenue recognition criteria set forth above are met and after execution of a written purchase order  license agreement or contract with either the reseller or end user 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations and assessments of the financial viability of our customers  including 
table of contents distributors  vars and oems  as we deem necessary in determining whether or not revenue recognition is appropriate 
our service revenues are comprised primarily of maintenance revenue  with much smaller components of revenue from training and consulting services 
maintenance revenue represented approximately  and of total service revenue in  and  respectively 
customers generally elect to purchase a one to three year maintenance agreement in conjunction with their licensing of our products  which is renewable  at the customer s discretion  upon expiration of the original maintenance contract 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term 
training and consulting service revenues are recognized when the training or consulting activities are performed  generally within a few weeks of product installation by the customer 
services  other than maintenance  are of a short term nature and are not provided under multi year contracts 
deferred revenue is comprised primarily of maintenance revenue and revenue from training and consulting services 
the portion of maintenance contract revenues that have not yet been recognized as revenues are reported as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
deferred maintenance revenue which has not been collected is not recognized 
alternative accounting methods are not available for us to select from  however  certain changes in our transaction structures could significantly affect our accounting and minor changes could result in the use of subscription accounting  whereby all revenue related to a transaction would be recognized ratably over an extended time 
stock options we follow accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb in accounting for our employee stock options  which generally provides that no compensation expense is recognized when options are granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value on the date of grant 
we use this method in order to enhance the comparability of our financial statements because it has been used by the majority of technology companies 
an alternative accounting policy available under gaap would be to recognize stock compensation expense based upon the fair value method  which would result in our recognizing significant compensation expense each period 
the fasb has indicated its intention to require use of the fair value method beginning in legislation has recently been introduced to limit the effect of this change 
income taxes we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we may also provide valuation allowances based upon subjective evaluations of facts  circumstances and expectations  which may change over the course of time and may result in significant changes in our tax provision 
accounts receivable and provision for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is considered doubtful 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers as we deem appropriate  review our collection efforts  and analyze our payment experience with specific customers  in order to determine whether or not collection is doubtful 
there may be a significant fluctuation in our provision for doubtful accounts to the extent facts and circumstances change and to our subjective evaluation of the facts  circumstances and expectations change 
restructuring charges restructuring costs are based on our best estimates utilizing information available at the time we commit to the restructuring plans 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our assumptions and estimates utilized in determining 
table of contents costs associated with our restructuring plans 
historically  we have made cost estimates of lease terminations  leasehold abandonments  involuntary employee separations  asset impairments and third party professional fees incurred in connection with restructuring plans 
there may be a significant fluctuation in our estimated restructuring costs to the extent our subjective evaluation of the facts  circumstances and expectations change 
we have made adjustments to our assumptions historically as a result of the deteriorating sublease commercial real estate markets in which we have abandoned leaseholds 
in the fourth quarter of  we revised our estimate of the carrying costs of our abandoned lease space and took a million restructuring charge 
this charge reflected a million payment made to our landlord in december to cancel our lease on two of the three abandoned floors the maximum cancelable under the lease agreement and an increase in our accrual for estimated carrying costs ie  estimated future lease expense less estimated sublease income over the remaining term of the leases associated with the remaining excess floor and other excess office space held by the company 
the estimated carrying costs of the abandoned lease space were determined with the assistance of our leasing agent and were based on an assessment of applicable commercial real estate markets 
the principal variables in estimating the carrying costs are the length of time required to sublease the space  the sublease rate and expense for inducements eg  rent abatement  tenant improvement allowance that may be offered to a prospective sublease tenant 
the accrual at december   for carrying costs of the abandoned lease space totaled million 
while we believe this accrual is adequate  it is subject to adjustment as conditions change 
we will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the accrual and will make the necessary changes to the accrual as conditions warrant results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for were million compared with million in the year over year increase related to a million increase in services revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in license revenues 
license revenues for were million  or percent of total revenues  down from million  or percent of total revenues  in the decline in license revenues primarily related to a million decrease in license revenues from our products for novell based platforms 
the decline in license revenues from our novell related products reflected the maturity  and our high penetration  of the novell market 
we expect revenues from our novell related products will continue to decline in the future and as a result these revenues will become a smaller percent of our overall revenues 
we also expect that the decline in our novell related revenues will be offset by growth in revenues from our other product platforms 
services revenues for were million  or percent of total revenues  up from million  or percent of total revenues  in the increase in services revenues was primarily due to an increase in our installed customer base and a higher focus on consulting services 
we expect our service revenues to increase in the future as a result of our increased install base 
during  revenues from our products for microsoft based platforms totaled million  an increase of percent over revenues from these products accounted for approximately percent of total revenues in  up from percent of total revenues for license revenues for our microsoft related products for were million compared with million in service revenues for our microsoft related products in were million compared with million in we expect revenues from our products and services for microsoft based platforms will continue to grow as a percentage of total revenues 
revenues from our products for novell based platforms for the current year were million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million in  or percent of total revenues 
revenues from these products have continued their decline over the past year  reflecting both the maturity and our penetration of the novell market 
licenses revenues for novell based platforms for were million compared with million in service revenues for novell based platforms in were million compared with million in while we expect our novell revenues will continue to decline in the future  we expect the revenue decline will be modest relative to the declines over the past two years and expect the decline will be offset by higher revenues from our products and services for other platforms 

table of contents sales of our security focused bv control product line accounted for approximately percent of our license revenue in both and sales of our system administration focused bv admin product line accounted for approximately percent of our license revenue in both and no customer accounted for more than percent of our revenues in and revenues recognized from sales to customers outside north america  primarily in europe  accounted for approximately percent of total revenues in compared with percent in gross profit 
gross profit for was million  compared with million for the decline in gross profit resulted from the year over year decrease in license revenues and the slight decline in gross margin 
the gross margin for was percent  compared with percent for the decline in gross margin reflected a shift in business mix toward services revenues  which have a lower gross margin than license revenues 
because resources used to provide services are not segregated by product line  the costs of revenues shipping  technical support  professional services are not tracked and segregated by revenue stream and consequently we do not measure gross profit by product platform ie  microsoft  novell  etc 
we believe there is no material difference in the gross margin by product line 
gross profit generated from license revenue for was million  compared with million for the gross margin from license revenue for was percent  compared with percent for the modest decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the decrease in license revenues in gross profit from services revenue for was million  compared with million for gross margin from services revenue for was percent compared with percent for the decline in gross margin reflected higher personnel costs associated with our technical support and professional services units 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses for totaled million  down from million for these costs include restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in and million in  related to restructuring plans to improve operating efficiency  improve sales and marketing effectiveness  and accelerate our return to profitability 
excluding these charges from both years  our operating costs and expenses were million lower in than the preceding year 
sales and marketing expenses for were million percent of revenues  down from million percent of revenues for  primarily related to actions we took to improve sales efficiency and marketing effectiveness 
because of declining revenues and a weak economic outlook  we completed a major corporate reorganization and implemented a number of cost cutting measures to improve operating efficiency  accelerate our return to profitability and generate positive cash flows from operating activities 
these actions included a downsizing of the sales and marketing departments  which included the closing or downsizing of a number of our foreign sales offices and a reduction in the size of our enterprise sales force  which was focused exclusively on large enterprise transactions 
we also redirected our marketing efforts on enhancing our product marketing capabilities and improving our sales opportunity generation capabilities 
as a result of these efforts and expected future revenue growth  we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be lower in as a result of our initiatives to date to improve operating leverage and sales and marketing effectiveness and anticipated revenue growth 
research and development expenses for were million percent of revenues  down from million percent of revenues in the year over year decrease in r d expenses primarily related to the closing or downsizing of our development offices in boston  massachusetts and arlington  virginia and transferring those activities to our lower cost development centers in houston  texas and pune  india 
we also transferred development responsibilities for certain of our legacy products from houston  texas to pune  india and expect to continue leveraging that development center in the future 
as a result of these initiatives and anticipated revenue growth  we expect future research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative expenses for were million percent of revenues  down from million percent of revenues for we expect future general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues due to anticipated revenue growth 

table of contents restructuring costs were million in  million in and million in restructuring costs in consisted of a million increase in the accrual for carrying costs of abandoned lease space which were accrued as part of our restructuring plans in and and a million charge related to our sales and marketing reorganization plan the restructuring plan 
the million increase in the accrual reflected our decision to i cancel our lease on two of the three abandoned floors the maximum cancelable under the lease agreement  which resulted in a million payment to our landlord in december and ii an assessment of the estimated remaining carrying costs ie  estimated future lease expense  less estimated sublease income over the remaining term of the leases associated with the remaining excess floor in houston and our other excess office space 
the cancellation of two floors resulted in an upward adjustment to our restructuring plan accrual of million  which was partially offset with a reduction to deferred rent expense associated with the canceled space of approximately million 
the assessment of the carrying costs with the remaining excess floor in houston resulted in an upward adjustment to the restructuring plan of million 
restructuring costs in consisted of a million charge for our restructuring plan and a million increase to our accrual for the restructuring plan 
the million adjustment was the result of an increase in the estimated carrying costs for our two floors abandoned as part of the restructuring plan 
the estimated carrying costs of the remaining abandoned lease space were determined with the assistance of our leasing agent and were based on an assessment of applicable commercial real estate markets 
the principal reason for the change in estimate was the continued deterioration of the sublease market for commercial real estate in houston  texas that occurred since the original determinations were made 
the change in estimates primarily related to i a lowering of the expected sublease rate to reflect the drop in rates with minimal expected escalation over the remaining lease term  ii lengthening the time to sublease the abandoned lease space either initially or after the existing sublease expires and iii an increase in expense for inducements eg  rent abatement  tenant improvement allowances  etc 
that potentially would be offered to prospective tenants of the space

additional adjustments to this balance could be required in future periods based on the economic outlook of the real estate market in houston  texas

we also recorded asset impairment charges totaling million during consisting of i a write off of a million equity investment in a uk based software distribution and consulting firm and ii an asset impairment charge of million consisting of million for software and computer equipment and a million impairment of certain intangible assets 
the investment in the uk based software firm was originally made during the second quarter of and consisted of million of redeemable preferred stock in the firm and million of intangible assets  primarily consisting of customer lists and non compete agreements which were being amortized over their useful lives ranging from one to three years 
the write off of the million equity investment  which is included in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss  was based on an independent appraisal of the current fair value of the investment and management s assessment of the value that would be derived from the investment 
the intangible assets had a net book value of million at the date of the impairment after we incurred million and million in amortization expense for the years ending december  and  respectively

 accounting for income taxes 
as in our prior assessments  we considered current and previous performance and other relevant factors in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowance

table of contents general and administrative expenses for were million percent of revenues  down from million percent of revenues for this decrease primarily related to i a million reduction in expenses as a result of our restructuring initiatives in  ii a decline of approximately million in third party consulting fees which were in incurred in to reposition and change our go to market strategy  iii a million decline in sales tax expense which were higher in as a result of increased state tax compliance costs incurred in connection with our expanding geographic operations  and iv a million decline in bad debt expense had included a significant increase in the allowance following an assessment made by our new financial management 
as previously disclosed  during the second quarter of  we recorded a provision for bad debt expense of million 
this provision was the result of an assessment made on the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts after hiring new financial and accounting management new chief financial officer and new corporate controller 
subsequent to the end of and prior to the hiring of new management  during which time we did not have a cfo  we experienced an increase in our past due accounts and a deterioration in our accounts receivable aging and days sales outstanding  which was due  in part  to a less than desired focus on receivable collections  the economic downturn  and the reduction and other changes in sales personnel  particularly in our foreign operations 
the changes in sales personnel  particularly with respect to foreign operations  related to our focus on reducing our net operating loss by eliminating or downsizing underperforming operations 
the changes in sales personnel impaired our collection efforts of certain of the significant past due accounts 
new management conducted a specific account review of all significant past due accounts  a review of our business processes and accounting policies  and an evaluation of the adequacy of the estimates related to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluated the impact on outstanding receivables and the increased risk of collection resulting from changes in the sales force deployment  which consisted primarily of reductions in headcount in underperforming international territories and the elimination of specific us sales personnel and the worsening economic environment 
as a result of the reductions in international territories and the reduced presence in such locations  we perceived increased risk related to the collection of certain foreign outstanding receivables and provided for such receivables accordingly

the write off of the million equity investment was based on an independent appraisal of the current fair value of the investment and management s assessment of the value that would be derived from a future sale 
this software distribution and consulting firm has filed for bankruptcy in the uk in the year over year decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in provision benefit for income taxes

in december  the fasb revised fin and extended the effective date for variable interests created on or before january   to the first quarter of fin significantly changes the criteria used in determining whether entities are consolidated within financial statements 
we expect that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  these effective dates are not applicable to the provisions of paragraphs and of sfas as they apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests  as the fasb has delayed these provisions indefinitely 
the adoption of sfas had no impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have principally related to working capital needs and capital expenditures 
these requirements have been met through a combination of issuances of securities and internally generated funds 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  compared with million at december  the year over year decline included a one time payment of million in december to cancel our lease on approximately two thirds of our excess office space in houston 
other changes netted to a decrease of approximately million 
cash flows used in provided by operating activities were million in and million in the decline in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the million increase in accounts receivable balance resulting from the higher level of sales occurring in the fourth quarter of as compared with the fourth quarter of 
table of contents cash flows used in provided by investing activities were million in and million in the decrease in cash generated from investing activities related to no proceeds generated from the maturity of investments in compared to million in capital expenditures were million in compared with million in the million decline in capital expenditures was due to higher costs incurred during related to our sales force management system 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million in and million in we received approximately million in proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercises of employee stock options 
the major use of cash in financing activities in was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
this use was partially offset by proceeds of million primarily from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our expected principal cash requirements for are i capital expenditures between million and million  primarily for computer and software equipment  ii to meet our working capital requirements  and iii payment of accrued restructuring expenses of approximately million 
we believe that there is sufficient cash on hand to meet these cash requirements  as well as our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
at december   we had no outstanding debt and do not anticipate the need for third party financing during contractual commitments we conduct operations in leased facilities under operating leases expiring at various dates through the remaining contractual obligations under these lease commitments were comprised of the following as of december  contractual obligation total operating leases sub leasing arrangements we have sub leased portions of these facilities under operating leases 
anticipated cash receipts from these executed sub lease arrangements have been taken into account when deriving expected cash outflow on operating lease commitments in the preceding table 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  defined as any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party  under which we have any obligation under a guarantee contract that has any of the characteristics identified in paragraph of fasb interpretation no

proprietary rights see the discussion below under the headings cautionary statements other companies might try to misappropriate our technology and cautionary statements we might be accused of misappropriating a third party s technology 
cautionary statements in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors in particular which are not necessarily in any particular order of importance should be carefully considered when you evaluate bindview and its business 
there may be other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  which could also impair our business operations 
as discussed in more detail below  if one or more of the following risks actually occur  it is possible our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
demand for our products is uncertain in the current economy 
our product sales are significantly concentrated 
we may face future competition from established companies entering our market  and or from consolidated companies 
regulatory compliance costs are likely to increase 
our products could be rendered obsolete by operating system and application program software vendors 
our product sales usually require long lead times 
our quarterly sales are significantly back end loaded  which can lead to uncertainty about meeting expectations and to lower sales prices 
our sales are somewhat seasonal 
our products may not be able to prevail in comparative evaluations against our competitors products 
ongoing refinements to our sales organization may result in transitional inefficiencies 
we do not maintain a significant backlog 
our international sales are subject to certain additional risks 
we are dependent upon continued growth of the market for windows system software 
we are likely to continue to be confronted by rapidly changing markets 
our r d efforts may not be sufficient to keep up with changing markets 
our software could contain errors that are hard to detect and costly to fix 
we could be subject to liability claims if our software has errors 
we rely on certain third party relationships  and our business could be hurt if those relationships were to be impaired 
we license certain third party software for inclusion in our product  and such software may not always be available for our use 
our increasing use of development resources in other countries may present risks 

table of contents our revenue bases may change with the market 
we are affected by the migration rate to windows other companies might try to misappropriate our technology 
we might be accused of misappropriating a third party s technology 
our cost structure is fixed to a certain extent  which may limit our ability to reduce costs if sales decrease 
we may be required to defer increasing amounts of revenue in the future 
our stock price has a history of volatility 
our corporate governance structure includes certain anti takeover provisions 
our network and web site may be targeted for intentional disruption 
natural disasters and other infrastructure problems may hurt our ability to operate 
demand for our products may be uncertain in the current economy 
in the us economy was widely viewed as having entered a recession  which was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september it is unclear whether customers it spending for products like ours will increase 
our product sales are significantly concentrated 
a majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of licenses and maintenance for our vulnerability management software products 
we anticipate these products will account for a majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
if these products become uncompetitive for any reason  our business could be substantially damaged 
although we currently plan to broaden our product line  we cannot be certain we will be able to reduce our product concentration 
we may face future competition from established companies entering our market  and or from consolidated companies 
we expect competition in our market to increase significantly as current competitors expand their product lines and services and as new companies enter the market 
many of these existing and potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including greater resources that can be devoted to the development  promotion and sale of their products  more established sales channels  greater software development experience  and greater name recognition 
in addition  we have noted what appears to be a trend of consolidation in our market through mergers and acquisitions 
for example  symantec corporation acquired axent technologies and thereby began competing with us in one area of our market 
other examples from recent years include quest software s acquisition of fastlane technologies inc and its announced acquisition of aelita software  as well as netiq corporation s mergers with mission critical software and pentasafe  inc this could result in the creation of new competitors and or enhancement of the competitive capabilities of existing competitors 
if these present and future competitors are successful  we are likely to lose market share and our revenue would likely decline 
regulatory compliance costs are likely to increase 
in recent years  the us congress enacted the sarbanes oxley act  moreover  the sec  nasdaq  and financial accounting standards board have adopted and continue to propose implementing rules  regulations  and standards 
these trends are likely to increase our cost of complying with government regulations 
our products could be rendered obsolete by operating system and application program software vendors 
we believe vendors of operating system and application program software we support  particularly microsoft and novell  could enhance their software to include functionality we provide in our own software 
microsoft has a well established track record of successfully entering and competing in markets in which it becomes interested  in recent years  microsoft has publicly announced it intends to focus more intensely on computer and internet related security issues 
if such other vendors were to offer greater functionality than they currently do  then even if our software were clearly better  there would still be a substantial risk many customers would elect to use good enough functionality in the operating system or application program software instead of buying and or continuing to pay maintenance fees for our software 
if this risk were to come to pass  our license and maintenance revenues could be seriously affected 

table of contents our product sales usually require long lead times 
the sales cycles for our products are typically long 
the extended sales cycles are due to a variety of reasons  including but not necessarily limited to the following 
our customers must complete their own internal evaluation and budget approval procedures 
because our software is used in network management  customers often require that several people evaluate the software 
sometimes such people are in different functional and geographic areas and may have different and perhaps conflicting requirements  this can increase the time needed for customer evaluation 
in addition  we have recently expanded our product offerings and have been working to sell more enterprise wide licenses involving multiple bindview products  this likewise can increase the time required for customer review 
some customers intentionally delay purchases for reasons such as budgetary constraints  concerns about the general economy  or a desire to wait until new products are announced  either by us  by our competitors  or by underlying infrastructure vendors such as microsoft or novell 
moreover  in recent years we have experienced longer budget and purchasing review cycles from some of our customers 
our quarterly sales are significantly back end loaded  which can lead to uncertainty about meeting expectations and to lower sales prices 
we generally record a significant portion of our revenues near the end of each fiscal quarter  due in part to customer buying patterns 
many companies negotiate large purchase agreements near the end of the quarter 
we believe these companies expect that by doing so  they can negotiate lower prices and better terms at a time when publicly traded vendors are conscious of the need to make their numbers for the quarter 
in any given quarter  such customer behavior can make it difficult for us to forecast our ability to meet the expectations of investors and analysts 
we may make some end of quarter sales at lower prices than originally offered  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
our sales are somewhat seasonal 
our customers sometimes make significant license and maintenance purchases at the end of the year  possibly because they have budget dollars left and wish to spend those dollars rather than lose them 
in addition  some of our sales compensation policies are based on achievement of certain annual revenue goals 
as a result  our fourth quarter has historically tended to be the strongest in sales  which in turn has meant the following first quarter is often weaker in sales 
our first quarter sales in any given fiscal year do not necessarily indicate we will achieve higher sales in any subsequent quarter 
our products may not be able to prevail in comparative evaluations against our competitors products 
our customers often conduct beauty contests in which they evaluate not only our products but those of our competitors 
we believe our products usually fare very well in such head to head contests  but the possibility always exists that we may lose any given such contest for one or more reasons  some of which may be beyond our control 
for example  if our product does not have a certain functionality that is particularly important to a customer  and if a competitor s product does have such functionality  then we may not be able to win that customer s business 
ongoing refinements to our sales organization may result in transitional inefficiencies 
we are currently refining our sales organization and go to market strategy to increase our ability to support enterprise wide sales 
some of these refinements may require additional training for some of our sales personnel  which can result in temporary inefficiencies as these personnel learn new skills 
we do not maintain a significant backlog 
we normally do not operate with a backlog of product orders because we ship our products shortly after orders are received  and our backlog of services orders is not significant 
consequently  if new product orders were to dry up  we would not be able to cushion the resulting lack of sales with backlog sales 
our international sales are subject to certain additional risks 
if we are unable to recruit or retain qualified sales personnel  distributors  or resellers  that inability could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to generate increased sales using our international sales force  our costs will be higher without corresponding increases in revenue  resulting in lower operating margins for our international operations 
in addition  employment law and policies vary among countries outside the united states  which may reduce our flexibility in managing headcount and  in turn  managing personnel related expenses 
if we do not address the risks associated with international sales in a cost effective and timely manner  our international sales growth will be limited  operating margins could be reduced and our business could be materially adversely affected 
even if 
table of contents we are able to successfully expand our international operations  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
we may be subject to foreign currency risks 
to an increasing extent  our international business likely will be conducted in foreign currencies  especially the euro 
the exchange ratio of foreign currencies for us dollars has fluctuated in the past and is likely to do so in the future  but we cannot predict the extent to which this will happen 
such fluctuations may lead to our experiencing currency losses 
we have not adopted a formal hedging program to protect us from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
we are dependent upon continued growth of the market for windows system software 
we depend upon the success of microsoft s windows and windows xp operating systems  and to a lesser extent on the success of novell s netware operating system and of microsoft s exchange software 
in particular  market acceptance of our products depends on the increasing complexity of these software products and the advantages that our own software provides in managing those products 
there may be times when the growth of one or more of these software products flattens out or even declines  especially if it spending becomes  or stays  generally flat 
to a certain extent  the growth in the windows system software products comes at the expense of the corresponding novell products  meaning that even if we gain customers on the windows side  we may lose customers on the novell side 
we are likely to continue to be confronted by rapidly changing markets 
the markets in which we do business can often be subject to rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands  the emergence of new security threats  and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if new products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to react to  and ideally to anticipate  these changes 
our r d efforts may not be sufficient to keep up with changing markets 
to deal successfully with market changes  we must periodically enhance our existing products  develop and introduce new products  and sometimes discontinue an existing product 
our products are inherently complex  as a result  our new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
when we undertake a project along these lines  we must make resource investments that often are significant in scope 
we may experience various delays and other difficulties in any given project  if that happens  it increases the chances that a competitor might beat us to the market and thereby achieve a potential first to market advantage  this in turn could hinder our efforts to persuade customers to buy our products  which could damage our business 
we have  on occasion  experienced delays in our planned introduction of new or enhanced products and cannot be sure such delays will not occur again 
in short  we cannot be certain  as our market evolves  we will be able to introduce new and or updated products customers will want to buy or continue to use  or if we do  that we will earn enough money to recoup or realize a return on our investments 
our software could contain errors that are hard to detect and costly to fix 
our software products are complex and usually are installed and used in large computer networks having a wide variety of equipment and networking configurations 
we try to test our new products and product enhancements thoroughly and to work with customers through our customer support services organization to identify and correct errors bugs 
even so  we might first become aware of a particular error in a product or product enhancement only after we had released it for general licensing availability 
depending on severity  such errors could cost us substantial time and money to fix  possibly delaying our work on other new products or product enhancements 
in addition  such errors could damage our reputation  possibly hurting our ability to sell not only the product or product enhancement in question but perhaps other products as well 
moreover  the operating system or applicable program software with which our products operate could itself have bugs  this could result in problems being incorrectly blamed on our software  which in turn could result in our having to spend time and money addressing the problems even though they ultimately proved not to have been of our making 
we could be subject to liability claims if our software has errors 
conceivably  errors in our software could lead to warranty claims and or to product liability claims 
such claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims  but it is possible that these provisions may not 
table of contents prove effective in limiting our liability 
any such claims  whether or not ultimately successful  could damage our reputation and our business 
we rely on certain third party relationships  and our business could be hurt if those relationships were to be impaired 
we rely to a considerable extent on our relationships with microsoft and novell  for example  we attempt to coordinate our product offerings with the future releases of their operating systems 
these companies may not notify us of feature enhancements prior to new releases of their operating systems in the future 
in particular  our relationship with novell has been strained in recent years  to the point that in novell declined to renew our premium level membership status in the novell developernet organization 
if our relationship with companies like microsoft and novell were to deteriorate  we might not be able to introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis to capitalize on other companies new releases and feature enhancements 
this could result in portions of our installed base of customers not being able to use our products effectively with these other companies new releases and feature enhancements 
that in turn could lead to one or more of our competitors  having better relationships with these companies  pulling ahead of us in the marketplace 
we license certain third party software for inclusion in our products  and such software may not always be available for our use 
we license certain third party software to perform certain functions in certain of our own software products 
so far we have been able to renew the required licenses on terms we regard as satisfactory 
it is possible that in the future we may not be able to renew one or more of those licenses on acceptable terms 
if that were to occur  we might be forced to stop shipping the affected product s until we could find or build a replacement for the third party software  this could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our increasing use of development resources in other countries may present risks 
we are increasing our use of software development personnel at our indian subsidiary 
political uncertainty in that region of the world  possibly including armed conflict  could interfere with our operations there 
the use by american companies of non us personnel in overseas operations has been the subject of some negative publicity  especially in connection with the upcoming us presidential election 
if federal or state laws were to be changed to restrict the use of non us personnel by us companies  or to further restrict the ability of state and federal agencies to purchase products with significant non us content  our business could be hurt 
our revenue bases may change with the market 
the percentages of our revenues attributable to software licenses for particular operating system or application software platforms can change from time to time 
a number of factors outside our control can cause these changes  including changing market acceptance and penetration of the various operating system and application software platforms we support and the relative mix of development and installation by vars of application software operating on such platforms 
we are affected by the migration rate to windows  windows xp  and microsoft exchange 
our ability to sell licenses for some of our directory migration products depends in part on the rate at which customers elect to migrate their networks to microsoft s windows or windows xp operating system or to microsoft exchange 
other companies might try to misappropriate our technology 
we attempt to protect our technology with a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
we license our software products primarily under click wrap licenses agreements 
we believe  however  these measures afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information we regard as proprietary 
we have found historically that a few customers use our software for more than they have paid for  representing a loss of revenue for us 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect our products and technology from unauthorized copying 
in addition  competitors may be able to independently develop similar or superior technology 

table of contents we might be accused of misappropriating a third party s technology 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is not uncommon in the software industry 
we expect software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we are not aware that we are infringing any proprietary rights of third parties 
from time to time  however  third parties may claim we have infringed on their intellectual property rights 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  could result in costly litigation  could divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays  or could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if a third party alleges we have infringed its intellectual property rights  we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party 
the mere fact a third party makes such an allegation could damage our reputation and hurt our ability to sell our products  and we might have little or no practical recourse even if the allegation is baseless 
if someone were successfully to make a claim of infringement against us  and if we could not or did not obtain a license or develop alternative technology on a timely basis  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our cost structure is fixed to a certain extent  which may limit our ability to reduce costs if sales decrease 
we base our expenses to a significant extent on our estimates of future sales revenues 
as a result  many of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
if our future sales do not match our estimates  we might embark on certain cost cutting measures which could include but are not limited to employee reductions  office closings and product consolidations  but we might not be able to cut costs quickly and effectively enough to prevent our business from being adversely affected 
we may be required to defer increasing amounts of revenue in the future 
as our sales transactions and product mix becomes more complex  revenue recognition principles stated in sop or sop could require us to defer a significant portion of our transaction revenues and to recognize the deferred revenue in future periods  rather than in the period in which the sales transactions occurred 
our stock price has a history of volatility 
there have been times when the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile like that of many other technology companies 
we expect our stock price will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to our company  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  to the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock in recent months  or to factors affecting the computer industry or the securities markets in general 
we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year financial comparisons are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance  nevertheless  if our quarterly and annual operating results should fail to meet market expectations  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively impacted 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future due to a number of factors described elsewhere in this report  which could lead to significant changes in our stock price 
our corporate governance structure includes certain anti takeover provisions 
certain aspects of our corporate governance structure  like that of many other technology companies  are typically regarded as anti takeover provisions 
such provisions likely would make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if the change in control might be beneficial to our stockholders 
this could discourage potential takeover attempts and could hurt the market price of our common stock 
our network and web site may be targeted for intentional disruption 
as a leading provider of security related software  we anticipate that  from time to time  our corporate computer network and our web site may be targeted for intentional disruption by black hat hackers 
we believe we have taken sufficient precautions to prevent such disruption  but we cannot be certain we will succeed in preventing all such disruption 
if such disruption is successful  it could hurt our business activities  if successful disruption becomes publicly known  it could also damage our reputation and that of our products and services 
natural disasters and other infrastructure problems may hurt our ability to operate 
we rely heavily on our telephone system  computer network  and data center infrastructure for internal communications  communications with customers and partners  direct sales of our software products  sales lead generation  and direct 
table of contents provision of fee based services 
those systems may be vulnerable to damage from human error  physical or electronic security breaches  power loss and other facility failures  fire  flooding such as that resulting from tropical storm alison in june  telecommunications failure  sabotage  terrorist attacks such as those of  telecommunications failure  sabotage  terrorist attacks  vandalism and similar events 
despite precautions  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions in our service or significant damage 
in addition  failure of any of our telecommunications providers to provide consistent data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our services and thus in our ability to provide service to our customers

see business special note regarding forward looking statements contained elsewhere herein 
foreign currency exchange rates we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for the years ended december   and  approximately percent  percent and percent of our consolidated revenues  respectively  were generated from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at december   we estimate a near term change in foreign currency rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended december  we used a value at risk var model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur 
interest rate risk we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principal concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on liquid assets 
cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments including restricted cash approximated million and million at december  and  respectively 
such amounts were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold 
we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended december  we used a var model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations
