gross profit margins for merchandise have averaged approximately during the last three years  while gasoline has averaged approximately during the same period 
we seek to meet the needs of convenience customers and maintain a leadership position in the convenience store industry through leveraging our scale  technology  people and widely recognized brand 
in  we will continue to focus on the implementation of our key growth initiatives to improve the operating performance of our company 
merchandise retailing in an effort to meet the changing needs of our customer base  we offer a broad range of products  including many not traditionally available in convenience stores 
these products range from high quality fresh foods delivered daily to unique items that are developed specifically for eleven 

table of contents 
index to financial statements working with outside vendors  eleven s merchandising team continuously focuses on developing and introducing new products in order to increase overall merchandise sales 
we strive for exclusivity from suppliers on these items either for a limited or an extended period to gain a competitive advantage in the convenience channel 
our decision to add a higher quality  freshly prepared sandwich and bakery line  additional roller grill products and new salads reflects our strategy to promote proprietary fresh food products to increase sales 
during  we established a testing center in our austin  texas stores to gauge consumer tastes regarding fresh food products prior to a national rollout 
in  much of the company s radio and television advertising and point of purchase displays will focus primarily on fresh food products 
we believe that the company is well positioned to take advantage of growth in portable fresh foods and that this category will be a key contributor to our long term growth 
we developed a proprietary retail information system that enables our merchandising team  franchisees and store managers to increase sales by enhancing the product mix in each store 
by employing item by item inventory management  stores are better equipped to remain in stock on top selling items  as well as promote new high potential items 
franchisees and store managers are expected to monitor customer buying patterns in their stores to try to maximize their sales through the management of their product assortment 
this strategy  which we call retailer initiative  has contributed to our sustained ability to grow merchandise sales 
growing the services category continues to be one of our priorities 
among the products in the services category are prepaid cards  lottery sales  atm services  and money orders 
additionally  we offer vcom units in approximately  stores 
vcom is our proprietary self service kiosk through which we provide continuously available financial and e commerce services 
available hours a day  vcom offers check cashing  money orders  money transfer  traditional atm services and access to verizon residential telephone services 
we expect to provide additional services  such as phone cards  bill pay  and proprietary stored value cards in we are using market research studies and focus groups to make vcom even more user friendly 
we have seen continued steady transaction growth in the core financial services products since the rollout was completed in the middle of we expect the recent positive trends in the number of transactions will continue in as we further refine our vcom strategy 
gasoline we believe that gasoline sales contribute to increased store traffic 
as a result  we offer gasoline as a convenient product for customers wherever practical 
our gasoline strategy is to be competitively priced to maximize gross profit 
over the last years  we have consistently achieved at or above a cent per gallon level of gasoline gross profit margin 
day to day management of our gasoline business on a store by store basis is driving this steady performance  even in a year like that saw rapid fluctuations in the price of gasoline 
store base eleven is working to optimize the earnings of its store base by opening new stores in strategic locations and closing underperforming stores 
we plan to open approximately stores in our new store development efforts are focused on our existing markets to take advantage of population density and leverage our current distribution capabilities 
we assess new store locations by evaluating demographics  traffic volume  visibility  ease of access  economic activity and population density in the area 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we continue to focus on either improving or closing underperforming stores and have developed a database to track and analyze performance 
in addition  we have created a more structured new site approval process and added a site development management system 
these enhancements are designed to identify the cause of underperformance and to maximize future performance 
during  we intend to continue to upgrade our more mature stores with around million of capital spending related to maintenance and replacement of store equipment 
technology our retail information system provides franchisees  store managers and our management team with timely access to sales information on an item by item basis 
details are captured by a point of sale scanning system at the checkout register 
stores are linked to vendors  our primary third party distributor and our combined distribution centers for ordering and item level information sharing 
effective use of the system is one of the foundations of our business model  allowing franchisees and store managers the ability to manage both their products and time more effectively 
we spent million on technology in the majority of the spending was for enhancements to our retail information system  store process improvements and increased efficiency measures 
during  we introduced improved functionality such as additional alternative payment methodologies  enhancements for ordering and additional support for managing product assortment 
these actions were designed to give store managers more time to run their stores 
to facilitate better communications across the organization  we launched an intranet information packed homepage  upgraded our field consultants laptops and enabled expanded computer based training at the store 
during and  we plan on completing an initiative to upgrade our store systems hardware and the software architecture to a more flexible platform 
employees and franchisees employees and franchisees are critical to implementing eleven s strategies 
we continue to invest in finding and retaining qualified people through focused recruitment efforts  establishment of formal career paths and leadership development programs 
additionally  we are trying to raise the level of performance of our people with advanced training and incentive programs 
we recently implemented new training certification curricula for our field organization and store level employees 
during  we accelerated the pace of training with almost one third of the field support organization completing our certification process 
overall  our effort to upgrade the effectiveness of our store associates has resulted in a two year reduction in store level employee turnover 
we introduced an incentive program that links store performance measurements with eleven s fundamental business concepts 
grading and rewarding the successful execution of the five fundamentals assortment  quality  value  cleanliness and service has gradually improved store ratings over the last two years 
we expect continued improvement in and beyond 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the primary method of implementing our retailer initiative strategy across our store network is through the establishment of model markets 
a model market is comprised of a group of stores where we are employing advanced training  labor saving equipment  and a concentrated focus on merchandising to enable store operators to optimize their product assortment 
the model market rollout will accelerate throughout and we expect to have the program rolled out in all of our markets by the end of we anticipate that it will take between and months to complete the rollout of the model market program 
the early results are promising 
to further align eleven s interests with those of our franchisees  over the past two years we have worked with our franchisees to develop a new franchise agreement 
this agreement combines eleven s strategies regarding fresh foods  combined distribution  and differentiation with franchisees entrepreneurial business approach 
in addition  the new agreement should enhance the company s ability to leverage its scale with additional purchasing power and reduce costs to the stores 
by strengthening the relationship with our franchisees  we should improve profitability for both franchisees and eleven 
to find the best candidates to implement eleven s business model  we are developing a new selection process for franchise candidates 
we believe this will better ensure successful execution of the company s strategy to increase profitability 
trademark we look to increase the value of our licenses by continuing to develop our infrastructure and offering a more attractive financial opportunity to prospective licensees 
the majority of our licensees are international  and our long range plans are to expand the eleven brand into a number of countries where we currently do not have a presence 
as we have previously disclosed  we are exploring additional licensing arrangements in china 
in early  we announced the approval of a joint venture by the ministry of commerce in the people s republic of china to develop eleven stores in beijing and the surrounding area with the first stores expected to open in the spring of critical accounting policies and estimates estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
franchisees we consolidate all merchandise sales and cost of goods sold from stores operated by franchisees with the results of company operated stores 
we split the merchandise gross profit of franchise stores between our franchisees  who have been generally receiving of the gross 
table of contents 
index to financial statements profit  and ourselves 
during  we are beginning to franchise our stores under a new franchise agreement 
the split of the gross profits between the franchisee and us under the new agreement will generally be our share of the merchandise gross profit of franchise stores represents the ongoing royalty 
with regard to gasoline sales  our traditional franchise agreements in most instances require us to pay the franchisee one cent per gallon sold as compensation for the services our franchisees perform related to gasoline 
we have implemented a non contractual policy under which we pay our franchisees the greater of i cents per gallon or ii either  or of the gasoline gross profit  depending upon when the store was franchised 
we can change this policy at any time but have agreed to keep the policy in place for all of the franchisees share of the merchandise and gasoline gross profit is presented as franchisee gross profit expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
if we did not consolidate the franchisee merchandise revenues and cost of goods sold into our consolidated financial results  our net earnings would not change  our consolidated statements of earnings  however  would not reflect any franchise gross profit expense and would reflect significantly lower merchandise revenues and cost of goods sold 
instead  our share of the earnings from franchised stores would be reflected as other income in our consolidated statements of earnings 
see other issues franchise agreement renewal 
we include the franchise stores merchandise sales and cost of sales in our financial statements because we believe that we retain a more significant financial and merchandising advisory role in the franchise business than is present in most other franchisor franchisee relationships 
for example  unlike most franchise models  we own or lease the stores and equipment used by the franchisees as well as provide financing  bookkeeping  advertising  business consulting and other services 
due to this level of involvement and our retention of certain business risks associated with the ownership or leasing of franchised locations and the equipment used by franchisees  we believe that our financial statement presentation appropriately reflects the substance of this combined economic relationship

environmental we accrue for the estimated future costs related to remediation activities at existing and previously operated gasoline storage sites and other operating and nonoperating properties where releases of regulated substances have been detected 
our estimates of the anticipated future costs for remediation activities at such sites are based on our prior experience with remediation sites 
in addition  we consider factors such as the condition of the site contamination  location of tank sites and our experience with contractors who perform environmental assessment and remediation work 
we determine the reserve on a site by site basis and record a liability for remediation activities when it is probable that corrective action will be taken and the cost of the remediation activities can be reasonably estimated 
a portion of the environmental expenditures we incur for remediation activities is eligible for reimbursement under state trust funds and reimbursement programs 
we record a receivable for estimated probable refunds at the same time that we record the liability 
the amount of the receivable is based on our historical collection experience with the specific state fund or other state funds  the financial status of the state fund and our priority ranking for reimbursement from the state fund 
we discount the receivable if the amount relates to remediation activities that have already been completed

 goodwill and other intangible assets  we also conduct an annual impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the impairment test for goodwill includes two steps

increases or decreases in the wholesale cost of gasoline will generally cause similar increases or decreases in the retail price of gasoline 
an increase in the wholesale cost of gasoline generally results in higher retail prices within five to days after the cost increase 
conversely  a decrease in the wholesale cost of gasoline generally results in lower retail prices within to days after the cost decrease 
competitive conditions in the retail marketplace can cause these time periods to vary considerably on a market by market basis  which can have a significant impact on gasoline gross profit margin

we believe that the deployment of these web enabled  integrated services kiosks represents a significant market opportunity to offer financial and e commerce services to a large segment of our current and future customers who have little or no access to banks or the internet 
we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity because of the demographics of our existing customer base and the large number of our conveniently located stores 
through exclusive agreements with third party service providers  we currently offer or plan to offer traditional atm services  money orders and money transfer services  check cashing  prepaid phone cards  auto insurance  stored value cards and bill payment services 
we announced plans in the third quarter of to expand our rollout of vcom to  stores  adding to our original vcom pilot program in texas and florida 
as of december   this expanded rollout was complete 
we funded the million capital investment needed for the vcom rollout primarily through a capital lease program 
as of december   we had million of cash in the vcom kiosks to fund check cashing and atm transaction and money transfer disbursements to customers 
we are currently funding this requirement through our commercial paper program 
during the first quarter of  we expect to enter into an arrangement with a commercial bank that will provide the cash in the vcom kiosks

operating lease obligations and related assets are not included in our consolidated balance sheet 
store leases 
as of december   we operated or franchised a total of  stores in the united states and canada 
we own less than one third of these stores  and we lease the remainder 
over the next five years  leases covering more than half of our total leased stores will expire  including more than  leases that lack rent renewal options or contain negotiable rent options and more than  leases that have fixed rent options 
we have devoted  and will continue to devote  considerable efforts to extending and or renegotiating these leases 
total lease expiring or with negotiable rent options fixed rent options total we originally signed many of the expiring leases or leases with negotiable options in the s and s 
some of these leases had primary terms of to years  with as many as three options to renew for additional five year terms 
for those sites where we need to negotiate a a new lease to replace an expiring lease or b a new rental for those leases that have negotiable rent renewal options  we expect that we will pay prevailing market rates when the new lease term or option term commences  which will likely significantly increase our operating costs 
if we are unable to agree on an appropriate rent for any one of these stores  we may decide to forego renewal of the lease and close the store

pursuant to a licensing arrangement 
we have been pursuing the possibility of entering into a licensing arrangement for the greater beijing market area with a joint venture that was originally formed by sej  president chain store corporation and two chinese participants 
president chain store corporation is our current licensee in taiwan  where it operates approximately  stores  and seven eleven japan is our current licensee in japan  where it operates approximately  eleven stores 
we have focused on the possibility of negotiating a licensing arrangement with sej and president chain store corporation because of their financial strength  business experience in china and proven ability to develop and operate eleven stores 
because sej  together with iy and iyg holding  owns approximately of our common stock  our board of directors appointed a special committee of three directors  none of whom is affiliated with sej  iy or any of the proposed joint venture partners  to review and consider the proposed licensing arrangement for approval 
during the third quarter of  the special committee approved the essential financial terms for the licensing arrangement with the joint venture 
in addition  the committee authorized us to proceed to negotiate the other terms and conditions of an area license agreement  which the committee will then review and consider for final approval 
during the first quarter of  the ministry of commerce in the people s republic of china approved the formation of a joint venture among sej  beijing shoulian commercial group co  ltd  and china national sugar alcohol group corporation

the first stores are expected to open in the spring of environmental at december   our estimated undiscounted liability for our environmental costs related to remedial action at existing and previously operated gasoline storage sites and other operating and nonoperating properties where releases of regulated substances have been detected was million 
we anticipate that substantially all of the future remediation costs for detected releases of regulated substances at remediation sites of which we are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements aware  as of december   will primarily be incurred within the next five to six years 
the estimated liability could change within the near future for several reasons  including a revisions to or the creation of governmental requirements  b existing remediation projects become fully defined  resulting in revised estimates of the cost to finish the projects and c unplanned future failures of underground gasoline storage tank systems 
under state reimbursement programs  we are eligible to be reimbursed for a portion of future remediation costs  as well as a portion of remediation costs previously incurred 
at december   we had recorded a net receivable of million for the estimated state reimbursements  of which million relates to remediation costs incurred in the state of california 
in assessing the probability of state reimbursements  we take into consideration each state s fund balance  revenue sources  existing claim backlog  status of cleaning activity and claim ranking 
as a result of these assessments  the recorded receivable amounts at december   are net of allowances of million 
the estimated future state reimbursement amounts could change within the near future as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be revised or extended 
while we cannot be certain of the timing of our receipt of state reimbursement funds  based on our experience we expect to receive the majority of state reimbursement funds within one to three years after our payment of eligible remediation expenses 
this time period assumes that the state administrative procedures for processing such reimbursements have not changed 
the exception to our assumption regarding the timing of when we will receive state reimbursement funds is in california 
the california reimbursement program separates claims into four classes a  b  c and d 
our claims are in class d 
as a result of the growing backlog of class d claims and its impact on our estimate of when we will receive funds from the california reimbursement program  we recorded a pretax charge to osg a of million in the third quarter of to reflect our best estimate of the fair value of our california remediation receivable 
we have recorded the portion of the receivable that relates to remediation activities that have already been completed at a discount rate of approximately 
thus  in addition to the allowance discussed above  the recorded receivable amount is also net of a discount of million 
any revisions to our estimated future remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could have a material impact on our operations and financial position

 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  requires that changes in relevant law be considered in current measurement of postretirement benefit costs 
however  certain accounting issues related to the federal subsidy remain unclear and significant uncertainties may exist that impair a plan sponsor s ability to evaluate the direct effects of the new law and the effects on plan participants behavior and healthcare costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion summarizes the financial and derivative instruments we held as of december  these instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
from time to time  we use interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
in addition  our two yen denominated loans effectively serve as an economic hedge of our exposure to yen dollar currency fluctuations resulting from our significant yen based royalty from sej 
we do not leverage the instruments we hold  and we hold the instruments for purposes other than trading 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as country risk  credit risk and legal risk  and we have not addressed these risks in this discussion 
interest rate risk management we enter into interest rate swaps to achieve the levels of variable and fixed rate debt approved by senior management 
under the interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts on a quarterly basis 
we had one outstanding interest rate swap at december   with a negative fair value of million 
the fair value represents the estimated amount we would have paid if we had chosen to terminate the swap as of december  the swap expired in february we have no other interest rate swaps in place 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   approximately of our debt contained floating rates that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate for such debt  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  foreign exchange risk management our million of royalty income in was impacted by fluctuating exchange rates 
approximately of such royalties were from area license agreements with sej 
although sfas no 
nullified the hedge accounting treatment we were applying to the sej royalty and our yen denominated loans  we continue to have an economic hedge by using the sej royalty receipts to make principal and interest payments on our yen denominated loans 
however  since january   we have adjusted the balance of the yen loans at each reporting date to reflect the current japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate  and the resulting foreign currency exchange gain or loss is recognized in earnings 
based on our yen denominated debt balance as of december   a one point increase or decrease in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate would result in an increase or decrease in pretax earnings of approximately million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates yen loans and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are exposed to fluctuating exchange rates on the portion of our royalties earned in foreign currencies that are not attributable to our license agreement with sej  but we do not believe future risk is material based on current estimates 
we also have certain wholly or partially owned foreign subsidiaries and are susceptible to exchange rate risk on earnings from these subsidiaries  based on current estimates  however  we do not consider future foreign exchange risk to be material
