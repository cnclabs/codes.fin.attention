 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fasb has tentatively concluded that companies could adopt the new standard in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method and the modified retrospective transition method 
using the modified prospective transition method  a company would recognize share based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date 
using the modified retrospective method  a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of the proposed standard in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 that is  an entity would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with sfas no 
a company would not be permitted to make any changes to those amounts upon adoption of the proposed statement unless those changes represent a correction of an error and are disclosed accordingly 
for the periods after the date of adoption of the proposed standard  the modified prospective transition method described above would be applied 
the fasb expects to issue the final standard by december  the company continues to evaluate the impact the final standard will have on the company s results of operations and financial statements

inflation the company strives to reflect the inflationary impact of materials  labor and other operating costs and expenses in its prices 
the market for the services and products that the company offers  however  is highly competitive  and in some cases has limited the ability of the company to offset inflationary cost increases 
forward looking statements certain matters contained in this report are forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the information contained under the heading outlook for fiscal in item of this report and statements concerning the development and introduction of new technologies  the adaptability of osl to new platforms and new formats such as inlight  the usefulness of older technologies  the cost associated with the company s business development and research efforts  the valuation of the company s long lived assets or business units relative to future cash flows  the anticipated results of the company  the company s business plans  foreign exchange risks  government regulations  changes in postal and delivery practices  the company s market position  anticipated revenue and cost growth  the risks of conducting business internationally  other anticipated financial events  the effects of changing economic and competitive conditions  government regulations  accreditation requirements  and pending accounting announcements 
such assumptions may not materialize to the extent assumed and such risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ from anticipated results 
such risks and uncertainties may also result in changes to the company s business plan and prospects and could create the need from time to time to write down the value of the assets or otherwise cause the company to incur unanticipated expenses 
additional information may be obtained by reviewing the information set forth below under significant risk factors and information contained in the company s reports filed from time to time with the sec 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec issued statements regarding disclosure by companies within their management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in those statements  the sec encouraged companies to identify critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the company recognizes revenues and the related costs for its services in the periods for which such services are provided 
many customers pay for these services in advance 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheet represent customer deposits invoiced in advance during the preceding twelve months for services rendered over the succeeding twelve months  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september   are included in deferred contract revenue  and are stated net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates 
management believes that the amount of deferred revenue shown at the respective consolidated balance sheet dates fairly represents the level of business activity it expects to conduct with customers invoiced under this arrangement 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgments and estimates are utilized in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of the company s accounts receivable balances may become uncollectable 
specifically  management analyzes accounts in relation to receivable aging trends  economic factors  and changes in customer payment history in establishing this allowance 
accounts receivable  reduced by this allowance of  as of september  and  as of september   amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september  property  plant equipment plant and equipment including dosimetry badges and software are recorded at cost and are depreciated amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily thirty years for buildings and three to eight years for equipment 
landauer assesses the carrying value of its property  plant and equipment and the remaining useful lives whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger this review included competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
landauer capitalizes internal software costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and such costs amounted to  and  respectively  for fiscal and fiscal goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets are comprised of goodwill  purchased customer lists  licenses and patents 
on october   the company adopted sfas no 
which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer be amortized to earnings  but be reviewed periodically for impairment 
for acquisitions completed prior to june   the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets has ceased beginning in fiscal year under sfas  the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized must be based generally on fair values 
as a result of applying the impairment provisions of sfas no 
 no impairment loss was required 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily ten years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
such review is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and an assessment of fair value based on discounted cash flows or other indicators of fair market value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk significant risk factors the company s business and operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
as discussed in note to the financial statements in this annual report on form k  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements  the financial statements of the company s non us subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the us dollar as the functional currency 
to date  the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has not been material in relation to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
these risks could increase  however  as the company expands in international markets 
the company does not have any significant trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable  or commitments in a currency other than that of the reporting unit s functional currency 
as such  the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure in its non us operations 
reliance upon single manufacturing facility landauer  inc conducts its primary manufacturing and laboratory processing operations from a single facility in glenwood  il 
in addition  the company performs significant functions for some of its international operations from the glenwood facility 
if the company were to lose availability of its primary facility due to fire  natural disaster or other disruptions  the company s operations could be significantly impaired 
although the company maintains business interruption insurance  there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such insurance would be sufficient to offset any loss the company might incur or that the company would be able to retain its customer base if operations were so disrupted 
single source for crystal materials crystal material is a key component in landauer s osl technology 
the company operates a single crystal manufacturing facility in stillwater  oklahoma that currently supplies all osl crystal radiation measurement material used by the company 
if the company were to lose availability of its stillwater facility due to a fire  natural disaster or other disruptions  such loss could have a material adverse effect on the company and its operations 
although multiple sources for raw crystal material exists  there can be no assurance that the company could secure another source to produce finished crystal materials to landauer s specification in the event of a disruption at the stillwater facility 
technology landauer s technological expertise has been an important factor in its growth 
the company regularly pursues product improvements to maintain its technical position 
the development and introduction of new technologies  the adaptability of osl to new platforms and new formats  the usefulness of older technologies as well as the introduction of new technologies by the competition present various risks to the company s business 
the failure or lack of market acceptance of a new technology or the inability to respond to market requirements for new technology could adversely affect the company s operations or reputation with customers 
the cancellation of technology projects or the cessation of use of an existing technology can result in write downs and changes to the company s earnings 
in the normal course of its business  landauer must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately and relies on various computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems 
any failure of such equipment or systems could adversely affect the company s operations 
international operations pose risks landauer conducts business in numerous international markets such as japan  france  the united kingdom  brazil  canada and china 
foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks  including among others  currency exchange rate fluctuations  disruption in relations  political and economic unrest  trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation  and changes in laws and policies  including those governing foreign owned operations 
government regulations regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting the company s business 
the radiation monitoring industry is subject to federal and state governmental regulation 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect landauer s business or operations in the future and or could increase the cost of compliance 
many of the company s technology based services must comply with various national and international standards that are used by regulatory and accreditation bodies for approving such services and products 
changes in these standards and accreditation requirements can result in the company having to incur costs to adapt its offerings and procedures 
such adaptations may introduce quality assurance issues during transition that need to be addressed to ensure timely and accurate analyses and data reporting 
additionally  changes affecting radiation protection practices  including new understandings of the hazards of radiation exposure and amended regulations  may impact how the company s services are used by its customers and may in some circumstances cause the company to alter its products and delivery of its services 
competition the company competes on the basis of advanced technologies  competent execution of these technologies  the quality  reliability and price of its services and its prompt and responsive performance 
in much of the world  radiation monitoring activities are conducted by a combination of private entities and governmental agencies 
the company s primary competitor in the united states is large and has substantial resources 
the company also faces competitive pressures from a number of smaller competitors 
compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act the company is in the process of documenting and testing its internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  that requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments due to be completed by september  we are in the process of documenting and testing our system of internal controls to provide the basis for our report 
however  at this time  due to the ongoing evaluation and testing  no assurance can be given that there may not be internal control deficiencies that would be required to be reported
