item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to the following discussion should be considered in light of the statements under the heading safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of  at the end of this item 
all capitalized terms used in this item that are not defined in this item have the meanings given to them in the notes to consolidated statements contained in item a of this form k 
total revenues for were  a decrease of  or from  in results of operations for reflect the effects of the services agreement and the reinsurance pooling agreement among the company  its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  mnh  and mutual  effective january  the services agreement calls for mutual to provide underwriting  administrative  claims and investment services to the company and mnh 
the reinsurance pooling agreement provides for the pooling  or sharing  of insurance business traditionally written by mutual and mnh on or after the effective date 
mnh s share of pooled combined mutual and mnh premiums earned and losses and loss adjustment expenses lae for in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement was 
direct premiums written by mnh or mutual are not pooled 
mnh s pooling percentage will be in though not to exceed  in assumed net premiums  and in  though not to exceed  in assumed net written premiums 
mnh s share of pooled premiums will be reduced to in and  though not to exceed  and  in net written premiums  respectively 
mnh did not participate in a pooling agreement in and therefore the results of operations for reflect business written independently by mnh 
this analysis provides a comparison of the company s share of pooled premiums for to unpooled premiums for the same period in  as well as a comparison of the pooled  or combined mutual and mnh  premiums written for to the combined business of mutual and mnh for the same period in  even though the companies were not party to a reinsurance pooling agreement in total combined mutual and mnh or group wide direct premiums dwp written for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or from  in the company s pro forma share of combined direct premiums written in  in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement  was  the company recorded  of direct premiums written in the table below shows a comparison of direct premiums written by major category in and mnh pooled mnh group wide dwp share dwp year ended year ended december  december  variance variance s omitted s omitted voluntary personal lines     voluntary commercial lines     involuntary     total direct written premiums     the decrease in group wide voluntary personal lines direct premiums written resulted from a decrease in private passenger automobile ppa direct premiums written  somewhat offset by a increase in homeowners direct premiums written 
the decrease in ppa direct premiums written is the result of the group s policy  implemented in  not to write new policies in certain jurisdictions and from the approval of the group s plan to withdraw from the new jersey ppa market by the new jersey department of banking and insurance which was effective in june as a result  voluntary ppa policies in force at december  were  a decrease of  or from  at december  the increase in group wide voluntary commercial lines direct premiums written  resulted from a increase in average premium per commercial lines policy  somewhat offset by a decrease in commercial lines policies in force 
a average increase in commercial lines premium rates contributed to the increase in average premium per commercial lines policy 
the decrease in group wide involuntary written premiums  which consist primarily of involuntary ppa insurance  resulted primarily from a decrease in group wide assignments from the new york automobile insurance plan nyaip which amounted to  in as compared to  in the nyaip provides coverage for individuals who are unable to obtain auto insurance in the voluntary market 
assignments from the nyaip vary depending upon a company s ppa market share and the size of the nyaip 
the company is unable to predict the volume of future assignments from the nyaip 
in order to minimize the adverse impact of assignments from the nyaip  the company purchased territorial credits from an unaffiliated insurance company pursuant to section a of the nyaip manual 
the credits against nyaip assignments were generated by the other insurance company for writing ppa business in certain localities in new york with ppa market availability problems 
the other insurance company  by nature of its concentration in ppa business in credit territories  generated more credits than it required to offset its nyaip assignments 
the credits purchased reduced the company s share of the nyaip 
the company believes that the costs of the credits purchased  which are pooled in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement  were substantially less than the amount the company would have lost had it written the additional nyaip business 
group wide pooled net premiums written for were  a decrease of  or from  for this decrease resulted from the increase in group wide direct premiums written  offset by an increase in as compared to  of reinsurance premiums ceded to third parties 
the company s share of pooled net premiums written in in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement was  a decrease of  or from its unpooled net premiums written of  in the company s share of pooled net premiums earned in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement for was  net premiums earned in were  the decrease in net premiums earned primarily resulted from the decreases in net premiums written in and had mnh s share of pooled premiums earned in been mnh s share for  earned premiums for would have been  net investment income was  in  a decrease of  or from  in the average pre tax yield associated with the investment portfolio decreased basis points to in compared to average invested assets for decreased from the year earlier period 
net realized investment gains were  
per fully diluted share after taxes in compared to  
per fully diluted share after taxes in a majority of the amount  resulted from the company taking advantage of a share repurchase program related to an otherwise illiquid security 
other revenues were  in  a decrease of  or from  in  primarily due to a  or decrease in service fee income 
net losses and lae were  for  a decrease of  or from  for this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in net premiums earned 
the loss and lae ratio was for compared to for the company recorded decreases to its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years of  and  in and  respectively 
these decreases in losses and lae relating to prior accident years reduced the loss and lae ratio in and by 
and percentage points  respectively 
the decrease recorded in was primarily the result of favorable loss development related to known claims on workers compensation policies 
the following table documents the changes in the estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years recorded in for the company s major lines of business commercial workers accident home ppa auto compen commercial general all year owners liability liability sation package liability other total prior to increases decreases in thousands total     the company s reduction in its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years represented less than of the recorded reserve for losses and lae at december   calculated on a statutory accounting practices basis 
during  both paid and incurred losses and lae emerged at amounts that were greater than anticipated when reserves for loss and lae were estimated and recorded at december  for the workers compensation and general liability lines of business 
this unfavorable emergence was offset by lower than anticipated loss and lae emergence in the company s ppa liability particularly for accidents occurring in and commercial auto liability line of business 
the company made no changes to the key assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of its reserves for losses and lae during a reasonable possibility exists in any year that relatively minor fluctuations in the estimate of reserves for losses and lae may have a significant impact on the company s net income 
this is due primarily to the size of the company s reserves for losses and lae  at december  relative to its net income 
involuntary automobile insurance business increased the company s calendar year loss and lae ratio by approximately and percentage points for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the combined ratio on involuntary automobile business was greater than the combined ratio on voluntary automobile business 
the ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned was in both and an increase in the premium tax rate in new york state  which is discussed in the following paragraph  added 
percentage points to the company s ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned in the period 
other underwriting expenses for included  of retrospective commission income to be received from mutual in accordance with the reinsurance pooling agreement 
this retrospective commission income reduced the ratio of deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned by 
percentage points 
other underwriting expenses also included  related to the purchase of territorial credits against nyaip assignments discussed earlier in this item  which added 
percentage points to the ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned 
there were no such credits purchased in commissions  premium taxes and other state assessments that vary directly with the company s premium volume represented of net premiums earned in and in the provision for income taxes for includes the effect of a may change in new york state law with respect to the taxation of non life insurance companies 
this change eliminated state income taxes for all non life insurance companies and increased the premium tax rate from to 
this change in new york state law lowered the company s effective income tax rate by approximately percentage points in further  as a result of this change  the company reduced its deferred tax liability with respect to new york state income taxes to during this one time benefit reduced the company s effective income tax rate for by percentage points 
in addition  tax exempt income reduced the company s effective income tax rate by and percentage points  respectively  for the years ended december  and compared to total revenues for were  a decrease of  or from  in direct premiums written for were  a decrease of  or  from  for voluntary direct premiums written for were  a decrease of  or from  for voluntary personal lines direct premiums written for were  a decrease of  or from  in private passenger automobile direct premiums written  which comprised and of total voluntary personal lines direct premiums written in and  respectively  decreased in compared to this slight decrease in voluntary personal lines direct premiums written is due to rate increases implemented in some territories being more than offset by the effect of the company s decision not to accept new ppa applications effective april  in certain states where the company intends to reduce its ppa exposures due to unfavorable market conditions 
ppa new business units ppa policies written by the company for the first time decreased to  in from  in as a result  total voluntary ppa policies in force at december  decreased to  from  at december  homeowners direct premiums written  which comprised and of total voluntary personal lines direct premiums written in and  respectively  increased to  in from  in voluntary commercial lines direct premiums written for were  a decrease of  or  from  for total commercial lines new business units in decreased compared to total commercial lines policies in force decreased to  at december  from  at december  direct premiums written decreased for every commercial line of business in compared to the decrease in voluntary commercial lines direct premiums written is consistent with the actions undertaken by the company in the fourth quarter of to exit certain classes of commercial insurance  thereby reducing direct premiums written in business segments that it believes do not provide the opportunity to earn a satisfactory return 
mutual exited most of the same classes of commercial insurance at the same time and in the same jurisdictions as the company 
the company believes that a portion of the decrease in voluntary commercial lines direct premiums written was due in part to some commercial business  other than in exited classes and related policies  moving to other insurance carriers 
involuntary direct premiums written  primarily involuntary ppa insurance  which comprised and of total direct premiums written in and  respectively  were  for compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased assignments from the nyaip 
net premiums written decreased  or to  for from  for  primarily due to the decrease in direct premiums written 
net premiums earned for were  a decrease of  or  from  in the decrease in net premiums earned resulted from the decrease in net premiums written 
the decrease in net premiums earned was smaller than the decrease in net premiums written since the company s insurance policies generally earn over a twelve month policy term 
net investment income was  in  a decrease of from  in the average pre tax yield associated with the investment portfolio decreased basis points to for  due to lower available reinvestment rates 
average invested assets for decreased compared to net realized investment gains were  for compared to net realized investment losses of  for during the fourth quarter of  the company sold its entire investment in a real estate investment trust and recorded a realized loss on the transaction of  the market value of this security was equal to the proceeds from the sale of  this security was purchased in and had performed to expectations from the time of purchase until the fourth quarter of the company believed that a proposed change in ownership of the trust was not in the best interest of the company or of other preferred owner interests and as a result concluded that the risks inherent in holding the investment were greater than the loss recorded from its sale 
no other unrealized losses were recorded through income 
other revenues  which are comprised primarily of service fee income reduced by premium receivable charge offs  were  for  a decrease of  or  from  for net losses and lae were  for  a decrease of  or from  for the loss and lae ratio decreased to for from for incurred losses for included  of losses and lae related to the september  terrorist attack on the world trade center wtc event in new york city  which added percentage points to that year s loss and lae ratio 
without the effect of the wtc event  the company s loss and lae ratio for would have been 
the company recorded decreases to its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years of  and  in and  respectively 
these decreases in losses and lae relating to prior accident years reduced the loss and lae ratio in and by and percentage points  respectively 
the decrease recorded in was primarily the result of favorable loss development related to known claims on workers compensation policies 
the following table documents the changes in the estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years recorded in for the company s major lines of business commercial workers accident home ppa auto compen commercial all year owners liability liability sation package other total prior to increases decreases in thousands total      the company s reduction in its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years represented of the recorded reserve for losses and lae at december  calculated on a sap basis 
during  both paid and incurred losses and lae emerged at amounts that were less than anticipated when reserves for loss and lae were estimated and recorded at december   particularly for the commercial auto liability and the workers compensation lines of business 
greater than anticipated loss and lae emergence in the company s ppa liability line of business  particularly for accidents occurring in  somewhat offset the favorable emergence noted on other lines of business 
the company made no changes to the key assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of its reserves for losses and lae during a reasonable possibility exists in any year that relatively minor fluctuations in the estimate of reserves for losses and lae may have a significant impact on the company s net income 
this is due primarily to the size of the company s reserves for losses and lae  at december  relative to its net income 
involuntary automobile insurance business increased the company s calendar year loss and lae ratio by approximately and percentage points for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the combined ratio on involuntary automobile business was greater than the combined ratio on voluntary automobile business 
the ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned increased to in from due to the percentage decrease in net premiums earned being greater than the percentage decrease in other underwriting expenses 
expenses that vary directly with the company s premium volume  primarily commissions  premium taxes and state assessments  represented and of net premiums earned in and  respectively 
other underwriting expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits and other operating expenses vary indirectly with premium volume and comprise the remainder of the company s expenses 
the company s effective income tax rate increased to in from in primarily due to a reduction in the tax benefits associated with tax exempt investment income and the dividends received deduction 
critical accounting policies reserve for losses and lae loss and lae reserves are established for known claims based on the type and circumstance of the loss and the results of similar losses 
for claims not yet reported to the company  loss reserves are based on statistical information from previous experience periods adjusted for inflation  trends in court decisions and economic conditions 
lae reserves are intended to cover the ultimate cost of investigating all losses that have occurred and defending lawsuits  if any  arising from these losses 
lae reserves are evaluated periodically using statistical techniques which compare current costs with historical data 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 
the company s reserving process is based on the assumption that past experiences  adjusted for the effect of current developments and trends  are relevant in predicting future events 
in the absence of specific developments  the process also assumes that the legal climate regarding the claims process and underlying liabilities remains constant 
other assumptions employed by the company or its actuarial firm change from time to time as circumstances change 
in estimating loss and lae reserves the company employs a number of actuarial methods  depending on their applicability to each line of business  in order to balance the advantages and disadvantages of each method 
therefore  a range of estimates is developed for each line of business 
however  the company does not believe it is appropriate to sum the high and low values developed using different actuarial methods for each line of business to determine a range for the company s total loss and lae reserves 
therefore the company s actuary and its consulting actuary only provide the company with their respective best estimates of total loss and lae reserves by summing their best estimate for each line of business 
due to the company s small size  the presence or absence of a limited number of moderate losses  as well as the timing of the reporting of such losses to the company by claimants could result in changes in actuarial estimates that are significant to the company s net income for a quarter or a year 
as such  management recognizes that the best estimate may not be more accurate than other amounts within a few percentage points of total loss and lae reserves 
the company has recorded changes in reserves for prior accident year losses in most years 
in and  the company decreased its reserves for prior years by  and  respectively 
the total reserves for losses and lae were  and  at december  and  respectively 
deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premiums taxes and certain underwriting expenses relating to issuance of customer policies are deferred and amortized ratably over the related contract period 
such deferred acquisition costs are limited to their estimated realizable value 
when estimating realizable value  the company considers the premiums to be earned and estimates the loss and lae to be incurred 
actual amounts realized may vary from the company s estimates 
investments fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
net realized holding gains or losses  net of taxes  are shown as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
the company s investment committee  comprised of the chief operating officer  the chief investment officer and the chief financial officer  meets monthly and monitors the company s investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
the investment committee considers the nature of the investment  the severity and length of the decline in fair value  events specific to the issuer including valuation modeling and overall market conditions 
when a security has been determined to have a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  the company adjusts the cost basis of that security to fair value 
a charge to earnings is recorded as a realized loss 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income 
liquidity and capital resources in developing its investment strategy the company determines a level of cash and short term investments which  when combined with expected cash flow  is estimated to be adequate to meet expected cash obligations 
historically  the excess of premiums collected over payments on claims  combined with cash income from investments  has provided the company with short term funds in excess of normal operating demands for cash 
due to declining written and collected premiums however  the company s operating activities have resulted in a use of cash each year since the company s decreasing participation percentage with respect to the pooled business over the remaining years of the reinsurance pooling agreement will likely result in future negative cash flows from operations 
net cash used in operations was  in had mnh s share of pooled earned premiums and losses and lae been mnh s share for  net cash used in operations would have been approximately  the company believes that careful management of the relationship between assets and liabilities will minimize the likelihood that investment portfolio sales will be necessary to fund insurance operations  and that the effect of any such sale on the company s stockholders equity will not be material 
the company s objectives with respect to its investment portfolio include maximizing total return within investment guidelines while protecting policyholders surplus and maintaining flexibility 
like other property and casualty insurers  the company relies on premiums as a major source of cash  and therefore liquidity 
cash flows from the company s investment portfolio  either in the form of interest or principal payments  are an additional source of liquidity 
because the duration of the company s investment portfolio is shorter than the duration of its liabilities  increases or decreases in market interest rates are not expected to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  or its results of operations 
at december   the company owned investment securities of which had unrealized losses 
as of december  all of the company s fixed maturity investments were exchange traded or are readily marketable and are supported by the broker dealer community 
the company did not record any other than temporary investment impairments during the total potential impact on the company s future earnings and on its financial position if the unrealized losses associated with its investment portfolio at december  were to become other than temporary would be  or  after taxes 
at december    or of the company s investment portfolio was invested in non investment grade securities 
at december    or of the company s investment portfolio was invested in non investment grade securities 
the company designates newly acquired fixed maturity investments as available for sale and carries these investments at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to these investments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
at december   the company recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in its consolidated balance sheet  of net unrealized gains  net of taxes  associated with its investments classified as available for sale 
at december  the company s portfolio of fixed maturity investments represented of invested assets 
management believes that this level of bond holdings is consistent with the company s liquidity needs because it anticipates that cash receipts from net premiums written  investment income and maturing securities will enable the company to satisfy its cash obligations 
furthermore  a portion of the company s bond portfolio is invested in mortgage backed and other asset backed securities which  in addition to interest income  provide paydowns of bond principal 
at december    or  of the company s fixed maturity portfolio was invested in mortgage backed and other asset backed securities 
the company invests in a variety of collateralized mortgage obligation cmo products but has not invested in the derivative type of cmo products such as interest only  principal only or inverse floating rate securities 
all of the company s cmo investments have a secondary market and their effect on the company s liquidity does not significantly differ from that of other fixed maturity investments 
the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during at december  the company was holding  shares in treasury 
the company maintains a  unsecured credit facility from a bank 
any borrowings under this facility are payable on demand and carry an interest rate which can be fixed or variable and is negotiated at the time of each advance 
this facility is available for general working capital purposes and for repurchases of the company s common stock 
no amounts were outstanding related to this facility at december  as a holding company  the company is dependent upon cash dividends from mnh to meet its obligations and to pay any cash dividends 
mnh is subject to new hampshire insurance laws which place certain restrictions on its ability to pay dividends without the prior approval of state regulatory authorities 
these restrictions limit dividends to those that  when added to all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months  would not exceed of the insurer s policyholders surplus as of the preceding december st 
the maximum amount of dividends that mnh could pay during any twelve month period ending in without the prior approval of the new hampshire insurance commissioner is  mnh paid  of dividends to the company in dividend payments of  were made in april and november the company paid a quarterly cash dividend to its common stockholders of 
per share in  which amounted to  regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to its statutory surplus should not exceed to the company has consistently followed a business strategy that would allow mnh to meet this to regulatory guideline 
mnh s ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus for was to contractual obligations at december   the company had no contractual obligations related to long term debt  capital leases  operating leases  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities reflected on its balance sheet

federal legislation the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  signed into law on november   provides a federal backstop for losses related to the writing of the terrorism peril in property and casualty insurance policies 
under the tria  the company had until february   to notify commercial policyholders about requirements of the law  let them know that the company was required to offer terrorism coverage and let them know how the coverage would be priced 
the company has distributed disclosure notices to its commercial policyholders 
the notices explained the tria and notified them of their coverage 
except for a few select cases  full policy limit coverage has been provided for terrorism for policyholders 
the terrorism rating plan  with rates that vary based on geographical and risk type factors  will go into effect in the near future 
the plan will charge all commercial policies a nominal terrorism premium to encourage them to accept coverage while minimizing the company s administrative costs 
environmental claims mnh  like many other property and casualty insurance companies  is subject to environmental damage claims asserted by or against its insureds 
management of the company is of the opinion that based on various court decisions throughout the country  certain of these claims should not be recoverable under the terms of mnh s insurance policies because of either specific or general coverage exclusions contained in the policies 
however  there is no assurance that the courts will agree with mnh s position in every case  nor can there be assurance that material claims will not be asserted under policies which a court will find do not explicitly or implicitly exclude claims for environmental damages 
management  however  is not aware of any pending claim or group of claims which would result in a liability that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company or mnh 
inflation inflation affects the company  like other companies in the property and casualty insurance industry  by contributing to higher losses  lae and operating costs  as well as greater investment income resulting from the higher interest rates which can prevail in an inflationary period 
premium rates  however  may not keep pace with inflation since competitive forces may limit the company s ability to increase premium rates 
the company considers inflationary trends in estimating its reserves for claims reported and for incurred but not reported claims 
relationship with mutual the company s and mnh s business and day to day operations are closely aligned with those of mutual 
this is the result of a combination of factors 
mutual has had a historical ownership interest in the company and mnh 
prior to november mnh was a wholly owned subsidiary of mutual 
following the company s initial public offering in november and until a secondary stock offering in july the company was a majority owned subsidiary of mutual 
at december  mutual owned of the company s common stock 
under the services agreement  mutual provides the company and mnh with all facilities and with personnel to operate their business 
with the exception of the individual who serves as president of the company and the chief operating officer of mnh  the only other officers of the company or mnh are employees of mutual whose services are provided to  and paid for by  the company and mnh through the services agreement 
also  the operation of mnh s insurance business  which offers substantially the same lines of insurance as mutual through the same independent insurance agents  creates a very close relationship among the companies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risk related to the company s financial instruments primarily relates to its investment portfolio 
the value of the company s investment portfolio of  at december  is subject to changes in interest rates and to a lesser extent on credit quality 
further  certain mortgage backed and asset backed securities are exposed to accelerated prepayment risk generally caused by interest rate movements 
as interest rates decline  mortgage holders are more likely to refinance existing mortgages at lower rates 
acceleration of future repayments could adversely affect future investment income  if reinvestment of the accelerated receipts was made in lower yielding securities 
the table below provides information related to the company s fixed maturity investments at december  the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the cash flows are based upon the maturity date or  in the case of mortgage backed and asset backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from those shown in the table

actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  the forward looking statements should not be considered projections of future events by the company
