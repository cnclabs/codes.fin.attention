item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under 
summary of business considerations and certain factors that may affect future operating results and or stock price on page overview applied signal technology  inc provides advanced digital signal processing products  systems  and services used in reconnaissance of telecommunications signals for intelligence gathering  a process referred to as signal intelligence 
our primary customer is the united states government 
signal reconnaissance systems are comprised of collection and processing equipment 
signal collection equipment consists of sophisticated receivers that scan through potentially thousands of cellular telephone  microwave  ship to shore  and military transmissions in the radio frequency rf spectrum with the goal of collecting certain specific signals 
our signal processing equipment uses advanced software and hardware to evaluate characteristics of the collected signals and selects those most likely to contain relevant information 
at inception in  we focused our efforts primarily on processing equipment 
over time  we have broadened our scope to add specialized collection equipment and complete signal processing systems 
our revenues are primarily generated from sales of our products and services to two agencies of the united states government 
our contracts can be divided into two major types firm fixed price and cost reimbursement 
firm fixed price contracts are typically characterized by negotiated prices for efforts that involve little or no development risk 
cost risks associated with building and delivering products under fixed price contracts are borne solely by the contractor 
cost reimbursement types of contracts are characterized by negotiated target costs and fees  and are generally associated with engineering development work where there is a high degree of risk and uncertainty 
although risks associated with cost reimbursement contracts are borne by the customer  we cannot exceed contract ceilings without the approval of our customer 
the following table represents the revenue concentration by contract type fy fy fy cost reimbursement contracts fixed price contracts based on our ending backlog for fiscal year  we believe that the mix of contract types in fiscal year will be similar to fiscal year cost reimbursement contracts can include fixed fees  incentive fees  or award fees 
in the case of cost plus fixed fee contracts  the fee dollars are negotiated and fixed at the inception of the contract 
cost plus incentive fee contracts include a negotiated fee that may be adjusted during the performance of the contract by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs 
cost plus award fee contracts can include fees consisting of a base amount that is fixed at the inception of the contract and an award amount that is earned in whole or in part during the performance of the contract based upon the evaluation of the customer 
in fiscal year  we experienced significant revenue growth  which we believe was a result of increased spending by the us government on signal intelligence solutions 
we believe the us government s emphasis on protecting us citizens  due to the current world state of affairs  has created a renewed emphasis upon signal intelligence gathering 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions  and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be critical accounting policies 
see 
note to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
revenue and cost recognition 
the majority of our contracts  which are with the us government  are accounted for in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of opinion  accounting for performance of construction type and production type contracts 
these contracts are transacted using written contractual arrangements  most of which require us to design  develop  manufacture and or modify our complex products  and perform related services according to specifications provided by the customer 
we account for fixed price contracts by using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  contract costs are charged to operations as incurred 
a portion of the contract revenue  based on estimated profits and the degree of completion of the contract as measured by a comparison of the actual and estimated costs  is recognized as revenue each period 
we account for cost reimbursement contracts by charging contract costs to opera tions as incurred and recognizing contract revenues and profits by applying an estimated fee rate to actual costs on an individual contract basis 
for those contracts in which all of the terms have not yet been finalized  revenue does not include an estimated fee rate on cost 
management reviews contract performance  costs incurred  and estimated completion costs regularly and adjusts revenues and profits on contracts in the period in which changes become determinable 
our engineering services contracts are typically performed on a level of effort basis 
revenue is calculated in accordance with our policy regarding cost reimbursement contracts  specifically  revenue is based on a fee percentage applied to the costs incurred on these contracts 
anticipated losses on cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts are also recorded in the period in which they become determinable 
unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in material costs  inefficiencies  or other factors are borne by us on fixed price contracts  and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition 
unexpected cost increases in cost reimbursement contracts may be borne by us for purposes of maintaining customer relationships 
historically  the effect on operating results and financial condition from cost reimbursement losses has been minimal 
award fee recognition 
our policy for recognizing interim fee on our cost plus award fee contracts is based on management s assessment as to the likelihood that the award fee or an incremental portion of the award fee will be earned on a contract by contract basis 
management s assessments are based on numerous factors including contract terms  nature of the work to be performed  our relationship and history with the customer  our history with similar types of projects  and our current and anticipated performance on the specific contract 
no award fee is recognized until management determines that it is probable that an award fee or a portion thereof will be earned 
actual fees awarded are typically within management s estimates 
however  changes could arise within an award fee period causing management to either lower or raise the award fee estimate in the period in which it occurs 
indirect rate variance 
we record contract revenues and costs for interim reporting purposes based on annual targeted indirect rates 
at year end  the revenues and costs are adjusted for actual indirect rates 
during the interim reporting periods  variances may accumulate between the actual indirect rates and the annual targeted rates 
all timing related indirect spending variances are inventoried as part of work in process during these interim reporting periods 
these rates are reviewed regularly  and we record reserves for any permanent variances in the period they become known 
we have determined that this estimate is the preferred practice used within our industry 
our accounting policy is based on management s belief that such interim variances  if deemed recoverable  will be absorbed by expected contract activities during the remainder of the year 
if contract activities do not reach planned levels  there are alternatives we may utilize to absorb the variance we can adjust some of our planned indirect spending during the year  modify our billing rates to our customers  or record adjustments to expense based on reduced estimates of future contract activities 
at the end of fiscal year  there was a charge to profit of  for a bonus payment to our employees that was not recovered in our billing rates to our customers 
at certain points during fiscal year  we determined that a portion of the indirect expenses would not be absorbed by expected contract activities 
as a result  we recorded a charge to profit of approximately   and  during the second  third  and fourth quarters  respectively 
these additional charges reflect a total of approximately  in indirect expenses that was excluded from our indirect billing rates in fiscal year in fiscal year  the charge to profit for unabsorbed indirect expenses was approximately  income taxes 
our income tax expense at interim reporting periods is based on an estimated effective tax rate 
this estimated tax rate is calculated based on the projected net income at the end of the fiscal year  and is reviewed at each reporting period 
at the end of the fiscal year  income tax expense is adjusted for actual results 
our effective tax rate can differ from the statutory rate 
historically  the variance from the statutory rate has been mainly due to expected benefits from r d credits and the reversals of valuation allowances 
operating results fiscal years comparison the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues from contracts  and  at the end of each period indicated  our backlog year ended october  revenues from contracts operating expenses contract costs research and development general and administrative restructuring costs total operating expenses operating income loss interest income expense  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss backlog thousands of dollars results in fiscal year  new orders increased approximately  which created a increase in revenues and a increase in ending backlog  when compared to fiscal year in addition  our operating expenses grew at a lower rate than revenues 
the growth in revenue  in conjunction with controlled spending  led to a increase in net income during fiscal year over fiscal year we believe the increase in revenues is the result of the us government s renewed interest in spending on signal intelligence solutions 
in fiscal year  we experienced a increase in orders compared to fiscal year this led to an increase in year over year revenues of and a increase in our ending backlog 
as a result of the growth in revenues in fiscal year  a lower operating cost structure when compared to fiscal year  and the absence of our reintegrated subsidiaries  we returned to profitability in fiscal year we experienced a significant revenue decline in fiscal year this decline was due  in part  to what we believed to be delays in the awarding of certain significant engineering development contracts and  in part  to the unanticipated contract closeout of three significant engineering development contracts for the convenience of the customer 
in order to better align infrastructure costs with anticipated revenues  we reduced our consolidated workforce by employees  or approximately of the workforce  during as a result of staff reductions  research and development spending  overhead spending  and marketing expenditures were reduced 
we amended our facilities lease and terminated the lease of two buildings and the option for a third building 
the total reduction in facilities was approximately  square feet 
in addition  during fiscal year  we reintegrated our two subsidiaries  enetsecure  inc  and transcendent technologies  inc  due to their inability to obtain adequate third party financing 
from their inception through the completion of the reintegration of enetsecure and transcendent  we invested approximately  and  respectively  plus the necessary equipment and intellectual property 
upon reintegration  we hired and employees from enetsecure and transcendent  respectively 
revenues revenues were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
revenues increased by during fiscal year over fiscal year and by during fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in engineering development efforts designed to provide a variety of signal intelligence solutions to the us government was the primary reason for the significant increase in revenues during fiscal year in fiscal year  we experienced an increase in our standard product sales over fiscal year the following table identifies the source of our revenues for fiscal years   and by major market fy fy fy intelligence agencies military law enforcement foreign commercial within the major markets  two intelligence agencies and one branch of the military represented a significant portion of revenues 
the table below identifies the revenue concentration from each significant customer 
fy fy fy first intelligence agency second intelligence agency one branch of the military revenues from the us government can also be categorized as direct purchases and subcontracts  where we are the supplier to another contractor 
the following table distinguishes revenue between those two categories 
fy fy fy direct purchases subcontracts in addition  our largest contract and its follow on effort accounted for approximately   and of revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively 
backlog our backlog consists of anticipated revenues from new contracts and from the yet to be completed portions of existing contracts excluding unexercised options 
at the end of fiscal year  ending backlog was approximately  representing a increase from fiscal year ending backlog of approximately  the dramatic increase to the ending backlog balance of fiscal year was due to new orders of approximately  during the fourth quarter 
during fiscal year  backlog increased by from fiscal year ending backlog of  the increase in backlog during fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in new orders generated during the year  when compared to fiscal year contract costs contract costs consist of direct costs incurred on contracts such as labor  materials  and manufacturing overhead costs 
contract costs were approximately  or of revenues in fiscal year  compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year the increase in contract costs during fiscal year compared to fiscal year is a result of an increase in our cost reimbursement contracts  since these contracts are typically negotiated for a smaller profit 
contract costs decreased during fiscal year from fiscal year due to the lower cost structure that resulted from the fiscal year restructuring activities 
research and development expenses company directed investment in research and development consists of expenditures recoverable from customers through billing rates and expenditures funded by us from operations 
research and development expenses were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year the decrease in research and development costs in fiscal year is due to management s decision to allocate labor resources to meet our contractual commitments and reduce overall r d spending during fiscal year the decrease in spending during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of management s decision to return research and development expenses to historical levels 
in addition  fiscal year costs included approximately  by our reintegrated sub sidiary corporations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries  costs related to marketing and proposal activities  costs related to product warranties  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year in fiscal year  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue as a result of management s decision to hold our cost structure in place 
we determined that our current cost structure could support our current revenue levels 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year when compared to spending levels in fiscal year due to a lower operating cost structure 
restructuring costs there were no restructuring costs in fiscal years and during fiscal year  we implemented cost reduction actions resulting in restructuring costs of  cost reduction actions included a workforce reduction of employees  which included technical employees and administrative employees 
this represented a reduction in the number of employees during fiscal year the restructuring costs included severance related benefits of approximately  the write off of leasehold improvements associated with vacated facilities of approximately  and other associated restructuring costs of  restructuring costs were partially offset by the reversal of deferred rent associated with terminated facility leases of approximately  the deferred rent balance had been recorded over several years beginning with the inception of the lease term and represented the difference between amounts paid for re nt expense and the amounts recognized in the statement of operations on a straight line basis 
interest income expense  net net interest income for fiscal year was approximately  compared to approximately  and  of net interest income in fiscal years and  respectively 
cash and investment balances at the beginning of fiscal year were greater than at the beginning of fiscal year  and therefore generated more interest income in fiscal year in addition  interest activities in fiscal year included interest payments of approximately  related to federal and state tax liabilities  which caused a decrease in net interest income from fiscal year income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal year is  compared to a benefit rate of for fiscal year and a benefit rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate at the end of fiscal year differs from the federal statutory rate and our estimated effective tax rate at the end of the third quarter  primarily due to the reduction of a valuation allowance that was originally recorded in fiscal year the valuation allowance was reduced in the fourth quarter due to the availability of potential carryback refunds for taxes paid in fiscal year the benefit of approximately  was comprised of a federal benefit of  partially offset by a miscellaneous state income tax expense of  the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state tax credits  the usage of valuation allowance  and a benefit as result of a tax law change during fiscal year  which allowed us to recover additional taxes paid in prior years 
in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  as the result of operating losses that were carried back to recover taxes paid in prior years 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity during fiscal year were the cash flows generated from operations and the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plans 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  a misclassification was discovered in the previously reported october  balance sheet and cash flow statement 
at october   approximately  of asset backed securities was misclassified on the balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents instead of as short term investments 
the misclassification has no impact on our statement of operations for any period  including revenues and net income 
the october  consolidated balance sheet and fiscal year consolidated statement of cash flows in this report have been changed to reflect the correct classification 
cash from operating activities 
net cash from operating activities has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
net cash provided was approximately  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year for fiscal year  operating activities used cash of approximately  the year to year variances are primarily the result of changes in net income loss  accounts receivable  refundable income taxes  inventories held by us  and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net income for fiscal years and was approximately  and  respectively  which contrasts to a net loss in fiscal year of approximately  net income increased in fiscal year due  in part  to a significant growth in revenues  and in part  to our operating expenses experiencing proportionately less growth than revenue 
the fiscal year net income was primarily due to our lower operating cost structure  which was the result of the fiscal year restructuring activities 
the fiscal year net loss was due to a reduction in revenues  absorption of indirect contract costs incurred to lower our billing rates  an investment of approximately  in research and development  which was not reimbursed through the billing rates  the occurrence of subsidiary losses of approximately  and restructuring costs of approximately  accounts receivable balances increased by approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
in contrast  accounts receivable balances decreased by approximately  in fiscal year our billed and unbilled receivables balances increased during fiscal year  which was a result of our increase in revenues 
the fluctuation of accounts receivable in fiscal year was driven primarily by two factors 
first  our forward loss balance reduced by approximately  which was an element of unbilled receivables 
second  increased efficiency in our collection process led to an overall decrease of our billed receivables 
the net effect created an increase in total accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal year is due  primarily  to a decline in sales of our products and services and  in part  to a  charge for doubtful accounts 
in fiscal year  we collected the remaining  of a problematic accounts receivable item disclosed in fiscal year this resolved a potential reduction in operating income of up to  all amounts due under this receivable have now been collected in their entirety 
cash provided by refundable income taxes for fiscal years and was zero and approximately  respectively 
we received a federal tax refund in fiscal year  which was recorded in fiscal year cash used for inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets was approximately  in fiscal year in contrast  these activities provided cash of approximately  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
fiscal year activities included an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  which was primarily driven by an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in inventories of approximately  this decrease to inventory included approximately  in obsolete products that were scrapped 
the obsolete inventory included raw materials as well as units in different stages of development 
in fiscal year  inventories decreased approximately  which was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets in fiscal year included an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately  and prepaid income taxes of  accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances increased in fiscal years and by approximately  and  respectively 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal year decreased by approximately  the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during fiscal year is primarily the result of our increased contract activities during fiscal year the improvement in cash flows in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily attributed to the changes in our cost structure during the second half of fiscal year related to the reduction in staff 
in fiscal year  accounts payable balances increased by approximately  due to our increased activity in contract costs 
accrued payroll and related liabilities increased approximately  due to an increase in the number of employees 
in addition  accrued payroll liabilities included a bonus accrual of approximately  which was paid in december in fiscal year  accrued payroll related liabilities increased approximately  mostly due to an increased participation in the stock purchase plan by our employees 
trade accounts payable in fiscal year increased by approximately  as a result of improved contract activities 
other immaterial liabilities increased by approximately in fiscal year  accrued payroll liabilities decreased by approximately  primarily due to payment of various liabilities associated with staff reductions 
trade accounts payable balances decreased in fiscal year by approximately  due to a significant decline in contract activity 
income taxes payable decreased by approximately  due to the net loss incurred in fiscal year other liabilities decreased by approximately  cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal years and was approximately  and  respectively 
in fiscal year  investing activities provided cash of approximately  in fiscal year  we purchased approximately  in available for sale securities  while approximately  matured 
in addition  fiscal year property and equipment purchases were approximately  fiscal year investing activities included purchases of available for sale securities of approximately  and property and equipment of approximately  in contrast  in fiscal year  maturities of available for sale securities provided cash of approximately  partially offset by additions to property and equipment of approximately  cash from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the sources of cash from financing activities during each of these three years were the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
the increase in cash provided during fiscal year was due to an increase in stock option exercises 
the fluctuation in cash provided by financing activities between fiscal year and fiscal year is due to the absence of dividend payments in fiscal year cash is generated primarily from operating activities  employee stock activities  and investing activities 
we believe the primary risk to liquidity is the potential decrease in demand for our products and services 
historically  this demand has been influenced by the needs of the united states intelligence community 
we believe that the funds generated from operations  existing working capital  and the amount available under our existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months 
we have a cash secured line of credit with a bank in the amount  which will expire on march  any borrowings bear interest at the bank s reference rate and accrued interest on these borrowings is payable monthly 
there are no fees associated with the unused portion of the committed amount 
under this line of credit agreement  we have one standby letter of credit outstanding in the amount of approximately  related to our facilities lease  and as of october  there were no other borrowings 
commitments and contingencies we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements  which expire at various dates between fiscal years and certain leases contain escalation clauses and requirements for the payment of property taxes  insurance  and maintenance expenses 
the aggregate minimum annual lease commitments as of october  under long term operating leases are as follows in thousands fiscal year thereafter we had outstanding letters of credit at october    and totaling approximately   and  respectively 
in fiscal year  a purchase agreement for computer equipment created a liability of approximately  as of october  there is approximately  outstanding  which will be paid in march product warranties 
our products  including associated firmware and software  are warranted against defective workmanship and materials for a period of one year from the date of acceptance by the original purchaser 
in addition  we offer extended warranties at a percentage of the purchase price 
an additional six month warranty may be purchased for of the unit or system purchase price 
additional one year warranty coverage is of the unit or system purchase price 
warranty costs were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with an exit activity  including restructuring  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
exit activities include  but are not limited to  eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas specifies that a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
therefore  commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only management s intended future actions and does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas s amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for our fiscal year sfas s amendment of the disclosure requirements of opinion was adopted during our second quarter of fiscal year in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
this pronouncement requires the consolidation of variable interest entities created after january  consolidation provisions apply for periods ending after march  for variable interest entities  other than special purpose entities  created prior to february  we do not have any variable interest entities  including special purpose entities  that must be consolidated and therefore the adoption of the provision of fin will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  we currently do not have any derivative instruments under sfas in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify certain financial instruments as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
the average days to maturity of our investment portfolio is days 
due to the short term nature of these cash investments  we do not believe that there is a material interest rate risk 
as of october   our total cash and investments balance that was sensitive to interest rate risk was approximately  the sensitivity of our portfolio is if yields were to fluctuate by basis points  the total effect to the investment portfolio balance would be approximately  the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents  and short term securities  at fair value  that are sensitive to interest rate risk in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term  available for sale securities asset backed securities corporate securities government securities money market securities
