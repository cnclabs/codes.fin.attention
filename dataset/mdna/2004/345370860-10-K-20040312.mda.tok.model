item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item business continued substantially all of the hourly employees in our automotive operations in the united states are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements 
approximately of these unionized hourly employees in our automotive segment are represented by the uaw 
approximately of our salaried employees are represented by unions 
most hourly employees and many non management salaried employees of our subsidiaries outside the united states also are represented by unions 
we have entered into collective bargaining agreements with the uaw and the national automobile  aerospace  transportation and general workers union of canada caw 
the agreement with the uaw is scheduled to expire on september  and the agreement with the caw is scheduled to expire on september  among other things  our agreements with the uaw and caw provide for guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout their terms and provide for significant employment security 
as a practical matter  these agreements may restrict our ability to eliminate product lines  close plants  and divest businesses 
our new collective bargaining agreements are consistent with our revitalization plan and provide us the flexibility necessary to achieve the goals of that plan 
this flexibility includes the ability to reduce manufacturing capacity by one million units in north america by closing four assembly plants  improvement in our ability to bring ford employees assigned to visteon back to fill plant openings for which we otherwise would have to hire new employees and increased operating flexibility 
the return of ford employees will provide us the opportunity to fill labor requirements from an experienced pool of uaw represented employees 
in  we negotiated new agreements with labor unions in mexico  france  britain  sweden  australia  taiwan  thailand  new zealand  belgium  and brazil 
we are or will be negotiating new collective bargaining agreements with labor unions in mexico  germany  vietnam  south africa  taiwan  britain  brazil and venezuela where current agreements will expire in we will also be negotiating new collective bargaining agreements to cover employees at our volvo and jaguar affiliates in in recent years  we have not had significant work stoppages at our facilities  but they have occurred in some of our suppliers facilities 
a work stoppage could occur as a result of disputes under our collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements  which  if protracted  could adversely affect our business and results of operation 
work stoppages at supplier facilities for labor or other reasons could have similar consequences if alternate sources of components are not readily available 
in addition to our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw  in we entered into a separate agreement with the uaw in connection with the sale of our dearborn steel making operations to rouge industries  inc  then known as marico acquisition corp 
as part of the sale  employees of our former steel making operations became employees of rouge steel company  a wholly owned subsidiary of rouge industries  inc rouge 
pursuant to the uaw agreement  we agreed that rouge hourly employees who  at the time of the sale  were represented by the uaw and met certain seniority requirements would be allowed to return to ford to work in one of our rouge area plants if they were laid off by rouge in the future as a result of a layoff of unknown duration  a permanent discontinuance of operations by rouge or a sale of the assets of rouge 
the right to return remains in effect with respect to each eligible employee for a period equal to the employee s ford seniority as of the date of the sale by ford 
approximately former ford employees are covered by this agreement 
on october   rouge filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on december   the bankruptcy court approved the sale of substantially all of rouge s assets to severstal north america  inc severstal  which sale closed on january  on february   ford entered into an agreement with the uaw to provide opportunities to the employees of rouge who would have had the right to return to

item legal proceedings overview various legal actions  governmental investigations and proceedings and claims are pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us and our subsidiaries  including  but not limited to  those arising out of the following alleged defects in our products  governmental regulations covering safety  emissions  and fuel economy  financial services  employment related matters  dealer  supplier  and other contractual relationships  intellectual property rights  product warranties  environmental matters  and shareholder matters 
some of the pending legal actions are  or purport to be  class actions 
some of the foregoing matters involve or may involve compensatory  punitive or antitrust or other multiplied damage claims in very large amounts  or demands for recall campaigns  environmental remediation programs  sanctions or other relief that  if granted  would require very large expenditures 
we regularly evaluate the expected outcome of product liability litigation and other litigation matters 
we have accrued expenses for probable losses on product liability matters  in the aggregate  based on an analysis of historical litigation payouts and trends 
expenses also have been accrued for other litigation where losses are deemed probable 
these accruals are reflected in our financial statements 

table of contents item legal proceedings continued following is a discussion of our significant pending legal proceedings product liability matters asbestos matters 
asbestos was used in brakes  clutches and other automotive components dating from the early s 
along with other vehicle manufacturers  we have been the target of asbestos litigation and  as a result  we are a defendant in various actions for injuries claimed to have resulted from alleged contact with certain ford parts and other products containing asbestos 
plaintiffs in these personal injury cases allege various health problems as a result of asbestos exposure either from i component parts found in older vehicles ii insulation or other asbestos products in our facilities or iii asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet 
the majority of these cases have been filed in the state courts 
most of the asbestos litigation we face involves mechanics or other individuals who have worked on the brakes of our vehicles over the years 
also  in most asbestos litigation we are not the sole defendant 
we believe we are being more aggressively targeted in asbestos suits because many previously targeted companies have filed for bankruptcy 
we are prepared to defend these asbestos related cases and  with respect to the cases alleging exposure from our brakes  believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long standing position that mechanics and others are not at an increased risk of asbestos related disease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brakes on our vehicles 
the extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate 
the majority of our asbestos cases do not specify a dollar amount for damages  and in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum 
the vast majority of these cases involve multiple defendants  with the number in some cases exceeding our annual payout and related defense costs in asbestos cases are increasing and may become substantial in the future 
the total number of claims pending against us as of february  is approximately  compared with approximately  as of february this  together with the trends in civil litigation toward larger jury verdicts and punitive damages awards  is expected to result in increased payouts and defense costs in the united states congress continues to consider proposals to reform asbestos litigation 
the lead proposal would create a trust fund from which eligible asbestos claimants would be compensated and would preclude  during the life of the trust  litigation in the united states based on exposure to asbestos 
the trust fund would be funded by asbestos defendants including us and the insurance industry 
these funds would be used to pay eligible claimants ie  those who satisfy specific medical criteria and can adequately demonstrate occupational exposure to asbestos according to a specified schedule 
if legislation is enacted creating such a trust fund  we would likely be required to make substantial contributions to the fund over a specified period of time  resulting in our incurring a charge in the amount of the present value of such anticipated contributions in the period in which the legislation becomes effective 
we cannot predict whether or in what form the legislation will be enacted or the costs associated with such enactment 
romo v 
ford 
during december   an action was filed in superior court in stanislaus county  california  alleging that manufacturing and design defects in a bronco caused the deaths of three members of the plaintiff s family 
the trial in july resulted in a jury verdict ordering us to pay million in punitive damages and million in compensatory damages 
on may   the united states supreme court granted our petition for certiorari and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the supreme court s decision in state farm v 
campbell  which held that punitive awards generally cannot exceed nine times the compensatory award and that punitive awards cannot be based on out of state or dissimilar conduct 
on remand  the california appeals court gave the plaintiffs the choice of either accepting a reduced punitive damages award in 
table of contents item legal proceedings continued the amount of approximately million slightly less than five times the million compensatory damage award or a new trial 
the plaintiffs elected to accept the reduced punitive damages award  which  with interest  amounted to approximately million 
environmental matters general 
we have received notices under various federal and state environmental laws that we along with others may be a potentially responsible party for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage  recycling or disposal sites in many states and  in some instances  for natural resource damages 
we also may have been a generator of hazardous substances at a number of other sites 
the amount of any such costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could be substantial 
the contingent losses that we expect to incur in connection with many of these sites have been accrued and those losses are reflected in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  for many sites  the remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible are not reasonably estimable because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site or to materials there  the involvement of other potentially responsible parties  the application of laws and other standards or regulations  site conditions  and the nature and scope of investigations  studies  and remediation to be undertaken including the technologies to be required and the extent  duration  and success of remediation 
as a result  we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the amount of costs or other damages for which we are potentially responsible in connection with these sites  although that total could be substantial 
cleveland engine plant notice of violation 
following an inspection by the cleveland local air agency which has been delegated enforcement authority by the ohio environmental protection agency ohio epa our cleveland engine plant received a notice of violation in july the nov alleged violations of permit limitations for a maintenance paint spray booth and engine testing operations 
the potential violations associated with the engine testing operations previously had been reported to ohio epa 
in december  ford resolved the matter with ohio epa through an administrative settlement that included a nominal penalty 
cleveland casting plant notice of violation 
following an inspection by the cleveland local air agency  our cleveland casting plant received a notice of violation in july the nov alleged that the plant exceeded a number of its permit limitations  modified its emission sources without first obtaining a permit to install  did not operate certain process equipment according to permit requirements  and did not conduct required emission testing 
in december  ford resolved the matter with ohio epa through an administrative settlement that included a nominal penalty 
wixom assembly plant notice of violation regarding air emissions 
in september  the department of environmental quality the deq notified ford that it is commencing an enforcement action related to several abatement equipment malfunctions at our wixom  michigan assembly plant over the last few years 
the deq alleges that the plant did not properly follow state air rules governing abatement equipment malfunction 
we are negotiating the terms of a malfunction abatement plan with the deq that will be included in the plant s operating permit 
it is reasonably possible that the deq could seek monetary sanctions of  or more for these alleged violations 
class actions the following are actions filed against us on behalf of individual plaintiffs and all others similarly situated ie  purported class actions 
in light of the fact that very few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past have ever been certified by the courts as class actions  the actions listed below are limited to those that i have been certified as a class action by a court of competent 
table of contents item legal proceedings continued jurisdiction and any additional purported class actions that raise allegations substantially similar to a certified case and ii if resolved unfavorably to the company  would likely involve a significant cost 
firestone class actions 
over firestone related class actions have been filed against us  but many have been consolidated into a single case now pending in federal court in indianapolis 
plaintiffs in these cases have never been injured in an accident involving firestone tires  but they seek to recover  on behalf of all purchasers of ford explorers with firestone tires  the alleged diminution in vehicle value caused by the use of those tires or by the alleged instability of explorers 
plaintiffs also seek punitive damages 
in the case pending in indianapolis  the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit has ruled that the case cannot be maintained as a nationwide or statewide class action 
plaintiffs are now focusing on some of the cases that have not yet been transferred to indianapolis 
these cases were filed in state courts in illinois  pennsylvania  south carolina cases  wisconsin  arkansas cases  california cases  louisiana  ohio  texas cases  connecticut cases  florida  and tennessee 
some of these cases have been removed to federal court and are likely to be transferred to the court in indianapolis  where they will be subject to the seventh circuit s order denying class certification 
some of these cases  however  will remain in state court where the trial courts will be free to reconsider the issue of class certification 
a state trial judge in arkansas has dismissed one of the cases pending in that state because plaintiffs suffered no injury 
in the case filed in illinois  and in one of the cases filed in south carolina  the trial courts have already certified statewide classes 
in those cases  however  plaintiffs are not relying on any alleged defects in the ford explorer  rather  they allege only that firestone atx and wilderness at tires installed on ford explorers and mercury mountaineers are defective 
since we have already agreed to replace all of these tires  we are seeking to have these cases dismissed as moot 
we will also be seeking appellate review of these rulings 
on june   the us court of appeals enjoined the prosecutions of state cases that purport to represent a nationwide class on the basis that the court s prior decisions establish conclusively that these cases cannot be tried as nationwide class actions 
state cases that involve only statewide classes are unaffected by the june decision  but are likely to be stayed pending completion of a settlement that firestone has tentatively negotiated with the plaintiffs 
the proposed settlement would require plaintiffs to dismiss all class action claims against ford that are based on alleged tire defects 
paint class actions 
a purported class action in state court in illinois asserts claims on behalf of residents of all states except texas who have experienced paint peeling on most through model year ford vehicles 
plaintiffs allege fraud  breach of warranty  and violations of consumer protection statutes  contending that their paint is defective and susceptible to peeling because we did not use spray primer between the high build electrocoat hbec and the color coat 
the lack of spray primer allegedly causes the adhesion of the color coat to the hbec to deteriorate after extended exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight 
plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages in an amount to cover the cost of repainting their vehicles and to compensate for alleged diminution in value  punitive damages  attorneys fees and interest 
on september   the court certified the class of owners of model year vehicles that have experienced paint peeling all states except texas 
we will seek leave to appeal this order 
a second purported class action  filed in texas state court  involving essentially the same allegations was settled for a nominal amount following reversal by the texas court of appeals of the trial court s order certifying a class 
ford citibank visa class action 
four purported nationwide class actions and two purported statewide class actions are pending against us in connection with the june announcement of the termination of the ford citibank credit card rebate program  citibank is also a defendant in some 
table of contents item legal proceedings continued of these actions 
the actions allege damages in an amount up to  for each cardholder who obtained a ford citibank credit card in reliance on the rebate program and who is precluded from accumulating discounts toward the purchase or lease of new ford vehicles after december as a result of the termination of the rebate program 
plaintiffs contend that defendants deceptively breached their contract by unilaterally terminating the program  that defendants have been unjustly enriched as a result of the interest charges and fees collected from cardholders  and further  that defendants conspired to deprive plaintiffs of the benefits of their credit card agreement 
plaintiffs seek compensatory damages  or alternatively  reinstatement of the rebate program  and punitive damages  costs  expenses and attorneys fees 
the four purported nationwide class actions are pending in state courts in alabama  illinois  new york  and washington  and the purported statewide class actions are pending in california state courts 
the alabama court has conditionally certified a class consisting of alabama residents 
crown victoria police interceptor class actions 
a total of purported class actions have been filed on behalf of government entities that own ford crown victoria police interceptors  alleging that the vehicles are susceptible to fuel leaks and fires when struck from the rear at high speed 
twenty of the actions have been consolidated into a multi district litigation mdl proceeding in the us district court  northern district of ohio 
the remaining actions are pending in illinois cases and california 
five of the cases purport to represent a nationwide class  the other cases purport to represent statewide classes 
the complaints seek a recall of the affected vehicles  an injunction  compensatory and punitive damages and other relief 
a state court in illinois has certified a state wide class of all municipalities in the state of illinois that own police interceptor vehicles 
six additional purported class actions relating to non police ford crown victoria vehicles  with similar allegations and demands for relief  have been filed in arkansas  illinois  ohio  california  florida  and texas 
the arkansas and ohio cases purport to represent a nationwide class  the others purport to represent owners in the relevant state 
f radiator class actions 
three purported class actions are pending alleging that the company defrauded purchasers of approximately  f trucks by falsely representing that certain option packages included upgraded radiators 
in one case  in state court in texas  the trial court has certified a nationwide class of all purchasers of and f trucks with heavy duty or trailer packages 
we are appealing that ruling to the texas court of appeals 
cases in south carolina and california purport to represent statewide classes 
prior to the filing of these suits  we implemented a program that gives affected customers a choice of cash  a coupon  or installation of an upgraded radiator 
however  plaintiffs are alleging that the program should cover additional vehicles  that they should be reimbursed for loss of use of the vehicle while the radiators are being replaced  and that they are entitled to attorney fees 
hydroboost truck brake class action 
a purported class action was filed on august  in state court in oklahoma on behalf of all purchasers of through model year f  f  f  and f ford super duty trucks and excursions with hydroboost hydraulic braking systems 
the complaint alleges that these trucks are unsafe because they suffer diminished power assist to the steering when the driver is simultaneously braking and steering 
the complaint alleges breach of warranty and fraud  and seeks the cost of retrofitting the trucks to eliminate the alleged danger  compensation for diminished resale value  and other relief 
on january   the court granted plaintiff s motion to certify a nationwide class  and agreed to stay proceedings while we appeal 
the safety administration investigated a similar issue and closed the investigation  finding that diminished steering assist while braking is present in these trucks  but that the associated injury and property damage incidents are so rare that they do not present a risk to vehicle safety

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview generation of revenue  income and cash our automotive sector s revenue  income and cash are generated primarily from sales of vehicles to our dealers and distributors ie  our customers 
vehicles we produce generally are subject to firm orders from our customers and generally are deemed sold with the proceeds from such sale recognized in revenue immediately after they are produced and shipped to our customers 
this is not the case  however  with respect to vehicles produced for sale to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option or vehicles produced for use in our own fleet including management evaluation vehicles 
vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option are accounted for as operating leases  with lease revenue and profits recognized over the term of the lease 
when we sell the vehicle at auction  we recognize a gain or loss on the difference  if any  between actual auction value and the projected auction value 
therefore  except for the impact of the daily rental units sold subject to a guaranteed repurchase option and those units placed into our own fleet  vehicle production is closely linked with unit sales and revenue from such sales 
our financial services sector s revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables  including interest  net of certain deferred loan origination costs that are included as a reduction of financing revenue  and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method 
also  revenue from operating leases  net of certain deferred origination costs  is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
income is generated to the extent revenues exceed expenses  most of which are interest and operating expenses 
transactions between the automotive and financial services sectors occur in the ordinary course of business 
for example  ford credit receives interest supplements and other support cost payments from the automotive sector in connection with special vehicle financing and leasing programs that it sponsors 
ford credit records these payments as revenue over the term of the related finance receivable or operating lease 
the automotive sector records the estimated costs of marketing incentives  including dealer and retail customer cash payments eg  rebates and costs of special financing and leasing programs  as a reduction to revenue at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated 
key economic factors and trends affecting automotive industry excess capacity 
according to csm worldwide  an automotive research firm  in  the automotive industry s estimated global production capacity for light vehicles about million units significantly exceeded global production of cars and trucks about million units 
in north america and europe  the two regions where the majority of revenue and profits are earned in the industry  excess capacity was an estimated and  respectively  in we expect that this condition will continue for many years 
pricing pressure 
excess capacity coupled with a proliferation of new products being introduced in key segments by the industry will keep pressure on manufacturers ability to increase prices on their products 
in addition  in recent years  korean based manufacturers have been increasing the number of vehicles they export for sale in the united states and other key markets  and this has contributed  and is expected to continue to contribute  to pricing pressure 
in the united states  the reduction of real prices for similarly contented vehicles accelerated in recent years  and we expect that a challenging pricing environment will continue for some time to come 
in europe  the automotive industry has experienced intense pricing pressure for several years  in  net pricing declined more in europe than in the united states 
net pricing is a measure of the combined effect 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of changes in wholesale prices for vehicles sold and marketing incentives incurred on those vehicles  while excluding the effects of changes in unit sales volume and foreign currency exchange rates 
consumer spending trends 
we expect  however  that a decline in  or the inability to increase  vehicle prices could be offset by the spending habits of consumers and their propensity to purchase over time higher end  more expensive vehicles and or vehicles with more features 
over the next decade  in the united states  we expect that growth in spending on vehicle mix and content will generally track the increase in real gdp per capita 
the benefits of this to revenue growth in the automotive industry are significant 
in the united states  for example  consumers in the highest income bracket are buying more often and more frequently buying upscale 
we believe the share of the premium brand segment in the us automotive industry will approach by the end of this decade  compared with about to presently 
with our luxury brands ie  lincoln  volvo  jaguar  land rover and aston martin  we believe we are positioned well to take advantage of this trend 
although growth in vehicle unit sales ie  volume will be greatest in emerging markets in the next decade  we expect that the mature automotive markets eg  north america  western europe and japan will continue to be the source of a substantial majority of global industry revenues over the next decade 
we also expect that the north american market will continue as the single largest source of revenue for the automotive industry in the world in the next decade 
health care expenses 
in the united states  the average annual percentage increase in health care prices we have experienced in the last few years has been in the double digits 
in  our health care expenses for united states employees and retirees were billion  with about billion attributable to retirees and the balance attributable to active employees 
prescription drug costs is the fastest growing segment of our health care expenses and accounted for about one third of our total united states health care expenses in although we have taken measures to have employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits  we expect our health care costs to continue to increase 
for  our trend assumptions for us health care expenses include an initial trend rate of and a steady state trend rate of reached in these assumptions include the effect of actions we are taking and expect to take to offset health care inflation  including further employee cost sharing  administrative improvements and other efficiencies 
trends and strategies revenue management 
to address the pricing pressure that exists in the automotive industry  we have employed a customer focused revenue management strategy to maximize per unit revenue 
this strategy is focused on a disciplined approach to utilizing customer demand data available from many sources  including internet hits  transaction data  customer leads  and research to help us develop and sell vehicles that more closely match customer desires 
we believe our revenue management strategy has contributed significantly to increases in our revenue per vehicle sold for our ford north america business unit of and for and  respectively 
these amounts exclude the incremental effect on revenue from the consolidation of certain dealerships in related to fin  discussed in note of the notes to financial statements 
cost reduction 
given the difficult economic and operating environment described herein  we continue to focus on reducing our cost structure 
during  we reduced our costs by over billion at constant volume  mix and exchange and excluding special items 
cost reductions were realized in quality related costs resulting from fewer warranty claims  recalls and customer service actions  as well as reduced manufacturing  engineering and overhead costs 
lower product costs which are comprised of material and component costs for our vehicles on carryover vehicles 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued partially offset higher product costs for newly introduced vehicles 
further cost efficiencies will be realized as we continue to implement our revitalization plan 
shared technologies 
one of the strategies we are employing to realize efficiencies in manufacturing  engineering and product costs for new vehicles is the sharing of vehicle platforms and components among various models and the re use of those platforms and components from one generation of a vehicle model to the next 
revitalization plan progress in january  we announced that through the implementation of our revitalization plan  we expected to improve our pre tax profit excluding special items to billion by mid decade  which we have defined as we do not expect a linear progression to the target of billion of pre tax profit excluding special items 
in  we expect that the rate of profit improvement will be less than what we have experienced over the past couple of years 
we are still about a year away from introducing new products that are designed in a manner such that the cost to produce them is appropriate in the current pricing environment  and we are about two years away from having those products in significant volume 
in addition  as indicated above  rising health care costs remain a concern for us 
we expect  however  to make progress in  as we will focus on significantly improving the performance of our ford europe business unit  and filling our global product pipeline with new product introductions  particularly in the passenger car area 
further  as indicated above  we are continuing our efforts to improve quality and our cost structure 
overall  while conditions may slow our rate of improvement in  we believe we are on track to achieve our goal of billion in pre tax profits  excluding special items  by year end full year results of operations the results of our continuing operations below exclude the results of discontinued and held for sale operations  which are described in note of the notes to financial statements

higher excess spread and other income resulted from higher levels of outstanding securitized receivables in lower gains in resulted from lower amounts of finance receivables sold  down about billion compared with  reflecting lower funding requirements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued excluding the effects of the whole loan sale transactions  which totaled billion in the period  off balance sheet securitization income was unchanged compared with sales of finance receivables through off balance sheet securitizations have the impact on earnings of recalendarizing and reclassifying net financing margin ie  financing revenue less interest expense and credit losses related to the sold receivables  compared with how they would have been reported if ford credit continued to report the sold receivables on balance sheet and funded them through asset backed financings 
recalendarization effects occur initially when the gain or loss on sales of receivables is recognized in the period the receivables are sold 
over the life of the securitization transaction  ford credit recognizes excess spread  interest income from retained securities  servicing fees and other receivable sale income 
in addition  credit losses related to the off balance sheet securitized receivables are included in the initial and ongoing valuation of ford credit s interest only strip asset see off balance sheet arrangements sales of receivables by ford credit for definition and do not impact the provision for credit and insurance losses on the income statement and they do not influence the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses for ford credit s on balance sheet receivables 
therefore  over the life of each off balance sheet securitization transaction  the gain or loss on sale of receivables  excess spread  interest income from retained securities  servicing fees and other receivable sale income is equal to the net financing margin and credit losses that would have been reported had ford credit reported the receivables on its balance sheet and funded them through asset backed financings 
the net impact of off balance sheet securitizations on ford credit s earnings in a given period will vary depending on the amount and type of receivables sold and the timing of the transactions in the current period and the preceding two to three year period  as well as the interest rate environment at the time the finance receivables were originated and securitized 
the following table shows  on an analytical basis  the earnings impact of receivables sold in off balance sheet securitizations had ford credit reported them as on balance sheet and funded them through asset backed financing for the periods indicated in millions financing revenue retail revenue wholesale revenue total financing revenue borrowing cost net financing margin credit losses income before income taxes memo income related to off balance sheet securitizations recalendarization impact of off balance sheet securitizations in  the impact on earnings of reporting the sold receivables as off balance sheet securitizations was million higher than had these transactions been structured as on balance sheet securitizations 
this difference results from recalendarization effects caused by gain on sale accounting requirements  as discussed above 
this effect will fluctuate as the amount of receivables sold in ford credit s off balance sheet securitizations increases or decreases over time 
in a steady state of securitization activity  the difference between reporting securtitizations on or off balance sheet in a particular year approaches 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued zero

financial services sector ford credit debt and cash 
ford credit s total debt was billion at december   up billion compared with a year ago  reflecting primarily asset backed commercial paper that was previously off balance sheet debt of fcar 
ford credit s outstanding unsecured commercial paper at december  totaled billion  down billion compared with a year ago and down billion compared with year end the reduction since primarily reflects the lowering of ford credit s short term credit ratings over that time period as discussed below under debt ratings 
the lower short term credit rating has made ford credit s commercial paper largely ineligible for investment by money market mutual funds under rule a of the investment company act of  as amended 
to partially offset this reduction in ford credit s outstanding unsecured commercial paper  asset backed commercial paper issued through ford credit s fcar and motown notes sm programs increased substantially beginning in at december   ford credit had cash and cash equivalents of billion 
in the normal course of its funding activities  ford credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs 
these excess amounts are maintained primarily as highly liquid investments  provide liquidity for ford credit s short term funding obligations and give it flexibility in the use of its other funding programs 
funding 
ford credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business 
ford credit s funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to i purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of ford products  which are influenced by ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through ford credit  ii provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for ford dealers  and iii repay its debt obligations 
ford credit s funding sources include debt issuances  sales of receivables in securitizations  and bank borrowings 
debt issuance consists of short and long term unsecured debt  placed directly by ford credit or through securities dealers or underwriters in the united states and international capital markets  and reaches both retail and institutional investors 
ford credit issues commercial 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued paper in the united states  europe  canada and other international markets 
in addition to its commercial paper programs  ford credit also obtains short term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes  which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holder thereof without restriction 
at december   the principal amount outstanding of such notes was billion 
ford credit does not hold reserves specifically to fund the payment of the demand notes or any other short term funding obligation 
ford credit s policy is to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  unused committed bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuer capacity  securitizable assets  and back up credit facilities to provide liquidity for all of its short term funding obligations 
during  ford credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling receivables in securitizations because of the stability of the market for asset backed securities  their lower relative costs given our credit ratings as described below  and the diversity of funding sources that they provide 
securitized funding both on and off balance sheet  net of retained interests as a percent of total managed receivables was as follows as of the end of each of the last three years   
the following table illustrates ford credit s term public funding issuances for and and its planned issuances for in billions forecast unsecured term debt institutional retail total unsecured term debt term public securitization total term public funding reflects new issuance  excludes asset sales to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers  whole loan sales  and other structured financings 
the cost of both debt and funding in securitizations is based on a margin or spread over a benchmark interest rate  such as interest rates paid on u 
s 
treasury securities of similar maturities 
over the last two years  spreads on ford credit s securitized funding have fluctuated between and basis points above comparable us treasury securities  while ford credit s unsecured long term debt funding spreads have fluctuated between and basis points above comparable us treasury securities 
in  ford credit s unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between and basis points above comparable us treasury securities  with an average spread of basis points and a year end spread of basis points above comparable us treasury securities 
ford credit also continued its program to sell retail installment sale contracts in transactions where it retains no interest and thus no exposure to the sold contracts 
these transactions  which we refer to as whole loan sale transactions  provide liquidity by enabling ford credit to reduce its managed receivables and its need for funding to support those receivables 
in  ford credit sold billion of retail finance receivables through whole loan sales 
as a result of ford credit s funding strategy and the reduction in its managed receivables  the lowering of its credit ratings over the past three years has not had a material impact on ford credit s ability to fund its operations  although lower credit ratings have contributed to an increase in its overall borrowing costs 
in  its funding strategy continued to focus on maintaining liquidity and access to diversified funding sources that are cost effective 
any further lowering of its credit ratings may increase ford credit s borrowing costs and potentially constrain its funding sources 
this could likely cause ford credit to increase its use of securitization or other sources of liquidity or to reduce 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued its managed receivables 
ford credit s ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell  the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions  general demand for the type of receivables ford credit offers  market capacity for ford credit sponsored investments  accounting and regulatory changes  ford credit s debt ratings and ford credit s ability to maintain back up liquidity facilities for certain securitization programs 
if as a result of any of these or other factors  the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to ford credit  its liquidity would be adversely impacted 
for additional funding and to maintain liquidity  ford credit and its majority owned subsidiaries including fce have contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled approximately billion at december  approximately billion of the total facilities were in use at december  additionally  at december   banks provided billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities that supported two asset backed commercial paper programs established by ford credit 
ford credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers under which such issuers in the aggregate are committed to purchase from ford credit  at ford credit s option  up to billion of receivables 
for further discussion of these facilities and agreements  see note of the notes to financial statements 
leverage 
ford credit uses leverage  or the debt to equity ratio  to make various business decisions  including establishing pricing for retail  wholesale and lease financing  and assessing its appropriate capital structure 
ford credit calculates leverage on a financial statement basis and on a managed basis using the following formulas total debt financial statement leverage equity retained interest in securitized securitized off balance off balance cash sfas no 
sheet sheet and cash adjustments total debt receivables receivables equivalents on total debt managed leverage equity minority sfas no 
interest adjustment on equity the following table illustrates the calculation of ford credit s financial statement leverage in billions december  total debt total stockholder s equity debt to equity ratio to at december   ford credit s financial statement leverage was to  compared with to a year ago 
this increase in leverage resulted primarily from the accounting consolidation of fcar resulting in billion of fcar s debt reported on ford credit s balance sheet at december  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table illustrates the calculation of ford credit s managed leverage in billions december  total debt securitized off balance sheet receivables outstanding retained interest in securitized off balance sheet receivables adjustments for cash and cash equivalents adjustments for sfas no 
total adjusted debt total stockholder s equity including minority interest adjustments for sfas no 
total adjusted equity managed debt to equity ratio to ford credit believes that managed leverage  which is the result of adjustments to its financial statement leverage  is useful to its investors because it reflects the way ford credit manages its business 
ford credit retains interests in receivables sold in off balance sheet securitization transactions  and with respect to subordinated retained interests  is exposed to credit risk 
accordingly  ford credit considers securitization as an alternative source of funding and evaluates credit losses  receivables and leverage on a managed as well as a financial statement basis 
ford credit also deducts cash and cash equivalents because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support its operations 
in addition  ford credit adds its minority interests to its financial statement equity  because all of the debt of such consolidated entities is included in its total debt 
sfas no 
requires ford credit to make fair value adjustments to its assets  debt and equity positions to reflect the impact of interest rate instruments ford credit uses in connection with its term debt issuances and securitizations 
sfas no 
adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market interest rates 
ford credit generally repays its debt funding obligations as they mature 
as a result  ford credit excludes the impact of sfas no 
on both the numerator and denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  the managed leverage measure provides ford credit s investors with meaningful information regarding management s decision making processes 
ford credit s managed leverage strategy involves establishing a leverage level that it believes reflects the risk characteristics of its underlying assets 
in establishing a target leverage level  ford credit considers the characteristics of the receivables in its managed portfolio and the prevailing market conditions 
at december   ford credit s managed leverage was to  compared with to a year ago 
ford credit s dividend policy is based in part on its strategy to maintain managed leverage at the lower end of the to range 
as a result of improved profitability and lower managed receivable levels  ford credit paid dividends of billion in hertz hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment  which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment 
hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers 
the financing requirements of hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry 
hertz fleet size  and its related financing requirements  generally peak in the summer 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued months  and decline during the winter months 
hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs 
hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs  and also draws from bank lines  as a normal business practice  to fund international needs 
hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets 
hertz has an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources 
as of december   million was outstanding under this program 
at december   hertz had committed credit facilities totaling billion 
of this amount  billion represented global and other committed credit facilities million of which are available through june  and million of which have various maturities of up to four years  million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by ford  which currently expires in june  million consisted of asset backed letters of credit  and million consisted of day asset backed commercial paper facilities 
total company stockholders equity 
our stockholders equity was billion at december   up billion compared with the level at december  the increase in stockholders equity reflected primarily the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments and a reduction in our minimum pension liability

pension 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world 
pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw  under which most of our us hourly employees are covered  we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension benefits to retirees covered by the contract 
these obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in note of the notes to our financial statements and under critical accounting estimates below 
based on present assumptions and benefit agreements  we expect our worldwide pre tax pension expense to be about million  which is about million lower than it was in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued included in our stockholders equity was a billion adjustment for our worldwide minimum pension liability as of december this was billion better than the adjustment due to the improvement in the funded status of our worldwide pension plans ie  the amount by which the present value of projected benefit obligations exceeded the market value of pension plan assets as of december   compared with december  the primary factor that contributed to the improvement in the funded status was an increase in the actual return on plan assets for  partially offset by decreases in the discount rates at december  used to calculate the present value of benefit obligations  in each case compared with the prior year

for us plans  the shortfall as of december   was billion  for a total worldwide shortfall of billion 
pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns  discount rates  actuarial assumptions  and benefit levels which can be contractually specified  such as those under the ford uaw retirement plan 
if these assumptions were to remain unchanged  we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major us pension plans before however  we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required 
for example  in we made over billion of discretionary cash contributions to our us pension funds 
further  after giving effect to these contributions  based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions  we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the pension benefit guaranty corporation before for information related to our expenses and liabilities with respect to health care benefits we provide to our employees and retirees  see overview key economic factors and trends affecting automotive industry health care expenses above and critical accounting estimates other postretirement benefits retiree health care and life insurance below

each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk  and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency

critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
warranty and additional service actions see notes and of the notes to our financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions 
nature of estimates required 
the estimated warranty and additional service action costs are accrued for each vehicle at the time of sale 
estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line  where little or no claims experience may exist 
in addition  the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved  and policies related to additional service actions  are taken into consideration 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors  changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income 
assumptions and approach used 
our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile  therefore  our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
pensions see note of the notes to financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
nature of estimates required 
the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets assumption reflects asset allocation  investment strategy and the views of investment managers and of other large pension plan sponsors regarding the market 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods

nature of estimates required 
the measurement of our obligations  costs and liabilities associated with other postretirement benefits ie  retiree health care and life insurance requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases  salary increases and demographic experience  which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments 
assumptions and approach used

 health care cost trends total expense health care cost trends service and interest expense allowance for credit losses see note of the notes to financial statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements 
we exercise judgment in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time  and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain 
nature of estimates required 
we estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors using econometric models 
these factors include historical credit loss trends  the credit quality of our present portfolio  trends in historical and projected used vehicle values  and general economic measures 
assumptions and approach used 
we use the factors listed above to make projections of two key assumptions frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time  measured principally by the repossession rate the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period  typically a year  divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period  and loss severity the expected difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive  net of expenses  from selling the repossessed vehicle  including any recoveries from the customer 
we use these assumptions to assist us in setting our allowance for credit losses 
sensitivity analysis 
we believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses adequately reflects probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases 
however  changes in the assumptions used to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses 
over the past twenty years  repossession rates for our us retail and lease portfolio have varied between and

accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases financial services sector see note of the notes to financial statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases 
accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date  reducing the value of the leased vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their estimated residual value estimated proceeds from the sale of the vehicle at auction at the end of the lease term 
nature of estimates required 
each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer 
when we purchase the lease  we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle 
we exercise judgment in estimating the residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict 
we depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value 
we monitor residual value performance by vehicle line each month and we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis 
if we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased  we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that our net investment in the operating leases equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles minus accumulated depreciation will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term 
such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining life of the affected vehicles in our portfolio 
each lease customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer 
the dealer has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us 
for returned vehicles  we face a risk that the amount we obtain from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than our most recent estimate of the residual value for the vehicle 
over the last five years  about to of ford credit north america s operating lease vehicles have been returned to us 
assumptions and approach used 
our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions residual value the market value of the vehicles when we sell them at the end of the lease 
return rates the percentage of vehicles that will be returned to us at lease end 
we estimate residual values and return rates using econometric models 
these models use historical auction values  historical return rates for our leased vehicles  industry wide used vehicle prices  our marketing plans and vehicle quality data 
sensitivity analysis 
the largest impact of changes in assumptions is on ford credit s us retail operating leases of ford  lincoln and mercury brand vehicles 
if future auction values for 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued all of the ford  lincoln  and mercury vehicles in our us operating lease portfolio at year end were to decrease by per unit from our present estimates  the total impact would be to increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about million  which would be charged to depreciation expense during the through period so that the net investment in operating leases at the end of the lease term for these vehicles is equal to the revised residual value 
similarly  if future return rates for our existing portfolio of ford  lincoln and mercury vehicles in the us were to increase by one percentage point from our present estimates  the total impact would be to increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about million in the through period 
adjustments to the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet as net investment in operating leases and on the income statement in the depreciation line  in each case under the financial services sector 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
these include guarantees  sales of receivables by ford credit  and variable interest entities  each of which is discussed below 
guarantees see also note of the notes to financial statements occasionally  we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth 
as of december   our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was million 
in the ordinary course of business  we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction 
these indemnifications include claims for any of the following environmental  tax  and shareholder matters  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and employment related matters  financial matters  and dealer  supplier  and other commercial contractual relationships 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
sales of receivables by ford credit securitizations ford credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations 
ford credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient securitization market provides ford credit with a cost effective source of funding  compared with unsecured debt given ford credit s present debt ratings 
in a typical securitization transaction  ford credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes an spe  usually a trust  and transfers the receivables to the spe in exchange for proceeds from interest bearing securities  commonly called asset backed securities  that are issued by the spe and are secured by future collections on the sold receivables 
following the transfer of the sold receivables to the spe  and assuming compliance with sfas no 
discussed below  the receivables are no longer assets of ford credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet 
the securities issued by the spe are structured into senior and subordinated classes 
the senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization and cash reserve funds 
these securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following chart diagrams ford credit s typical securitization transaction chart consistent with conventional practices in the securitization industry  ford credit uses spes in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors 
most of the spes used in ford credit s securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities 
when these accounting rules are met  the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet 
the use of spes in the typical securitization structure shown above  along with the use of various forms of credit and payment enhancements to reduce the risk of loss as discussed below  allows the spe to issue senior asset backed securities that generally receive the highest short term debt ratings and among the highest long term debt ratings  thereby providing ford credit with a cost effective source of funding 
ford credit also sponsors one securitization program  fcar owner trust fcar  which does not use qualifying spes under sfas no 
in the second quarter of  ford credit purchased a portion of equity interests in fcar from unaffiliated parties for million 
as a result of this transaction  fcar s assets  liabilities and results of operations were consolidated into our financial statements 
the effects of this transaction are more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements 
ford credit selects receivables at random for securitization transactions using selection criteria designed for the specific transaction 
the selection criteria are generally based on factors such as location of the obligor  contract term  payment schedule  interest rate  financing program  and the type of financed vehicle 
in general  the criteria also require receivables to be active and in good standing 
ford credit often retains interests in the securitized receivables 
the retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities  undivided interests in wholesale receivables  restricted cash held for the benefit of the spes for example  a reserve fund and interest only strips 
subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the spes 
restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to spe investors and  after investors are fully paid  remaining cash is returned to ford credit 
interest only strips  also referred to as excess spread  represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the spe to pay interest and principal to investors  servicing fees and other required payments 
because ford credit typically retains the most subordinated interests in the spe  including subordinated securities  the right to receive excess spread interest only strip and any residual or remainder interests of the spe after all asset backed securities are repaid in full  ford credit s retained interests will be the first to absorb any credit losses on the sold receivables 
because the credit enhancements are structured to protect the holders of the senior asset backed securities in highly stressed receivables performance scenarios  the impact of credit losses in the pool of sold receivables will likely be limited to ford credit s retained interests in terms of the timing and total amount of excess spread it receives 
therefore  related to receivables sold in securitizations  ford credit retains credit risk up to the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amount of subordinated interests it retains in securitizations 
if the receivables were not securitized  ford credit s risk related to credit losses would not be limited as it is in securitizations 
at december  and  the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by ford credit in securitizations was billion and billion  respectively 
this decrease reflected primarily the reacquired receivables following consolidation of fcar now reported on our balance sheet as discussed above and the slower pace of securitizations in at december  and  ford credit s retained interests in such sold receivables were billion and billion  respectively 
ford credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default 
the holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to ford credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require ford credit to repurchase their securities 
ford credit does not guarantee any securities issued by spes 
however  as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions  ford credit  as the seller of the finance receivables to the spe and servicer of such receivables  is obligated to provide certain support obligations 
these include indemnification of the spe and its trustees  the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer  the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls 
based on its experience  ford credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments 
in  ford credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of receivables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about million for all retail securitization programs 
risks to future sales of receivables some of ford credit s securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on ford credit s overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels 
ford credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables 
in addition  ford credit s ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell  the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions  general demand for the type of receivables ford credit offers  market capacity for ford credit sponsored investments  accounting and regulatory changes  ford credit s debt ratings and ford credit s ability to maintain back up liquidity facilities for certain securitization programs 
if as a result of any of these or other factors  the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to ford credit  ford credit s operations  financial condition and liquidity would be adversely impacted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview we are exposed to a variety of market and other risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates  as well as risks to availability of funding sources  hazard events  and specific asset risks 
these risks affect our automotive and financial services sectors differently 
we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which includes regular reports to a central management committee  the global risk management committee grmc 
the grmc is chaired by our chief financial officer  and its members include our treasurer  our controller  and the chief financial officer of ford credit

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued our automotive and financial services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk  or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable 
we  and particularly ford credit  which comprises substantially all of our financial services sector  maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles 
as discussed in greater detail in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our funding sources include commercial paper  term debt  sales of receivables through securitization transactions  committed lines of credit from major banks  and other sources 
we are exposed to a variety of insurable risks  such as loss or damage to property  liability claims  and employee injury 
we protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses 
direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our treasurer s office and is governed by written polices and procedures 
separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades  the transaction of derivatives  and the settlement of cash flows 
regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective 
in addition  our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the grmc and the audit committee of our board of directors 
in accordance with corporate risk management policies  we use derivative instruments  such as forward contracts  swaps and options that economically hedge certain exposures foreign currency  commodity  and interest rates 
derivative positions are used to manage underlying exposures  we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
in certain instances  we forgo hedge accounting  which results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized currently in net income  examples of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting include foreign currency hedges of inter company loans and dividends and certain transactions that use multiple hedge instruments 
for additional information on our derivatives  see note of the notes to financial statements 
the market and counterparty risks of our automotive sector and ford credit are discussed and quantified below 
automotive market and counterparty risk our automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies  including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends  and investments in foreign operations 
these expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
we also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our automotive sector and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying cash flow exposures being hedged 
our earnings at risk ear methodology is based on transaction exposure  which is the exposure that results from specific transactions and our related hedging activity 
the methodology does not attempt to assess the impact on financial statement earnings resulting from non cash flow risks eg  re measurement of foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities through income 
ear at a confidence level is the methodology used to calculate the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to cash flows in foreign currency and commodity price exposure 
the calculation of ear combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies or commodity prices 
this creates 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued hypothetical prices based on the calculation of historical volatilities 
the ear methodology includes our hedging actions as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to assets  liabilities  investments in foreign operations  and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in our hedging actions  we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk eg  forward contracts and options 
at december   the ear from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is projected at less than million  within a confidence level for the unhedged exposure 
when calculated at the end of each quarter throughout the year  the high was million  the low was million and the average was million  the risks impacting financial instruments are offset with underlying exposure being hedged 
the year end projection is approximately million lower than the ear projection for calculated as of december  the decreased exposure results primarily from more diversification benefit due to lower correlation among major currency pairings 
the effect of currency movements on business units will vary based on the currency profile of the business unit including any hedging actions taken 
it can also be affected by competitive responses to currency changes 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities  such as non ferrous metals eg  aluminum and precious metals eg  palladium  platinum and rhodium  ferrous alloys eg  steel  energy eg  natural gas and electricity  and plastics resins eg  polypropylene  which we use in the production of motor vehicles 
we use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge 
in our hedging actions  we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk eg  financially settled forward contracts  swaps  and options 
based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying commodities exposures at december   the ear from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is projected at less than million  within a confidence level when calculated at the end of each quarter throughout the year  the high was million  the low was million and the average was million  the risks impacting financial instruments are offset with underlying exposure being hedged 
the year end level is approximately million higher than the ear projection for calculated as of december  the drivers of this increase are higher commodity price levels  price volatilities and exposures 
where derivative instruments do not exist or do not provide a highly correlated hedge  our purchasing organization negotiates contracts mitigating price risk eg  steel and resins which are approved by the grmc 
interest rate risk interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur in our automotive investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates 
our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolio includes cash and cash equivalents  marketable and loaned securities and short term veba assets 
at december   we had billion in cash  compared to billion at december  we invest our cash in securities of various types and maturities  the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
these securities are generally classified as trading

the trading portfolio gains and losses unrealized and realized are reported in the income statement 
the available for sale portfolio realized gains or losses are reported in the income statement  and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income 
the investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity  minimize risk  and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our trading and our available for sale portfolios 
as of december   the value of our trading portfolio was billion including assets contained in a short term veba trust  which is billion higher than december  the value of our available for sale portfolio was billion  which is unchanged from december  assuming a hypothetical  instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the value of our trading and available for sale portfolios would be reduced by million and million  respectively 
this compares to million and million  respectively  as calculated as of december  while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario  actual results could differ from those projected 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
counterparty risk counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract 
we enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk 
exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price risk 
we  together with ford credit  establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification 
our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the grmc 
our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive  allowing us to take risk mitigation actions 
we establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure  based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities 
the exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures 
we use a monte carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor  defined at a confidence level 
substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single a or better 
ford credit market risks overview ford credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities 
in addition to counterparty risk discussed above  ford credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results 
credit risk the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by ford credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than the depreciated values ie  residual values of those vehicles 
liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner 
each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to ford credit s overall global risk 
business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks 
credit and residual risks are discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption critical accounting estimates and liquidity risk is discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption liquidity and capital resources financial services sector ford credit 
the following discusses ford credit s market risks foreign currency risk 
to meet funding objectives  ford credit issues debt or  for its international affiliates  draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies 
ford credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables 
when possible  receivables are funded with debt in the same currency  minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements 
when a different currency is used  ford credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives 
these derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables 
as a result  ford credit s market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which ford credit is exposed and consists principally of re pricing risk or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an instrument s re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates 
it refers to the time it takes an instrument s interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates 
for fixed rate instruments  the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instrument s principal because  with a fixed interest rate  the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument 
for a floating rate instrument  the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate 
for instance  a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on december st would have a re pricing period of one year on january st  regardless of the instrument s maturity 
ford credit s receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables 
fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract 
ford credit s funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations 
in the case of unsecured term debt  and in an effort to have funds available throughout the business cycles  ford credit may borrow at terms longer than the term of its assets  with five to ten year maturities 
these debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity 
ford credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt 
specifically  without derivatives  ford credit s assets would re price more quickly than its debt 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued ford credit s interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates 
ford credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps 
on a monthly basis  ford credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities its economic value to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows  discounted by market interest rates  and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
ford credit then enters into interest rate swaps  effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating  to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range 
ford credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using pre tax net interest income simulation techniques 
these simulations calculate the projected pre tax net interest income of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios  including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve 
these quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the treasurer 
the process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of ford credit s operations in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  which together represented approximately of its total on balance sheet finance receivables at december  for its international affiliates  ford credit uses a technique commonly referred to as gap analysis  to measure re pricing mismatch 
this process uses re pricing schedules  which group assets  debt  and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period 
under this process  ford credit enters into interest rate swaps  effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt  to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance 
as a result of its interest rate risk management process  including derivatives  ford credit s debt re prices faster than its assets 
other things equal  this means that during a period of rising interest rates  the interest rates paid on ford credit s debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets  thereby initially reducing ford credit s pre tax net interest income 
correspondingly  during a period of falling interest rates  ford credit s pre tax net interest income would be expected to initially increase 
to provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre tax net interest income to changes in interest rates  ford credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical  instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities  as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels 
the differences between these scenarios and the base case over a twelve month period represent an estimate of the sensitivity of ford credit s pre tax net interest income 
this sensitivity as of year end and is as follows pre tax net interest pre tax net interest income impact given a income impact given a one percentage point one percentage point instantaneous instantaneous increase decrease in interest rates in interest rates in millions in millions december  december  while the sensitivity analysis presented is ford credit s best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios  actual results could differ from those projected 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
had the analysis assumed a gradual change in interest rates of basis points  it would have resulted in a lower pre tax net interest income impact 
the model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions  particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal  refinancing of maturing debt  and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity 
the fair value of net derivative financial instruments derivative assets less derivative liabilities as of december  as reported in note of the notes to financial statements was billion  approximately billion higher than a year ago 
this increase primarily reflects the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar which increases the value of receive euro pay us dollar cross currency swaps and the decrease in us interest rates which increases the value of our pay floating receive fixed rate swaps
