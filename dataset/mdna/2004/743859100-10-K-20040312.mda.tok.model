item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review the principal objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of provident bankshares corporation and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes as well as the other information herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of the corporation  which are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates estimates on an on going basis  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  non accrual loans  asset prepayment rates  other real estate owned  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  intangible assets  pension and post retirement benefits  stock based compensation  derivative positions  recourse liabilities  litigation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  asset prepayment rates and income taxes 
each estimate is discussed below 
the financial impact of each estimate  to the extent significant to financial results  is discussed in the applicable sections of management s discussion and analysis 
it is at least reasonably possible that each of the corporation s estimates could change in the near term and the effect of the change could be material to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses the allowance  which is intended to be management s best estimate of probable inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
the provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance to a level considered necessary by management 
the allowance is based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio 
this process provides an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
to arrive at the allocated component of the allowance  the corporation combines estimates of the allowances needed for loans analyzed individually and on a pooled basis 
the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component 
the portion of the allowance that is allocated to individual internally criticized and non accrual loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each problem credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
management emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits 
credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio 
the corporation s lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
a loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
for portfolios such as consumer loans  commercial business loans and loans secured by real estate  the determination of the allocated allowance is conducted at an aggregate  or pooled  level 
each quarter  historical rolling loss rates for homogenous pools of loans in these portfolios provide the basis for the allocated reserve 
for any portfolio where the bank lacks sufficient historic experience  industry loss rates are used 
if recent history is not deemed to reflect the inherent losses existing within a portfolio  older historic loss rates during a period of similar economic or market conditions are used 
the bank s credit administration group adjusts the indicated loss rates based on qualitative factors 
factors that are considered in adjusting loss rates include risk characteristics  credit concentration trends and general economic conditions  including job growth and unemployment rates 
for commercial and real estate portfolios  additional factors include the level and trend of watched and 
table of contents criticized credits within those portfolios  commercial real estate vacancy  absorption and rental rates  and the number and volume of syndicated credits  construction loans  or other portfolio segments deemed to carry higher levels of risk 
upon completion of the qualitative adjustments  the overall allowance is allocated to the components of the portfolio based on the adjusted loss factors 
the unallocated component of the allowance exists to mitigate the imprecision inherent in management s estimates of expected credit losses and includes its judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors that may not have been fully considered in the allocated allowance 
the relationship of the unallocated component to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
although management has allocated the majority of the allowance to specific loan categories  the evaluation of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
lending management meets at least monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and at least quarterly with executive management to evaluate the allowance 
the corporation has an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality and reports the results of its reviews to executive management and the board of directors 
such reviews also assist management in establishing the level of the allowance 
management believes that it uses the best information available to make determinations about the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
the bank is examined periodically by the fdic and  accordingly  as part of this exam  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy utilizing specific guidelines 
based upon their review  the regulators may from time to time require reserves in addition to those previously provided 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
asset prepayment rates the corporation purchases amortizing loan pools and investment securities in which the underlying assets are residential mortgage loans subject to prepayments 
the actual principal reduction on these assets varies from the expected contractual principal reduction due to principal prepayments resulting from borrowers elections to refinance the underlying mortgages based on market and other conditions 
the purchase premiums and discounts associated with these assets are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated life of the related assets 
the estimated life is calculated by projecting future prepayments and the resulting principal cash flows until maturity 
prepayment rate projections utilize actual prepayment speed experience and available market information on like kind instruments 
the prepayment rates form the basis for income recognition of premiums or discounts on the related assets 
changes in prepayment estimates may cause the earnings recognized on these assets to vary over the term that the assets are held  creating volatility in the net interest margin 
prepayment rate assumptions are monitored and updated monthly to reflect actual activity and the most recent market projections 
income taxes the corporation accounts for income taxes under the asset liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period indicated by the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable 
the judgment about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may  at least in part  be beyond the bank s control 
it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 

table of contents financial condition at december   total assets were billion  up from billion at december  the corporation continued to evolve the composition of the balance sheet by focusing resources on growth in core business lines  resulting in a higher percentage of core loans and deposits  while non core loan and deposit balances continued to decline 
in  average core loans represent of total average loans and average core deposits represent of total average deposits  evidencing the substantial progress made in the transition to a core based balance sheet 
on november   the corporation announced the acquisition of southern financial bancorp  inc of warrenton  virginia 
the addition of southern financial s franchise supports the bank s strategy to expand in the virginia and metropolitan washington markets 
the acquisition is also expected to complement the bank s strategy to enhance its consumer and commercial business lines  as southern financial s commercial banking strength will be combined with provident s proven ability to attract consumer loans and low cost deposits 
transition and integration activities are in process and on schedule  as are the necessary filings and notices with the securities and exchange commission and various regulatory bodies 
the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of asset composition the following table summarizes the composition of the bank s average earning assets for the periods indicated 
average earning assets year ended december  dollars in thousands variance variance investments other earning assets core loans consumer commercial business commercial real estate total core loans non core loans consumer national syndicated loans total non core loans total loans total average earning assets management defines core loans as all currently marketed loans originated by the bank and participations within the bank s defined market area 
total average earning assets increased by million  or  to billion in while total average loan balances were flat at billion  the mix changed favorably as the corporation was able to shift cash flows from non core loans into core loans 
a million decrease in average non core loan balances was partially offset by a million increase in average core loan balances 
average investment portfolio balances increased by million utilizing the excess non core cash flows 
investments and core loans represent of total average earning assets in  a improvement from the corporation s expanded presence in the baltimore washington metropolitan regions helped achieve a growth in average core loans 
the average core loan growth of million was evenly split between consumer and commercial loans 
average core consumer loans  comprised of direct consumer and marine loans  increased million  or  in production of direct consumer loans  primarily home equity loans and lines generated by the bank s retail banking offices  phone center and internet unit  totaled million in  and was greater than production 
the strong production in the current year resulted in a million net increase in average home equity loan and line balances to million 
average core consumer loan balances from the washington market grew in  reflecting the bank s continued expansion into that market 
marine loans  which are originated indirectly through brokers but underwritten individually by the bank  also had strong performance  with average marine loan balances up to million in average core commercial business  real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans also continued to show steady growth  evidenced by an increase of million  or  in the growth in average core commercial loans was evenly balanced by region  with growth of in the washington market and in the baltimore market 

table of contents consistent with the execution of its key strategies  the corporation s average non core loan balances continued to decline significantly  decreasing million  or  in the largest component of non core consumer loans is the portfolio of acquired residential mortgage loans consisting of first mortgages  home equity loans and lines  that declined by million to an average balance of million for the year 
in  the corporation purchased million in loans secured by residential real estate  all of which were in first lien position  including million in loans to borrowers residing in the bank s footprint 
provident will service the loans within its footprint in order to cultivate additional relationships with the borrowers 
the purchases offset payoffs of million that occurred in the portfolio during the year 
additionally  in november  the corporation desecuritized million in remaining fannie mae security balances and transferred the underlying loans back to the acquired portfolio 
management intends to continue to purchase residential loans to maintain an average acquired portfolio size between million and million 
the other non core consumer portfolios  consisting of residential mortgage and indirect auto loan product lines that are no longer offered by the bank  declined million in non core syndicated portfolio average balances declined million  or  in the remaining million average balances of non core syndicated loans represent a diversified portfolio of loans which are performing as agreed and amortizing according to their terms and conditions 
as a result of management s focus on lending within its market area  the corporation only selectively participates in new syndicated loans 
the growth in the investment portfolio average balances of million in primarily occurred as excess cash flow generated by non core loan portfolio payments  net of core loan funding requirements  was reinvested into the investment portfolio 
cash flows were predominately invested in a combination of year conventional mbs and hybrid arms  as well as floating rate asset backed securities  reducing duration risk 

table of contents asset quality the following table presents information with respect to non performing assets and day delinquencies for the years indicated 
asset quality summary december  dollars in thousands non performing assets consumer residential real estate mortgage commercial business residential real estate construction total non accrual loans commercial business total renegotiated loans non real estate assets land residential real estate total other assets and real estate owned total non performing assets day delinquencies consumer commercial business residential real estate mortgage commercial real estate mortgage total day delinquencies asset quality ratios non performing loans to loans non performing assets to loans consumer non accrual loans are comprised entirely of credits secured by residential property and other secured loans  primarily purchased loans 
consumer loans secured by nonresidential property and unsecured consumer loans are not placed in non accrual status but are charged off at and days  respectively 
the asset quality within the corporation s loan portfolios continued to remain strong in non performing assets were million at december   up slightly from the level at december  of the total  million are in the consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolios  which are collateralized by to family residences 
with the vast majority of non performing loans already written down to net fair value  management expects little further loss 
commercial non performing assets increased million in due to the addition of two loans 
at december   non performing assets as a percentage of loans outstanding were compared to at december  although no assurances can be given  management believes that non performing assets will remain relatively stable in the near term 
total day delinquencies decreased million in due to a decrease in delinquent residential mortgages 
delinquencies have declined consistently in the acquired mortgage portfolio comprised of first lien loans  reaching their lowest level in several years 
presented below is interest income that would have been recorded on all non accrual loans if such loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and the interest income on such loans that was actually received and recorded for the year 
interest income lost due to non accrual loans year ended december  in thousands contractual interest income due on loans in non accrual status during the year interest income actually received and recorded interest income lost on non accrual loans 
table of contents allowance for loan losses the following table reflects the allowance for loan losses and the activity during each of the periods indicated 
loan loss experience summary dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year transfer to other liabilities allowance of acquired company allowance related to securitized loans provision for loan losses loans charged off acquired residential mortgage residential real estate mortgage other consumer total consumer commercial business residential real estate construction total charge offs recoveries acquired residential mortgage residential real estate mortgage other consumer total consumer commercial business commercial real estate construction commercial real estate mortgage total recoveries net charge offs balance at end of year balances loans year end loans average ratios net charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to year end loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans the following table reflects the allocation of the allowance at december to the various loan categories 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any type of loan 
allocation of allowance for loan losses in thousands consumer commercial business residential real estate construction commercial real estate construction commercial real estate mortgage unallocated total allowance for loan losses 
table of contents as a result of the growth of the loan portfolio and the change in the relative risk within the portfolio  the corporation increased the level of the allowance by million from the december  level to million at december  the risk profile in the loan portfolio shifted due to the growth in the commercial portfolios which have greater risk than loans collateralized by residential mortgages 
the allowance represents of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans at december  portfolio wide net charge offs represented of average loans in  down from in for portfolios that experienced losses  the twelve month rolling loss rates in each of the portfolios were at their lowest levels in several years  reflecting both the favorable levels of delinquencies and management s attention to collection efforts 
management believes that the allowance at december  represents its best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio and that it uses the best information available to make such determinations 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
based on information currently available to the corporation  management believes it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
sources of funds the following table summarizes the composition of the corporation s average deposit and borrowing balances for the periods indicated 
average deposits and borrowings year ended december  dollars in thousands variance variance core deposits retail commercial total core deposits non core deposits total deposits borrowings fed funds fhlb borrowings repos and other trust preferred securities total borrowings total average deposits and borrowings in keeping with its strategy to reduce its reliance on wholesale funds  management made progress in shifting its deposit mix to low cost core consumer and commercial sources rather than expensive non core sources composed of brokered cds 
average non core deposits decreased million  or  from matured cds that were not replaced with non core funding 
as a result of the corporation s focus on its core business lines  average core deposits generated from the bank s consumer and commercial customer base continued to grow steadily  replacing million of the brokered cd runoff 
excluding average time deposit balances  which decreased million in  average non time deposit balances increased million  or  in deposit growth from the commercial sector was particularly strong during the year  with a net increase in average balances of million  or  in  of which million was in non interest bearing accounts 
regionally  core deposits increased in the washington market and in the baltimore market 
average borrowings increased million in average fed funds increased million  reflecting management s intentions to match fund more of the bank s prime based loan portfolio with these borrowings 
average fhlb borrowings increased million over months 
the bank extinguished million of term fhlb borrowings in at above market rates 
the debt was replaced with lower rate fhlb borrowings  which is expected to have a favorable impact on interest expense in the extinguishments generated a million realized loss in  which is shown in net gains losses in the consolidated statements of income 
in december  the corporation issued million of floating rate trust preferred securities in contemplation of its settlement of the pending southern financial acquisition 

table of contents liquidity an important component of the bank s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
the bank s asset liability management committee has established general guidelines for maintaining prudent levels of liquidity 
the committee continually monitors the amount and sources of available liquidity  and the time and cost required for obtaining it 
management believes the bank has sufficient liquidity to meet funding needs in the foreseeable future 
the bank s primary source of liquidity is the assets it possesses  which can be pledged as collateral for secured borrowings or alternatively sold to raise cash levels 
an objective of liquidity management is to optimize the use of this collateral to minimize funding costs 
the bank s primary sources for raising secured borrowings are the fhlb and securities broker dealers 
at december   billion of secured borrowings were employed  with sufficient collateral available to immediately raise an additional million 
after covering million of unsecured funds that mature in the next three months  the excess liquidity position of million is well in excess of projected liquidity requirements for the next months 
additionally  over million of assets are maintained as collateral with the federal reserve that is available as a contingent funding source 
the bank also has several unsecured funding sources available 
at december   the bank possessed over million of fed funds lines  of which only million were in use at year end 
brokered cds  which typically are more expensive than secured funds of a similar maturity  remain a viable funding alternative  however management has not used this source since in accordance with its strategy to reduce non core funding 
existing brokered cd average balances declined by million in brokered deposits maturing in the next months amount to million with million maturing in the following nine months 
the unsecured debt markets are also a potential alternative to raise funds but have not been employed since given the bank s ability to raise funds at lower interest rates in the secured funds markets 
as an alternative to raising secured funds  the bank can raise liquidity through asset sales 
at december   over million of the bank s investment portfolio was not pledged as collateral for borrowings  and is immediately saleable at a market value equaling or exceeding its amortized cost basis 
additionally  over a day time frame  a majority of the bank s billion consumer loan portfolio is saleable in an efficient market 
the corporation is a one bank holding company that relies upon the bank s performance to generate capital growth through bank earnings 
a portion of the bank s earnings is passed to the corporation in the form of cash dividends 
as a commercial bank under the maryland financial institution law  the bank may declare cash dividends from undivided profits or  with the prior approval of the commissioner of financial regulation  out of paid in capital in excess of of its required capital stock  and after providing for due or accrued expenses  losses  interest and taxes 
these dividends are utilized to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase shares and pay interest on trust preferred securities 
the corporation and the bank  in declaring and paying dividends  are also limited insofar as minimum capital requirements of regulatory authorities must be maintained 
the corporation and the bank comply with such capital requirements 
if the corporation or the bank were unable to comply with the minimum capital requirements  it could result in regulatory actions that could have a material impact on the corporation 
off balance sheet arrangements the corporation enters into certain transactions which may either contain risks or represent contingencies 
these risks or contingencies may take the form of recourse on assets sold to third parties  concentrations of credit risk  commitments to fund loans see below or exposure to litigation 
disclosure of these arrangements is found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
future contractual obligations the corporation enters into various contractual arrangements in the normal course of business 
each of these arrangements affect the bank s determination of sufficient liquidity 
arrangements to fund credit products or guarantee financing take the form of loan commitments including lines of credit on revolving credit structures and letters of credit 
approvals for these arrangements are obtained in the same manner as loans 
generally  cash flows  collateral value and a risk assessment are considered when determining the amount and structure of credit arrangements 
commitments to extend credit in the form of consumer  commercial real estate and business loans at december  were as follows 
in thousands commercial credit consumer revolving credit residential mortgage credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total loan commitments 
table of contents historically  many of the commitments expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
sources of funds are provided to the corporation in the form of certificates of deposit that are issued with various contractual maturity dates 
the contractual maturities of certificates of deposit at december  are shown in the following table 
contractual payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total certificates of deposit in addition to potential financing under credit arrangements and depository obligations  the corporation issues junior subordinated debt to wholly owned statutory trusts which then issue trust preferred securities as a source of long term funding to the corporation 
there have been three separate issues of trust preferred securities see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details  each of which bears a different rate of interest and which is callable at various dates 
the corporation also enters into term repurchase agreements and borrows funds from the fhlb 
these borrowings have amounts due at various intervals over years 
presented below are the funding requirements with respect to its borrowing arrangements at december  contractual payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total fhlb advances trust preferred securities term repurchase agreements total contractual payment obligations the corporation also enters into lease agreements for the majority of its banking and operations offices 
many of the lease arrangements exceed five years in term with extension provisions 
obligations also take the form of commitments to purchase loans 
at december   the corporation did not have any open commitments to purchase any loans 
presented below are the commitments of the corporation with respect to the lease obligations 
contractual payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total lease commitments market risk and interest rate sensitivity the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings and the market value of assets and liabilities are subject to fluctuations  which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize the fluctuation in the net interest margin caused by changes in interest rates using cost effective strategies and tools 
the bank manages several forms of interest rate risk 
the simplest involves the mismatch of maturities between fixed rate assets and liabilities 
a second risk  basis risk  exists as a result of having much of the bank s earning assets priced using either the prime rate or the us treasury yield curve  while much of the liability portfolio is priced using the cd yield curve or libor yield curve 
these different yield curves typically do not move in lock step with one another 
a third risk  options risk  exists in the form of prepayment volatility  that increases when long term interest rates  such as the year treasury note rate or the year mortgage rate  decline substantially 
prepayment volatility complicates funding strategies in which the goal is to maintain a stable spread between asset yields and borrowing rates 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that management performs continually to meet the objective of maintaining a stable net interest margin 
this process relies chiefly on simulation modeling of shocks to the balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios  including parallel and non parallel rate shifts  such as the forward yield curves for us treasuries and interest rate swaps 
the results of these shocks are measured in two forms first  the impact on the net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames  and second  the impact on the market value of equity 
there are several advantages of simulation analysis over traditional gap analysis 
in addition to measuring the basis risks and prepayment risks noted above  simulations also quantify the earnings impact of rate changes and the cost benefit of hedging strategies 

table of contents the following table shows the anticipated effect on net interest income in parallel shift up or down interest rate scenarios 
these shifts are assumed to begin on january  and evenly ramp up or down over a six month period 
the effect on net interest income would be for the year given the interest environment at december   a basis point drop in rate is unlikely and has not been shown 
interest rate scenario projected percentage change in net interest income basis points no change basis points basis points the isolated modeling environment  assuming no action by management  shows that the corporation s net interest income volatility is less than under probable single direction scenarios 
the corporation s one year forward earnings are slightly asset sensitive  which will result in net interest income moving in the same direction as future interest rates 
the corporation maintains an overall interest rate management strategy that incorporates structuring of investments  purchased funds  variable rate loan products  and derivatives in order to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings or market values 
the bank continues to employ hedges to mitigate interest rate risk 
borrowings totaling over million have been employed which reset their rates monthly or quarterly based on the level of long term interest rates specifically  the year constant maturity swap rate rather than short term rates  to offset the effect of mortgage prepayments on asset yields 
there is a high correlation between changes in the year constant maturity swap rate and the year mortgage rate 
additionally  million notional amount in interest rate swaps were in force to reduce interest rate risk  and million of interest rate caps were employed to protect the interest margin from rising interest rates in the future 
capital resources total stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million from december  the change in stockholders equity for the year was attributable to million in earnings and million from the issuance of common stock relating primarily to the exercise of stock options 
this was partially offset by dividends paid of million  or per share  and a decrease of million in net accumulated oci 
net accumulated oci represents non owner equity  including unrealized gains or losses on available for sale debt securities  unrealized gains or losses attributable to derivatives that will be accumulated with net income from operations  and any minimum pension liability adjustment 
in  oci decreased due primarily to a decline in market value of available for sale securities 
capital was also reduced by million from the repurchase of  shares of the corporation s common stock at an average price of 
the corporation is authorized to repurchase an additional  shares under its current authorization 
the corporation is required to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of core capital to adjusted quarterly average assets leverage ratio and of tier and total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets 
the actual regulatory capital ratios and required ratios for capital adequacy purposes under firrea and the ratios to be categorized as well capitalized under prompt corrective action regulations are summarized in the following table december  december  minimum regulatory requirements to be well capitalized tier leverage ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets the trust preferred securities issued by the corporation in december had the effect of increasing tier capital by million and total regulatory capital by million at december  without the transaction  which was executed in contemplation of the acquisition of southern financial  the corporation s leverage and total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets ratios would have been and  respectively  at december  
table of contents results of operations overview the corporation recorded net income of million or per diluted share in the financial results in  represented by increases of in net income and in diluted earnings per share  demonstrate stability and continued growth in the corporation s core businesses  as well as strong asset quality 
the corporation continued to show improvement in its financial fundamentals with its three key performance measures showing improvement over return on average common equity  return on assets and the efficiency ratio  were  and  respectively  in  compared to  and  respectively  in despite a very challenging rate environment  the net interest margin expanded from in to in these improvements reflect the corporation s commitment to produce positive core results by executing the business strategies of broadening its presence and customer base in the virginia and metropolitan washington markets  growing commercial business in all markets  and enhancing core business results in all markets 
an increase of million in the net interest margin and a decrease in income tax expense of million more than offset a million increase in non interest expense  resulting in a million increase in net income 
when it became apparent in the second quarter of that the corporation would be required to recognize one time tax benefits of million  management elected to reset a portion of its borrowing cost at beneficial rates by extinguishing million of debt at a corresponding loss of million 
these items are discussed in more detail  as follows 
net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income  for purposes of analysis  is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits 
this presentation provides a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the discussion of net interest income should be read in conjunction with the table on the following pages 
the table analyzes the reasons for the changes from year to year in the principal elements that comprise net interest income 
rate and volume variances presented for each component will not total the variances presented on totals of interest income and interest expense because of shifts from year to year in the relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

table of contents net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaled million in  compared to million in  while the net interest margin expanded to from 
a decline of million in total interest income was more than offset by a decline in total interest expense of million 
generally  favorable changes in the mix of interest bearing liabilities offset growth in earning assets at lower yields  primarily in the investment portfolio 
the yield on earning assets was in  compared to in  a decline of basis points  reflecting the low interest rate environment in the million decrease in total interest income was primarily attributable to two factors 
first  although the million higher core loan average balances generated an additional million in interest income  prepayments of higher yielding loans in those portfolios were replaced with lower yielding loans  causing a negative impact to interest income of million 
second  the million decline in the average balances of non core loans  and to a lesser extent the lower yield on the remaining portfolio  caused a million decrease in interest income 
the excess proceeds from these portfolios were deployed in investment securities at lower yields  resulting in a decrease in interest income of million 
interest income lost from non accruing loans was million in  compared to million in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points to in  versus in the favorable changes in deposit mix  from higher rate non core and retail cds into lower rate demand and savings deposits  had a favorable impact on interest expense of million 
interest expense benefited further from a million increase in average noninterest bearing deposit balances during the year 
while the higher level of average borrowings in caused an increase in interest expense of million  interest expense on borrowings benefited by million from the repricing of floating rate borrowings throughout the year and the resetting of rates on term fhlb borrowings via the extinguishment transactions during the year 
as a result of derivative transactions undertaken to mitigate the affect of interest rate risk on the bank  interest income decreased by thousand and interest expense decreased by thousand  for a total decrease of thousand in net interest income relating to derivative transactions for the year ending december  future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand  growth in deposits and the general level of interest rates 
provision for loan losses the corporation continued to emphasize quality underwriting as well as aggressive management of charge offs and potential problem loans 
as a result  the provision for loan losses was million in  exceeding net charge offs by million 
the slight increase in the provision resulted from lower charge offs and an increase in loan balances of million 
this was partially offset by the impact of an overall decrease in the allowance of basis points as compared to total loans  based upon the analytical process described previously 
net charge offs were million in compared to million in of the million decrease in net charge offs  million related to the acquired consumer loan portfolio and thousand related to commercial business loans

the improvement in non interest income continued to be driven by deposit service charges  which increased million  or  to million in the increase in deposit fees was primarily the result of continued strong retail and commercial deposit account growth 
one component of the bank s deposit service charges is revenues from its retail customers use of bank issued debit cards 
in june  mastercard  the bank s debit card issuer  announced new debit and credit retail interchange fees as a result of the settlement of litigation between merchants and visa and mastercard regarding debit card interchange reimbursement fees 
beginning in august  a revised retail debit card interchange structure resulted in a decrease in per transaction interchange revenue to the bank 
strong increases in the average number of active cards and average purchases per card somewhat mitigated the reduced per transaction revenue  resulting in flat net retail debit card revenues in the impact of a full year of reduced per transaction interchange revenue will be realized in  however management has specifically identified increases in other fee income  pricing opportunities and expense reductions that are expected to mitigate any shortfall 
commissions and fees were primarily generated from pic  the bank s wholly owned subsidiary which offers securities brokerage through an affiliation with a securities broker dealer  as well as insurance products as an agent 
commissions and fees of million were down slightly in due to compression in the commission rates received by pic 
other non interest income increased million to million  due to lease income from operating lease activities

higher rate term fhlb borrowings totaling million were extinguished at a loss of million and replaced with lower rate term fhlb borrowings 
the majority of net gains on the sales of securities were the result of re balancing the investment portfolio in anticipation of the heavy prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
to a lesser extent  net securities gains were realized on the sale of securities held specifically as part of asset liability strategies put in place to mitigate potential additional premium amortization due to mortgage loan prepayments
