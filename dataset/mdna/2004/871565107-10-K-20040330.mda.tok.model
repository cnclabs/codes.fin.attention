item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimate s under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a significant portion of the company s accounts receivable in the colors segment are from domestic customers in the textile industry  which has been in a steady decline over the last several years 
if the financial condition of these or any other customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as with the accounts receivable  a significant portion of the company s inventories in the colors segment are used by domestic customers in the textile industry 
in addition  most of the key raw materials are imported from asian countries which requires the company to maintain significant amounts of inventory for certain products in order to adequately service the colors segment s customers in a timely manner 
if the financial condition of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the elimination or reduction of their demand for our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as noted in note i to the consolidated financial statements  the company has accrued  in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  will satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note i 
as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and remedy of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
subject to the difficulty in estimating future environmental costs  the company believes that the likelihood of material losses in excess of the amounts recorded is remote 
however  any changes  including regulatory changes  may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
liquidity and capital resources the current ratio for the year ended january   was  which is up from the previous year end ratios of in and in working capital increased  to  and cash flows used in operations totaled  the increase in working capital and use of cash flows came primarily from increases in accounts receivable and inventories of  and  respectively  offset by an increase of  in accounts payable 
also contributing to the cash use was the net loss incurred of  offset by depreciation and amortization expense of  and the receipt of a  tax refund from prior years 
the increases in inventories  accounts receivable and accounts payable were generated from a combination of the acquisition of the rite industries assets by the colors segment  and increased sales activity in the metals segment discussed in the segment comparisons below 
an increase in line of credit bo rrowings of  funded the working capital increase along with capital expenditures of  the company expects that cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments and fund estimated capital expenditures of  and normal operating requirements 
on july   the company entered into a new credit agreement with a new lender to provide a  line of credit 
on july   the agreement was amended increasing the borrowing amount to  primarily under the existing terms  and extending the expiration date to july  borrowings under the agreement are limited to a borrowing base calculation including eligible accounts receivable  inventories  and cash surrender value of the company s life insurance as defined in the agreement 
as of january   the amount available for borrowing was  of which  was borrowed leaving  of availability 
covenants include  among others  a prohibi tion on the payment of dividends 
at january   the company was in violation of its earnings covenant for which the company received a waiver from its lender

metals segment the following table summarizes operating results and backlogs for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note r to the consolidated financial statements 
dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income loss special charges described below write down of inventories year end backlog piping systems comparison of to metals segment dollar sales increased percent for the year from the same period a year earlier 
the increase for the year resulted from percent higher average selling prices partially offset by six percent lower unit volumes 
surcharges paid on stainless steel raw materials increased throughout the year increasing from an average of about 
per pound in december to an average of about 
per pound in december the segment was able to pass through most of these cost increases  which accounted for most of the increase in selling prices  especially in the fourth quarter 
the increase in the year to date selling price also resulted from a change in product mix to a higher percentage of higher margin large diameter pipe  experienced primarily in the second and third quarters of the combination of higher selling prices and favorable product mix along with cost reductions implemented in the third quarter of contributed to the significant profit improvement experienced for the year compared to the same period of while commodity pipe generated operating income for the year  piping systems did not fare as well  incurring losses for the year consistent with piping systems backlog maintained a better than average level throughout the year  ending the year at  however  due to the customers scheduling requirements for our material  we were unable to get a sufficient amount of work in the shop from the backlog to enable piping systems to operate profitably through the first nine months 
the situation improved in the fourth quarter as piping systems was able to generate a modest profit for the quarter 
selling and administrative expense decreased  or nine percent  and declined slightly as a percentage of sales compared to as a result of cost reductions implemented in september of  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items  many of which impacted selling and administrative expense 
comparison of to metals segment dollar sales for were down eight percent as the result of an percent average decline in sales prices offset by a percent increase in unit volumes 
extremely competitive market conditions  together with a change in product mix  with a lower percentage of sales coming from higher priced fabricated piping systems  led to the fall in average selling prices 
the increase in volume came primarily from the increase in sales of lower margin smaller diameter commodity pipe 
the market conditions  together with the change in product mix had a significant effect on profits as the segment incurred an operating loss of  for compared to operating income of  in also contributing to the loss was the recording of a  charge in the second quarter of to write down inventory 
the company has historically sold off excess inventory slowly to avoid distressed pricing that would be required to dispose of the excess inventory more quickly 
with the price erosion that occurred over the first six months of the year and weak business conditions that existed  excess inventories were not reduced as much as planned 
most of the inventory write down was the result of excess inventories of fittings  flanges and special alloy pipe related to the piping systems business 
the unexpectedly low level of new orders impacted piping systems products to the extent that use of some of this inventory became uncertain 
therefore  excess inventories were written down to reflect management s estimate of the values that could be realized under a plan to scrap  sell or return the excess inventory as quickly as feasible 
although fabricated piping systems volume was down for  it improved slightly in the fourth quarter of compared to the first three quarters of the same year 
management achieved modest success in obtaining non stainless projects for fabricated piping systems during with most of the fourth quarter s sales coming from non stainless projects 
however  projects requiring stainless steel pipe  which is provided by the segment s pipe manufacturing plant  were significantly below prior years levels 
this reduction in volume through the pipe manufacturing plant impacted the absorption of operating costs which also contributed to the lack of profitability by the segment for the year 
selling and administrative expense decreased  or five percent in compared to the prior year 
however  it increased slightly as a percent of sales compared to the prior year as a result of the decline in sales in compared to beginning in september  cost reductions  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items  were implemented many of which impacted selling and administrative expense 
as a result  selling and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of declined to  or six percent of sales as compared to  or nine percent of sales for the same period of the previous year 
chemicals group the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note r to the consolidated financial statements 
specialty chemicals segment dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense long lived asset impairment cost operating income loss special charges described below write down of plant and equipment colors segment dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense minority interest in loss long lived asset impairment cost environmental remediation costs operating loss special charges described below write down of inventories write down of plant and equipment environmental remediation costs chemicals group dollar amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense minority interest in loss long lived asset impairment and environmental remediation costs operating loss comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales were up five percent and operating income increased percent for the year from as both of this segment s locations ended the year profitable 
the large increase in operating income was mostly due to a  impairment charge taken in discussed in the comparison of to below 
the segment was unable to pass higher operating costs  especially energy costs  to its customers which more than offset additional margin contribution received from the increased sales volume 
as a result  the segment experienced a reduction in gross profits for the year compared to the segment has been able to expand production at its spartanburg location by adding new products  which provides a better opportunity for the location to more evenly absorb manufacturing cost and avoid significant negative manufacturing variances this location has historically experienced 
this allowed the location to operate profitably for the year 
however  the location continu es to have significant swings in profitability from the timing of its contract tolling campaigns as it incurred losses in the first and fourth quarters of  while generating profits in the second and third quarters of selling and administrative expense for includes the impairment charge discussed below of  without the charge  selling and administrative expense declined  in compared to the adjusted total of  selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales declined to percent in compared to percent in the decline came from cost reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of  including reductions of personnel  many of which impacted selling and administrative expense 
comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales were up percent for as compared to and the segment had operating profits for of  including a  impairment charge as discussed in the comparison of to colors segment  compared to an operating loss of  for the improved performance was experienced at both of the segment s locations as both operations ended the year profitable 
several factors  including improved business conditions  increases in toll and other contract business compared to the prior year  and cost reductions implemented in the third quarter of  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items  led to the increase in sales and profits 
these factors were most prevalent in the last six months of as the segment had  of operating income compared to an operating loss of  for the first six months of selling and administrative expense for totaled  which is  above the amount primarily as a result of increased selling expenses from the acquisition of the dalton  georgia business in the third quarter of  offset by the cost reductions described above 
selling and administrative expenses as a percent of sales remained consistent at percent for and comparison of to colors segment sales increased percent for from the same period of reflecting the impact of acquiring certain assets of rite industries  inc rite on july  without the addition of rite s sales  revenues in the segment would have decreased percent for from the same period of reflecting the continued decline in the textile industry 
the acquisition of rite provides a significant amount of non textile dye sales   in  primarily to the paper industry 
during a transition period  the segment reimbursed rite for part of its operating costs at its plant in high point  north carolina where it blended and shipped dyes for the segment 
by the middle of november  production in high point was discontinued and the blending operation installed in the segment s spartanburg plant became fully operational 
the segment incurred significant non recurring costs transitioning the operations acquired from rite into the existing colors business a s the transition was more difficult than anticipated 
the segment also incurred  of bad debt expense for  primarily from accounts receivable write offs due to the bankruptcy of several customers 
the difficult transition performance and accounts receivable write offs  coupled with the impact from the deteriorated conditions in the textile industry  accounted for the majority of the segment s significant losses incurred for the year without including the charges recorded for writing down plant  equipment and inventory in both years as discussed below and in the comparison of to as a result of the continuing downward trends in the textile industry producing poor results for this segment  the company is downsizing its dye business servicing the textile industry 
the company has entered into an agreement  which is expected to close before the end of march  to sell the segment s liquid dye business comprised of vat  sulfur  liquid disperse and liquid reactive dyes with annual sales of approximately  several customers and related products serviced by the segment s remaining textile dye business have been rationalized 
the segment is reducing staff and eliminating applicable manufacturing and support functions 
at year end  a  pretax charge was recorded to write down inventories related to discontinuing affected product lines and  was recorded to write off impaired plant and equipment utilized by the liquid dye business 
the segment will continue to maintain several specialty dye products to service the textile industry  including the hosiery industry and certain other textile customers with which the segment has had long term relationships 
the segment s pigment business located in greensboro  north carolina  experienced a significant downturn in textile business during the last six months of incurring losses during that period 
although the non textile portion of the pigment business is growing  it is not expanding fast enough to offset the declining textile business 
the reduced volume did not produce sufficient contribution margin to offset operating costs causing the losses 
as a result of lost business  mainly from customers closing their operations  the location accumulated excessive inventories with few or no customers available to systematically sell off and or blend off the inventory 
as a result  a  inventory charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of also during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an impairment assessment on the plant and equipment located at greensboro and based on the results of the assessment  recorded a  impairment loss 
see note c to the co nsolidated financial statements 
selling and administrative expense increased  in over last year s amount and was percent of sales compared to percent 
the increases came from adding sales and administrative personnel from the acquisition of rite discussed above 
comparison of to colors segment sales declined percent in from reflecting the continuing contraction of the textile industry 
the operating loss for occurred primarily from the recording of an impairment charge of  described below  an inventory charge of  and an environmental charge of  all recorded in the second quarter of the poor sales performance also contributed to the loss  as market conditions continued to be extremely competitive  impacting margins and creating unabsorbed operating costs 
the segment implemented an aggressive inventory reduction program in the first two quarters of which also impacted profitability 
as previously stated  the company has historically sold off excess inventory slowly to avoid distressed pricing that would be required to dispose of the excess inventory more quickly 
with the price erosion that occurred over the first six months of and weak business conditions that existed  excess inventories were not reduced as much as planned and the inventory charge was recorded 
sales demand showed limited improvement in the third quarter and first half of the fourth quarter of in addition  cost reductions implemented at the beginning of september  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items had a positive impact on the last half of however  the limited improved sales activity diminished over the last half of the fourth quarter of the reduced sales volume caused the segment to incur an operating loss for the fourth quarter of the loss was disappointing since the segment had  of operating profit for the third quarter of after four consecutive quarters of operating losses 
the segment was able to generate  of cash flow for  resulting primarily from the inventory reduction program 
selling and administrative expense for totaled  which was  below the prior year s amount  primarily as a result of the cost reductions discussed previously 
however  selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales was percent which was one percent above the prior year s percentage due to the significant decline in sales 
the spartanburg plant  which includes the colors segment dye business and part of the specialty chemicals segment s operations  was substantially underutilized and generated operating losses in  primarily because of deteriorating market conditions 
the segments were able to minimize the operating losses for these operations through the first quarter of  and business plans for this facility anticipated positive cash flows for these operations going forward 
although the colors segment experienced a significant decline of textile dye sales in the first quarter of  management believed that this situation was temporary and seasonal and would not continue 
there were indications that conditions should improve in the near term  such as increases in month to month sales and sales order activity 
based on historical results and management s projections  the operations were expected to generate positive cash flows and did not support a write down at the end of the fir st quarter of although conditions improved slightly during the second quarter  there were sufficient new indications  including the unexpected loss of anticipated dye business  increases in pricing pressure from competitors  and reductions in expected revenues in the specialty chemicals segment s tolling business  to require management to revise its projections to better reflect what management believed were current market conditions 
after completing an analysis of the businesses  evaluations of the plant and equipment values at the site  completing projected cash flow calculations  and exploring other options that were available  it became apparent that the facility could not adequately recover costs related to the facility under current business conditions 
accordingly  an impairment charge of   related to the colors segment and  to the specialty chemicals segment  was recorded in the second quarter of to write down the plant and equipment reflecting the undiscounte d cash flow assessments

unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note r to the consolidated financial statements for the schedule that includes these items 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense increased  or seven percent to  for compared to the increase resulted primarily from an increase in directors fees and expenses 
in  the company began paying the directors retainer fees by issuing shares of its common stock  and issued  shares expensing  as retainer fees compared to  paid and expensed in other expense  net in included  of non recurring income received from the sale of the company s nasdaq stock symbol  and  in dividend income received from the company s life insurance policies  both recorded in the third quarter of other expense  net in included the sale of certain non operating assets  including its investment in a foreign corporation  for a pre tax gain of  interest expense in increased  from last year from increases in borrowings under the lines of credit with a lender 
comparison of to corporate corporate expense declined  or percent to  for compared to the decline resulted primarily from cost reductions implemented at the beginning of september  including reductions of personnel and non critical operating expense items 
other expense  net in declined  from s total 
the company sold certain non operating assets during  including its investment in a foreign corporation  for pre tax gains of  in the company recognized gains from the sale of its whiting plant in camden  south carolina of  and  from the partial sale of one of its investments 
interest expense in decreased  compared to from decreases in borrowings under the lines of credit with a lender 
interest income decreased  primarily from interest received in under a metals segment s contract with a customer 
current conditions and outlook metals segment s dollar sales increased percent for the fourth quarter of from the same period a year earlier 
the increase for the quarter resulted from eight percent higher average selling prices coupled with nine percent higher unit volumes 
the segment has been able to pass through most of the surcharge cost increases as discussed above  which accounted for most of the increase in selling prices in the fourth quarter 
piping systems work through the shop improved significantly in the fourth quarter of  allowing it to generate a modest profit for the quarter 
the combination of piping systems profitability and higher unit volumes and selling prices in commodity pipe contributed to the significant profit improvement experienced in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter of this segment is tied very closely to domestic capital spending 
although market conditions in this segment continue to be very competitive  sales activity  p ricing and unit volumes for commodity pipe have improved over the past several months  consistent with an apparent improvement in the construction industry 
management is optimistic about the current conditions that exist in the commodity pipe market 
if piping systems can continue to generate sufficient volume through its operations and the construction sector continues to improve  management believes this segment has a good chance to continue to operate profitably in  especially in the first six months  but there can be no assurance that this will occur 
specialty chemicals segment s sales increased three percent for the fourth quarter of from the same period of however  operating income declined percent 
the increase in sales for the fourth quarter of compared to the same period last year came from the cleveland location 
the spartanburg location experienced a decline in fourth quarter of sales from the timing of several contract campaigns 
the campaigns were completed by the end of the third quarter of compared to their running into the fourth quarter during  causing declines in sales and profits for the fourth quarter compared to the quarter 
the segment has been able to expand production in spartanburg by adding new products  which should help to reduce the significant swings in quarterly profits and losses historically experienced at this location 
management is encouraged by the performance of this segment and believes it is positioned to continue to grow from new product opportu nities 
this segment s business tends to be impacted by general economic conditions 
assuming no significant downturn in the general economy  management feels this segment has a good chance to continue to operate profitably in  especially in the first six months  but there can be no assurance that this will occur 
colors segment sales increased percent for the fourth quarter of from the same period of reflecting the impact of acquiring the rite assets 
without the addition of rite s sales  revenues in the segment would have decreased slightly for the quarter from the same period of the prior year 
the segment incurred  of bad debt expense for the fourth quarter of  primarily from accounts receivable write offs due to the bankruptcy of several customers 
the difficult transition performance up through november of and accounts receivable write offs  coupled with the impact of the deteriorated conditions in the textile industry  resulted in the segment incurring significant losses in the fourth quarter without including the charges recorded for writing down plant  equipment and inventory 
the company s color business has always been primarily dependent on the domestic textile industry 
it has proven to be impossible to avoid the fallout from the well chro nicled decline of this industry resulting from cheap imports 
management believes the downsizing of the textile portion of this segment s business will reduce its exposure to the inventory valuation and accounts receivable collection problems that have contributed to the operating losses incurred by this segment 
management believes that by focusing on the non textile dye business acquired from rite and the non textile pigment business  the segment has the potential to operate profitably going forward  but there can be assurance that this will occur
