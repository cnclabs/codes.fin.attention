overview immunomedics  inc is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes approximately issued patents in the united states and approximately other issued patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 
in addition to our potential therapeutic products  our proprietary technologies have also enabled us to develop highly specific diagnostic imaging agents  one of which  cea scan r  has been approved in the united states  canada and the european union  where it is currently being marketed for the detection of colorectal cancers 
our second diagnostic product  leukoscan r  has been approved in europe and australia  where it is currently being marketed for the detection of bone infections 
from inception in until june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and have never earned a profit 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we continue to conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following o the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  o our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  o the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  o the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and o many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
research and development as of june   we employed professionals in our research and development departments and professionals in our pre clinical and clinical research departments 
in addition to salaries and benefits  the other costs associated with research and development include the costs associated with producing biopharmaceutical compounds  laboratory equipment and supplies  the costs of conducting clinical trials  legal fees and expenses associated with pursuing patent protection  as well as facilities costs 
we spent million in the aggregate for the fiscal year ended june   on research and development expenses 
during fiscal year  we completed the construction of the manufacturing expansion at a total cost of million 
this expansion is being used to support our research and development efforts  as well as prepare for future commercialization of our product candidates 
we believe that our facilities  as expanded  will be adequate to support our research and development activities for the next few years without the need for any material capital expenditures 
at any one time our scientists are engaged in the research and development of multiple therapeutic compounds 
because we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation  but rather aggregate research and development costs for accounting purposes  it is not possible for investors to analyze and compare the expenses associated with unsuccessful research and development efforts for any particular fiscal period  with those associated with compounds that are determined to be worthy of further development 
this may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business and future prospects 
therapeutics we believe that each of our antibodies has therapeutic potential either when administered alone or when conjugated with therapeutic radioisotopes radiolabeled  chemotherapeutics or other toxins to create unique and potentially more effective treatment options 
the attachment of various compounds to antibodies is intended to allow the delivery of these therapeutic agents to tumor sites with greater precision than conventional radiation therapy or chemotherapeutic approaches 
this treatment method is designed to reduce the total exposure of the patient to the therapeutic agents  which ideally minimizes debilitating side effects 
we are currently focusing our efforts on unlabeled  or naked  antibodies  and antibodies conjugated with radioisotopes  such as yttrium  sometimes referred to as y  and iodine  sometimes referred to as i all of our therapeutic product candidates are humanized antibodies  which means the portion of the antibody derived from mouse murine dna sequences is generally less than 
epratuzumab our most advanced therapeutic product candidate  epratuzumab immu  is an unlabeled humanized antibody which targets an antigen  known as the cd marker  found on the surface of a certain class of lymphocytes  a type of white blood cell 
this antibody also binds to the malignant forms of these cells that comprise non hodgkin s b cell lymphoma and acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias 
the clinical trials of immu  which involved more than patients  demonstrated good safety  tolerability and anti tumor activity 
in december  we entered into a development and license agreement with amgen to license immu in north america and australia 
under this agreement  amgen was responsible for the final clinical development  manufacture and commercialization of immu for these markets 
amgen had conducted multiple clinical trials in north america and australia with immu for the treatment of non hodgkin s lymphomas with patients 
in some of these trials  immu was administered in combination with rituxan r  the first therapeutic antibody approved for treating cancer in the united states  with reported sales in excess of billion per year 
on april   we entered into a termination agreement with amgen whereby amgen returned to us all rights for epratuzumab 
as part of the transaction  we issued to amgen a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price equal to per share 
this warrant has an estimated value of approximately  if epratuzumab is approved for commercialization in the united states for non hodgkin s lymphoma therapy  the company will be required to pay amgen a milestone payment in the amount of  there are no other financial obligations between the parties as a result of the termination agreement 
we have recently also begun the evaluation of immu in patients with certain autoimmune diseases 
in may  clinical results of epratuzumab in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were presented at the th international congress on systemic lupus erythematosus sle 
epratuzumab was administered as a single agent in patients with sle 
patients with mild to moderate sle activity were enrolled 
sle assessments after treatment demonstrated consistent clinical improvement compared to the pre therapy scores 
the investigators concluded that these preliminary results in sle patients with mildly to moderately active disease indicate epratuzumab is well tolerated and can be infused in approximately one half hour  without evidence of reactions or immunogenicity 
early efficacy data suggests clinical improvement continuing for at least one month after treatment 
while the clinical results to date have been encouraging  we are not able to determine when  if ever  epratuzumab will be approved for sale in the united states or anywhere else 
even if it is approved  there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful or that we will ever receive revenues equal to our financial investment in this product candidate 
we have been evaluating immu y emab in a phase i ii clinical trial being conducted in the united states and europe 
this clinical trial is examining the safety and efficacy of immu in patients with indolent or aggressive non hodgkin s lymphoma who have had a relapse of disease following standard chemotherapy 
we are encouraged by the results of these trials and we are in the process of expanding these studies 
other therapeutic product candidates we also have in development a solid tumor therapeutic product candidate that targets an antigen known as carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea 
the cea antigen is abundant at the site of virtually all cancers of the colon and rectum and is associated with many other solid tumors  such as breast and lung cancers 
our humanized cea antibody hcea  immu is in clinical testing both in unlabeled and radiolabeled forms 
the unlabeled form is being tested in a phase i dose escalation trial in patients with colorectal or breast cancer 
a phase ii trial has been completed in europe for immu hcea i in patients with proven or suspected metastatic colorectal cancer who failed chemotherapy 
we believe that the initial results with immu are encouraging 
this phase i ii trial with immu hcea y has completed enrollment in the united states and in europe in patients with advanced colorectal and pancreatic cancers 
we have recently begun the clinical evaluation of immu  a new humanized antibody labeled with y  for the treatment of primary liver cancer 
immu binds to an antigen known as alpha fetoprotein afp  which is commonly produced by primary liver tumors 
we also are commencing clinical trials with immu anti cd for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases and non hodgkin s lymphoma  and we have received approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to begin clinical trials with immu for use in targeting anti muc antibody for pancreatic cancer therapy 
in addition to these three product candidates  we have several others in pre clinical development 
diagnostics in  we began to transition our focus away from the development of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates 
as a result  as of june   research and development into diagnostic imaging product candidates was no longer a material portion of our business 
ibc pharmaceuticals  inc in  we began conducting research involving the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to fight cancer as part of a collaboration with beckman coulter  inc beckman coulter 
upon our formation of the joint venture  ibc pharmaceuticals  llc  ibc llc  we granted certain intellectual property to the venture  as did beckman coulter 
we were then reimbursed for all of the research activities we conducted on the joint venture s behalf 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we were able to acquire all of the membership interests in ibc llc held by beckman coulter  giving us majority control of the business 
ibc llc was then reorganized into ibc pharmaceuticals  inc  a delaware corporation ibc 
we currently hold all of the outstanding shares of ibc series a preferred stock  representing approximately of the total shares of voting stock outstanding 
as a result of our majority interest in ibc  operating results of ibc are consolidated with the company 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts  estimated product returns and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
foreign currency risks since immunomedics operates in countries outside of the united states  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts immunomedics executes with its customers  since from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular immunomedics subsidiary s local currency 
these risks are generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by the company s foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net revenues and resultant earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon the company s consolidated financial results 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers and affiliates under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  immunomedics recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in immunomedics receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by immunomedics as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  for intercompany transactions for which settlement is planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  the related foreign currency transaction gains or losses  as applicable  are reported in other expenses income in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
finally  the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to the company s consolidated financial position 
stock based compensation immunomedics grants stock options to its employees at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and accounts for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the income statement 
however  for purposes of disclosure only  we estimate the fair value of stock options through the use of option pricing models 
in determining the values to use in our option pricing model  we make several subjective estimates about the characteristics of the underlying stock and the expected timing of option exercise 
changes to these estimates can change the fair value disclosures in our financial statements 
impairment of assets immunomedics reviews its long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon the company s judgment of its ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of  or  primarily due to a decrease in license fees 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year decreased to  from  for the same period in  primarily due to the complete recognition of the licensing fees associated with the development and license agreement with amgen  inc amgen agreement by february revenues derived from the amgen agreement declined from  in to  in product sales for fiscal year were about the same as as a result of the company s decision to transition its focus from the sale of diagnostic imaging products to the development of therapeutic compounds 
revenues from grants for research and development for fiscal year increased to  from  for the same period of total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  primarily due to an increased number of professional staff  as well as increased research and development efforts including manufacturing expenses such as laboratory supplies associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year increased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to increased sales of in vitro diagnostic kits and other imaging products and establishment of reserves for inventory on hand for product lines that are being de emphasized 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  general and administrative costs for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  interest and other income for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  in  primarily due to lower rates of return on our invested cash and reduced level of cash available for investment 
interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this increase was due to the  bond financing with the new jersey economic authority  completed in may  and the issuance of  of convertible senior notes  which was completed in january for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
these tax benefits were partially offset by income tax provisions of  and  primarily from our european subsidiary for and  respectively 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of  or 
product sales for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decrease of  principally reflecting our transition in focus from the sale of diagnostic imaging products to the development of therapeutic compounds

partially offset by recognition in of  as compared to  in fiscal of license and supply payments received from amgen 
revenues from grants for research and development for fiscal year decreased to  from  for the same period of total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  primarily due to an increased number of professional staff  as well as increased research and development efforts  manufacturing expenses including laboratory supplies associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials and costs associated with ibc in the amount of  as ibc became a majority owned subsidiary of immunomedics in june cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to decreased sales of in vitro diagnostic kits and other imaging products 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  this is primarily due to lower staffing levels in the united states and europe and the reduction of other marketing related expenses consistent with our shift in focus to therapeutics 
general and administrative costs for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  this was primarily due to the recognition of compensation expense of  associated with the issuance of a fully vested option to acquire  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share to dr 
morton coleman  a non employee director  in consideration for consulting services to immunomedics  as well as an increased number of employees and associated salary expenses  increased insurance costs  increased regulatory compliance costs for all public companies and other administrative expenses 
interest and other income for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  in  primarily due to lower rates of return on our invested cash and reduced level of cash available for investment 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
the tax benefit is partially offset by an income tax provision of  for our european subsidiary 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our equity securities  revenue earned under licensing agreements and  to a lesser degree  from sales of cea scan r and leukoscan r  research grants from various sources and investment income 
at june   we had working capital of  representing a decrease of  from  at june  at june   we had long term debt of  through the new jersey economic development authority and  aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes for a total of  the net decrease in working capital resulted principally from the net loss allocable to common stockholders during fiscal year of  partially offset by the  proceeds received from the january sale of convertible senior notes 
on january   we completed a  financing of convertible senior notes  which are due january  the notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of to be paid semiannually 
the holder of the notes may convert the notes at any time prior to the maturity date into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
immunomedics has registered the notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes with the sec for potential sale 
proceeds from the financing have been and will be used to continue the company s development of its cancer and autoimmune disease therapeutics and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in august  the company sold  shares of its common stock  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
the shares were sold to institutional investors at a price of per share 
the company also agreed to grant these investors rights to purchase an additional  shares of its common stock at a price of per share  by a date no later than november  the shares of common stock were sold pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities amounted to  at june   representing a decrease of  from  at june  this decrease was primarily attributable to the funding of operating expenses 
it is anticipated that working capital and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will decrease during fiscal year as a result of planned operating expenses and capital expenditures  offset by the additional cash proceeds received from the sale of common stock in august and by projected revenues from sales of our diagnostic imaging products in the united states and europe 
however  there can be no assurance as to the amount of revenues  if any  these imaging products will provide 
to date  we have not generated positive cash flow from operations  excluding the effects of the up front payment received from amgen in fiscal year we believe that based on the rate of our current and anticipated cash outlay  our existing working capital and the funds received in connection with our august sale of common stock should be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item  factors that may affect our business and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources when necessary to fund our strategic priorities 
we expect to utilize our cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our operations at levels similar to those used in fiscal year however  we do not believe that we will have adequate cash at this spending level to complete our research and development programs 
as a result  we will require additional financial resources after we utilize our current liquid assets in order for us to continue our research and development programs  clinical trials of our product candidates and regulatory filings 
additional financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable  if at all  and the terms of such financing may cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research and development programs 
if we obtain funds through collaborative partnerships  we may be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates 
we continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
contractual commitments our major contractual obligations relate to an operating lease for our facility  a loan from the new jersey economic development authority used to fund the expansion of our facility and the issuance of convertible senior notes 
we have identified and quantified the significant commitments in the following table for the fiscal years ending june payments due by period in thousands contractual obligation thereafter total operating lease   njeda loan      convertible senior notes   total       in november  we renewed our operating lease for our morris plains  new jersey facility for an additional term of years expiring in october at a base annual rate of  which included an additional  square feet 
the rent is fixed for the first five years and increases every five years thereafter 
in may  we obtained a loan for  at a variable interest rate through the new jersey economic development authority  repayable monthly in equal installments 
in january  we completed a  financing through the issuance of convertible senior notes due january  the notes bear interest at a fixed annual rate of  to be paid semiannually 
the holders of the notes may convert the notes at any time prior to january  at a conversion price of per share 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which addresses how an issuer classifies and measures financial instruments within characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuers 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the interim period beginning after june  for financial instruments created before the issuance date of sfas and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption  transition shall be achieved by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle by initially measuring the financial instruments at fair value or other measurement attribute required by sfas the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements

fin addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities  for which they do not have controlling interests through voting or other rights  if they are determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of variable economic interests 
fin provides guidance for determining the primary beneficiary for entities with multiple economic interests 
fin is effective at the time of investment for interests obtained in a variable economic entity after january  beginning in the third quarter of our fiscal year  fin applies to interests in variable interest entities vies acquired prior to february  the adoption of fin did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those described due to a number of factors  including uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and conditions impacting our industry 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised primarily of corporate debt securities and municipal bonds 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings also are exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in highly liquid debt instruments with fixed interest rates 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for our investment portfolio in marketable and restricted securities as of june  fair total value in thousands fixed rate      average interest rate
