item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview countrywide s core business is residential mortgage banking 
in recent years  we have expanded from our core mortgage banking business into related businesses 
we have pursued this diversification to capitalize on meaningful opportunities to leverage our core mortgage banking business and to provide sources of earnings that are less cyclical than the mortgage banking business 
we manage these businesses through five business segments mortgage banking  capital markets  banking  insurance and global operations 
the mortgage banking business continues to be the primary source of our revenues and earnings 
as a result  the primary influence on our operating results is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans in the us  which is affected by such external factors as prevailing mortgage rates and the strength of the us housing market 
in  total us residential mortgage production reached a record level of trillion  attributable in large part to historically low interest rates 
driven by this mortgage market  our mortgage banking operations achieved record earnings  as increased profits from loan production  enhanced by a significant increase in market share  more than offset losses attributable to the decline in value of our mortgage servicing rights 
our related businesses also benefited from low interest rates and the record level of mortgage production in as a result  our net earnings reached billion in  an increase of billion  or  from for  forecasters predict a to reduction in total us mortgage production  due to an expected decline in mortgage refinance activity 
we believe that a market within the forecasted range would still be favorable for our loan production business  although we would expect increased competitive pressures to have some impact on the profitability of that business 
a reduction in mortgage refinance activity should result  however  in an increase in profitability from our investment in mortgage servicing rights 
a decline in mortgage production would likely result in a reduction in mortgage securities trading and underwriting volume  which may negatively impact the profitability of our capital markets segment 
however  we expect earnings in our banking segment to increase  primarily as a result of growth in its mortgage loan portfolio 
the principal market risk we face is interest rate risk the risk that the value of our assets or liabilities or our net interest income will change due to changes in interest rates 
we manage this risk primarily through the natural counterbalance of our loan production operations and our investment in mortgage servicing rights  as well as through the use of various financial instruments including derivatives 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
we also face credit risk  primarily related to our residential mortgage production activities 
credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or an institution to honor its contractual obligations to us 
we manage mortgage credit risk principally by securitizing substantially all mortgage loans that we produce  and by only retaining high credit quality mortgages in our loan portfolio 
our liquidity and financing requirements are significant 
we meet these requirements in a variety of ways including use of the public corporate debt and equity markets  mortgage and asset backed securities markets  and increasingly in the future through the financing activities of our bank 
the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure that adequate  diverse and reliable sources of cash are available to meet our funding needs on a cost effective basis 
our ability to raise financing at the level and cost required to compete effectively is dependent on maintaining our high credit standing 
the mortgage industry has undergone rapid consolidation in recent years  and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
today the industry is dominated by large  sophisticated financial institutions 
to compete effectively in the future  we will be required to maintain a high level of operational  technological and managerial expertise  as well as an ability to attract capital at a competitive cost 
we believe that we will benefit from this consolidation through increased market share and rational price competition 

table of contents countrywide is a diversified financial services company  with mortgage banking at its core 
our goal is to be the leader in the mortgage banking business in the future 
we plan to leverage our position in mortgage banking to grow our related businesses 
as used in this report  references to we  our  the company or countrywide refer to countrywide financial corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies with the greatest impact on our financial condition and results of operations  and which require the most judgment  pertain to our mortgage securitization activities  our investments in msrs and other retained interests  and to our use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
our critical accounting policies involve the following four areas accounting for gains on sales of loans and securities  accounting for msrs and other retained interests  valuation of msrs and other retained interests  and  accounting for derivatives and our related interest rate risk management activities 
gain on sale of loans and securities substantially all of the mortgage loans we produce are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of securities 
when we sell loans in the secondary mortgage market we generally retain the msrs 
depending on the type of securitization  there may be other interests we retain including interest only securities  principal only securities and residual securities  which we generally hold as available for sale securities 
we determine the gain on sale of a security  or loans  by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between securities  or loans  sold and the interests retained  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale we report is the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale and the cost allocated to the securities  or loans  sold 
here is an example of how this accounting concept works carrying value of mortgage loans underlying a security fair values security retained interests total fair value computation of gain on sale of security sales proceeds less allocated cost  x  gain on sale initial recorded value of retained interests   the carrying value of mortgage loans includes the outstanding principal balance of the loans net of deferred origination costs and fees and any premiums or discounts 
accounting for msrs and other retained interests once msrs and other retained interests have been recorded  they must be periodically evaluated for impairment 
impairment occurs when the current fair value of the msrs or other retained interests falls below its carrying value 
if msrs are impaired  the impairment is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a valuation allowance 
if the value of the msrs subsequently increases  the 
table of contents recovery in value is recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the msrs is adjusted through a reduction in the valuation allowance 
as of december   the msr impairment valuation allowance was billion 
if impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  the valuation allowance is applied to reduce the cost basis of the msrs 
msrs cannot be carried above their amortized cost basis 
for other retained interests  which we account for as available for sale securities  impairment is recognized as a reduction to shareholders equity net of tax 
if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  it is recognized in current period earnings 
once we record this impairment  we recognize subsequent increases in the value of other retained interests in earnings over the estimated remaining life of the investment through a higher effective yield 
in addition to periodic evaluation for impairment  msrs are also subject to periodic amortization 
we compute msr amortization by applying the ratio of the net msr cash flows projected for the current period to the estimated total remaining net msr cash flows 
the estimated total net msr cash flows are determined at the beginning of each reporting period  using prepayment assumptions applicable at that time 
valuation of msrs and other retained interests considerable judgment is required to determine the fair values of our retained interests 
unlike government securities and other highly liquid investments  the precise market value of retained interests cannot be readily determined  because these assets are not actively traded in stand alone markets 
our msr valuation process combines the use of a sophisticated discounted cash flow model  extensive analysis of current market data  and senior financial management oversight to arrive at an estimate of fair value at each balance sheet date 
the cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model are based on our own empirical data drawn from the historical performance of our msrs  which we believe are consistent with assumptions used by market participants valuing msrs 
the most critical assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and the discount rate projected libor plus option adjusted spread 
these variables can and generally will change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change 
we determine the fairness of our msr valuation quarterly by comparison to the following market data as available msr trades  msr broker valuations  prices of interest only securities  and  peer group msr valuation surveys 
for the other retained interests  we also estimate fair value through the use of discounted cash flow models 
the key assumptions used in the valuation of our other retained interests include mortgage prepayment speeds  discount rates  and for residual interests containing credit risk  the net lifetime credit losses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk management section of this document for further discussion of credit risk 
we have incorporated cash flow and prepayment assumptions based on our own empirical data drawn from the historical performance of the loans underlying our other residual interests  which we believe are consistent with assumptions other major market participants would use in determining the assets fair value

this information is furnished to provide the reader with a basis for assessing the sensitivity of the values presented to changes in key assumptions 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in individual assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated 
in addition  in the above table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
derivatives and interest rate risk management activities we use derivatives extensively in connection with our interest rate risk management activities 
we record all derivative instruments at fair value 
we may qualify some of our interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting 
to qualify for hedge accounting we must demonstrate  on an ongoing basis  that our interest rate risk management activity is highly effective 
we use standard statistical measures to determine the effectiveness of our hedging activity 
if we are unable to qualify certain interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting  then the change in fair value of the associated derivative financial instruments would be reflected in current period earnings  while the change in fair value of the related asset or liability might not  thus creating a possible earnings mismatch 
this issue is potentially most significant regarding msrs  which absent the application of hedge accounting  are required to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or market 
in connection with our mortgage loan origination activities  we issue interest rate lock commitments irlcs to loan applicants and financial intermediaries 
the irlcs guarantee a loan s terms  subject to credit approval  for a period of time while the loan application is in process  typically between and days 
irlcs are derivative instruments and  therefore  are required to be recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value reflected in current period earnings 
however  unlike most other derivative instruments  there is no active market for irlcs that can be used to determine an irlc s fair value 
consequently  we have developed a method for estimating the fair value of our irlcs 
we estimate the fair value of an irlc based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan  given the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is based on quoted mbs prices 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the lock date 
therefore  at the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an irlc is zero 
subsequent to issuance  the value of an irlc can be either positive or negative  
table of contents depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan 
the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc is driven by a number of factors in particular  the change  if any  in mortgage rates subsequent to the lock date 
in general  the probability of funding increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicant s committed rate 
the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the irlc also is influenced by the source of the applications  age of the applications  purpose for the loans purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed closing ratio estimates using historical empirical data that take into account all of these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
these closing ratio estimates are used to estimate the number of loans that we expect to fund within the terms of the irlcs 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
application of accounting principles to loan commitments sab no 
 which summarizes the views of the sec staff regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments 
our current method used to estimate the fair value of irlcs is consistent with sab no 
 therefore  sab no

comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december  consolidated earnings performance our diluted earnings per share for totaled  a increase over diluted earnings per share for net earnings were  million  a increase from this earnings performance was driven by an increase in our mortgage loan production from billion in to billion in in addition  our non mortgage banking businesses achieved a substantial overall increase in earnings in industry wide  mortgage loan production reached a new record level of trillion in  up from trillion during source inside mortgage finance 
approximately two thirds of the mortgages produced in were refinances of existing mortgages that were triggered by historically low mortgage rates 
these same low rates contributed to increased activity in the us housing market  which also reached record levels in 
table of contents the continued high demand for mortgages drove not only high production volumes for countrywide  but also high production margins 
the combination of high volumes and margins yielded loan production sector pre tax earnings of  million for  an increase of  million from the high levels of mortgage refinances and home purchases resulted in significant prepayments within our mortgage loan servicing portfolio during the period 
this  along with the expectation of continued higher than normal prepayments in the future due to low mortgage rates  resulted in significant amortization and impairment of our msrs and other retained interests in the combined amount of amortization and impairment of msrs and other retained interests  net of servicing hedge gains  was  million  resulting in a pre tax loss of  million in the loan servicing sector for  compared to a pre tax loss of  million in these factors combined to produce pre tax earnings of  million in the mortgage banking segment for  an increase of  million  or  from our non mortgage banking businesses had combined pre tax earnings of million in  an increase of over benefiting again from a favorable market environment  our capital markets segment achieved pre tax earnings of million  up from million in in addition  our banking segment increased its pre tax earnings by million over the prior year  driven primarily by growth in its portfolio of mortgage loans

table of contents mortgage loan production by segment and product is summarized below years ended december  dollar amounts in millions segment mortgage banking capital markets conduit acquisitions treasury bank product prime prime home equity subprime mortgage banking segment our mortgage banking segment includes the loan production  loan servicing and loan closing sectors 
the loan production and loan closing services sectors generally perform at their best when mortgage rates are relatively low and loan origination volume is high 
conversely  the loan servicing sector generally performs well when mortgage rates are relatively high and loan prepayments are low 
the natural counterbalance of these sectors reduces the impact of changes in mortgage rates on our earnings 
during  historically low mortgage rates drove record levels of mortgage originations and prepayments industry wide  which contributed to record profits in the loan production and loan closing services sectors and near record losses in the loan servicing sector 
loan production sector the loan production sector produces mortgage loans through the three production divisions of countrywide home loans chl consumer markets  wholesale lending and correspondent lending  as well as through full spectrum lending  inc the pre tax earnings of the loan production sector are summarized below years ended december  percent of percent of loan loan production production dollars volume dollars volume dollar amounts in thousands revenues expenses operating expenses allocated corporate expenses total expenses pre tax earnings strong demand for residential mortgages enabled the loan production sector to achieve significant growth in revenues and earnings in compared to this performance was enhanced by a significant increase in our market share during the year 
our mortgage origination market share was in  up from in source inside mortgage finance 
ongoing favorable market conditions contributed to 
table of contents the continued high revenues earned  while high productivity levels helped keep unit costs low 
these factors combined to produce continued high profit margins pre tax earnings as a percentage of loan volume for the loan production sector 
the following table shows total mortgage banking loan production volume by division years ended december  dollar amounts in millions correspondent lending division consumer markets division wholesale lending division full spectrum lending  inc mortgage banking loan production for increased in comparison to all divisions  in particular correspondent lending  contributed to the increase in origination volume 
the increase was due primarily to a rise in non purchase loan production of 
an increase in purchase production of also contributed to the higher origination volume 
the increase in purchase loans is significant because this is the relatively stable growth component of the mortgage market  with average annual growth of over the last years 
the non purchase  or refinance  component of the mortgage market is highly volatile because it is driven almost exclusively by prevailing mortgage rates 
the following table summarizes mortgage banking loan production by purpose and interest rate type years ended december  dollar amounts in millions purpose purchase non purchase interest rate type fixed rate adjustable rate in  of our loan production was fixed rate  which reflects homeowner preferences for fixed rate mortgages in a low mortgage rate environment 
management expects that a higher percentage of homeowners would potentially choose adjustable rate mortgages in a higher interest rate environment 
such a shift in homeowner preferences may favor portfolio lenders  which have a natural preference for adjustable rate mortgages  over mortgage bankers that rely more heavily on securitization 

table of contents as shown in the following table  the volume of mortgage banking prime home equity and subprime mortgage loans produced which is included in the total volume of loans produced increased during the current period from the prior period years ended december  dollar amounts in millions prime home equity loans subprime mortgage loans percent of total loan production prime home equity and subprime mortgage loans carry higher profit margins historically  and the demand for such loans is believed to be less rate sensitive than the demand for prime home loans 
consequently  management believes these loans will be a significant component of the sector s future growth  in particular if mortgage rates should rise significantly 
a major source of intrinsic value derived from our msrs is countrywide s ability to retain its customers when they either refinance their loans or purchase new homes 
we successfully retained a significant percentage of the customers who prepaid their mortgages during our overall retention rate for was as compared to for our retention rate increased for purchase customers and remained constant for refinance customers 
our retention rate for purchase customers was for as compared to for our retention rate for refinance customers was for and during  the loan production sector operated at approximately of planned operational capacity 
the primary capacity constraint in our loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel we have on staff 
therefore  we measure planned capacity with reference to the number of loan operations personnel we have multiplied by the number of loans we expect each available loan operations staff person to process under normal conditions 
as volume decreased toward the end of  we began to make reductions in operations staff 
from its peak  the total number of operations personnel has been reduced by approximately  as loan production volume continues to moderate  the operations staff will be further reduced accordingly 
at the same time  a reduction in productivity to more sustainable levels will likely result in higher overall unit costs 
we plan to continue building our sales staff despite any potential drop in loan origination volume as a primary way to increase market share 
the following table summarizes the loan production sector workforce workforce at december  december  sales operations regular employees temporary staff production technology administration and support the consumer markets division continued to grow its commissioned sales force during the period 
at december   its commissioned sales force numbered  an increase of  during the year 
the primary focus of the commissioned sales force is to increase overall purchase market share 
the commissioned 
table of contents sales force contributed billion in purchase originations in  a increase over the purchase production generated by the commissioned sales force represented of the consumer markets division s purchase production for like the consumer markets division  the wholesale lending division and fsli continued to grow their sales forces as a core strategy to increase market share 
at december   the sales force in the wholesale lending division numbered  an increase of during the year 
fsli expanded its sales force by  or  during loan servicing sector the loan servicing sector reflects the performance of the company s investments in msrs and other retained interests and associated risk management activities  as well as profits from subservicing activities in the united states 
the loan servicing sector includes a significant processing operation  consisting of approximately six thousand employees who service the company s million mortgage customers 
how effectively this servicing operation manages costs and generates ancillary income from the portfolio has a significant impact on the long term performance of this sector 
the following table summarizes the results for the loan servicing sector years ended december  percentage of percentage of average servicing average servicing amount portfolio amount portfolio dollar amounts in thousands revenues servicing hedge gains amortization impairment operating expenses allocated corporate expenses interest expense  net pre tax loss average servicing portfolio the loan servicing sector experienced continued losses during the recent period  driven by high amortization and impairment of the company s retained interests 
the amortization and impairment charges reflect the loss in value of the company s retained interests  which was primarily due to the high level of actual and projected prepayments in the company s mortgage servicing portfolio 
in general  the value of the retained interests is closely linked to the estimated life of the underlying loans 
as prepayments increase  the estimated life of the underlying loans decreases 
the combined impairment and amortization charge was  million and  million during and  respectively 
during  the servicing hedge generated a gain of million 
this gain resulted from a decline in long term treasury and swap rates during the first part of  these indices underlie the derivatives and securities that constitute the primary component of the servicing hedge 
the servicing hedge gains generated in the early part of were partly offset by servicing hedge losses toward the end of the year as long term treasury and swap rates rose 
amortization and impairment  net of the servicing hedge  was  million for  an increase of million over in a stable interest rate environment  management would expect no significant impairment and would expect to incur expenses related to the servicing hedge driven primarily by the composition of the hedge  the shape of the yield curve and the level of interest rate volatility 

table of contents during  we securitized a portion of our net servicing fees excess servicing 
proceeds from the sale of such securities amounted to  million 
securities not sold were classified as trading securities and included in investments in other financial instruments at december  we believe such securitizations enable us to more efficiently manage our capital 
despite the high level of prepayments  we increased our servicing portfolio to billion at december   a increase from december  at the same time  the overall weighted average note rate of loans serviced for others declined from to 
loan closing services sector this sector is comprised of the landsafe companies  which provide credit reports  flood determinations  appraisals  property valuation services and title reports primarily to the loan production sector but increasingly to third parties as well 
our integration of these previously outsourced services has provided not only incremental profits but also higher overall levels of service and quality control 
the landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings  representing an increase of from the year ago period 
the increase in landsafe s pre tax earnings was primarily due to the increase in our loan origination activity 
non mortgage banking businesses to leverage our mortgage banking platform  as well as to reduce the variability of earnings due to changes in mortgage interest rates  we have expanded into other financial services 
these other businesses are grouped into the following segments capital markets  banking  insurance and global operations

margins on prime mortgage loans were high in both periods on a relative historical basis  due largely to the very favorable mortgage market environment that prevailed during those periods 
during  we sold a small portion of prime home equity loans produced 
we plan to hold the remaining prime home equity loans as investments in the form of available for sale securities or loans 

table of contents re performing loans are reinstated loans that had previously defaulted  and were consequently re purchased from mortgage securities we issued 
the increase in gain on sale of re performing loans is due to an increase in the volume of loans sold 
the note rate on these loans is typically higher than the current mortgage rate  and therefore  the margin on these loans is typically higher than margins on prime mortgage loans 
capital markets revenues from its trading activities consist of gains on the sale of securities and net interest income 
in a very steep yield curve environment  which existed during both periods  trading revenues will derive largely or entirely from net interest income earned during the securities holding period 
as the yield curve flattens  the mix of revenues will shift toward gain on sale of securities 
the increase in capital markets gain on sale of loans related to its conduit activities was due to increased acquisitions and sales during in comparison to in general  gain on sale of loans and securities is affected by numerous factors  including the volume and mix of loans sold  production channel mix  the level of price competition  the slope of the yield curve and the effectiveness of our associated interest rate risk management activities

this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average net spread earned from in to in the decrease in the average net spread is the result of a flatter yield curve 
the increase in net interest income from the banking segment was primarily attributable to year over year earning asset growth in both the bank and cwl

comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  to the ten months ended december  consolidated earnings performance our diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  totaled  a increase over diluted earnings per share for the ten months ended december  net earnings increased from the ten months ended december  this earnings performance was driven mainly by the increased level of residential mortgage loans we produced billion during the year ended december  in comparison to billion for the ten months ended december  in addition  the year ended december  is compared to a transition period consisting of ten months 
industry wide  residential mortgage originations were approximately trillion during calendar  up from approximately trillion in calendar source inside mortgage finance 
approximately of the residential mortgages produced in calendar were refinances of existing mortgages triggered by historically low mortgage rates 
the balance of mortgages produced related to home purchases 
the record demand for residential mortgages not only drove record loan production volumes for countrywide  but also high loan production margins 
the combination of record volumes and high margins increased our loan production sector pre tax earnings to billion for the year ended december   an increase of  or billion from the ten months ended december  the high levels of mortgage refinances and home purchases in the year ended december  resulted in significant prepayments within our mortgage loan servicing portfolio during the year 
this  along with the expectation of continued higher than normal prepayments due to historically low mortgage rates  resulted in significant amortization and impairment of the company s msrs and other retained interests in the year ended december  the combined amount of amortization and impairment of msrs and other retained interests  net of servicing hedge gains  was billion 
this resulted in a pre tax loss of billion in the loan servicing sector in the year ended december   billion more than the pre tax loss in the ten months ended december  overall  the mortgage banking segment generated pre tax earnings of million for the year ended december   an increase of over the ten months ended december  our non mortgage banking businesses also were significant contributors to countrywide s record earnings performance in the year ended december  in particular  our capital markets segment had pre tax earnings of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the ten months ended december  capital markets has grown its core franchise significantly over the last five years and is now among the leading investment banking firms in its niche  the mortgage securities market

our mortgage origination market share was in calendar  up from in calendar source inside mortgage finance 
favorable market conditions allowed us to increase revenues earned on prime home loans  while high productivity levels during the year ended december  helped keep unit costs low 
these factors combined to produce record profit margins pre tax earnings as a percentage of loan volume for the loan production sector 
the following table shows total loan volume by division mortgage banking loan production year ended ten months ended december  december  dollar amounts in millions correspondent lending division wholesale lending division consumer markets division full spectrum lending  inc our mortgage banking loan production for the year ended december  increased in comparison to the ten months ended december  the increase was due to a rise in both purchase and non purchase loan production of and  respectively 
the increase in purchase money loans is significant because this is the relatively stable growth component of the mortgage market  with average annual growth of over the last years 
the non purchase  or refinance  component of the mortgage market is highly volatile because it is driven almost exclusively by prevailing mortgage rates 
all divisions  in particular correspondent lending  contributed to the increase in origination volume 
the correspondent lending division has benefited most from the consolidation trend in our industry 
in calendar  the top five correspondent lenders combined had a share of the correspondent origination market  up from in 
table of contents the following table summarizes loan production by purpose and interest rate type mortgage banking loan production year ended ten months ended december  december  dollar amounts in millions purpose purchase non purchase interest rate type fixed rate adjustable rate as shown in the following table  the volume of prime home equity and subprime mortgage loans produced which is included in the total volume of loans we produced increased during the year ended december  as compared to the ten months ended december  mortgage banking prime home equity and subprime mortgage production year ended ten months ended december  december  dollar amounts in millions prime home equity loans subprime percent of total loan production prime home equity and subprime mortgage loans carry higher profit margins historically and the demand for such loans is believed to be less rate sensitive than the demand for prime home loans 
consequently  management believes these loans will be a significant component of the sector s future growth  in particular if mortgage rates should rise significantly 
during the year ended december   the loan production sector operated at approximately of planned operational capacity 
the primary capacity constraint in our loan origination activities is the number of loan operations personnel we have on staff 
therefore  we measure planned capacity by multiplying the number of loan operations personnel we have by the number of loans we expect each available loan operations staff person to process under normal conditions 
in the year ended december   we continued to increase the number of sales and operations staff in our loan production divisions to capitalize on the current market environment 
in recent years  our consumer markets division has commenced a fundamental restructuring of its business model primarily by building a best in class sales organization 
this organization consists of a dedicated commissioned sales force and the attendant management  systems and operations support 
in addition  the consumer markets division has begun to centralize some of its processing operations to create more flexible processing capacity to support its expanded sales organization  as well as its growing portfolio retention effort 
at december  the commissioned sales force external home loan consultants numbered  an increase of  during the year 
the primary focus of the external home loan consultants is to increase overall purchase market share 
external home loan consultants contributed billion in purchase originations in the year ended december   a increase over the ten months ended december  the purchase production generated by the external home loan consultants represented of the consumer market division s purchase production for the year ended december

like the consumer markets division  the wholesale lending division has focused on improving its sales efforts 
the division has created specialized sales units that cater to individual segments of the wholesale market eg  large regional and national brokers 
in addition  the wholesale lending division continued to make improvements in its business partner website cwbc 
com  which was used by its business partners in of the loans produced by the division in the year ended december  to improve efficiency and quality control  the division centralized processing of its subprime loans in the year ended december  during the year ended december   the correspondent lending division added significant capacity by adding temporary staff  moving to multiple shifts  implementing accelerated training classes and increasing the use of electronic data interfaces with customers 
this strategy allowed the division to quickly adjust to changes in the origination market 
loan servicing sector our loan servicing sector reflects the performance of the company s investments in msrs and other retained interests and associated risk management activities  as well as profits from subservicing activities in the united states 
the loan servicing sector incorporates a significant processing operation  consisting of approximately five thousand employees who service the company s million mortgage customers 
how effectively this servicing operation manages costs and generates ancillary income from the portfolio has a significant impact on the long term performance of this sector

the company s msrs and other retained interests represent the present value of cash flow streams that are closely linked to the expected life of the underlying servicing portfolio 
the continued high level of actual and forecasted prepayment activity reduced the life of the servicing portfolio and thus the value of our msrs and other retained interests  as reflected by the combined impairment and amortization charge of billion incurred in the year ended december  the servicing hedge generated a gain of billion during the year ended december   which partially offset the combined impairment and amortization charge 
amortization and impairment  net of the

during the year ended december   we securitized a portion of our net servicing fees excess servicing 
proceeds from the sale of these securities amounted to million 
management believes such securitizations enable us to more efficiently manage our capital 
despite the level of prepayments  we increased our servicing portfolio to billion at december   representing a increase compared to december  loan closing services sector our landsafe companies produced million in pre tax earnings in the year ended december   representing a increase over the ten months ended december  the increase in landsafe s contribution to pre tax earnings was primarily due to our increased loan production

the increase in net earned premiums resulted from a increase in the number of policies in force driven by growth in our loan servicing portfolio  coupled with an overall increase in the ceded premium percentage 
our life and casualty insurance operations produced a pre tax earnings of million  a decrease in earnings of million  or  compared to the ten months ended december  although the prior period included only ten months  the additional two months of earnings in the year ended december  was more than offset by lower investment portfolio income and higher than expected claims costs related to 
table of contents certain homeowners reinsurance contracts that were later terminated 
additional insurance claim expenses also were recorded related to certain other lender placed insurance contracts due to observed losses higher than expectations 
these lender placed insurance contracts were later favorably renegotiated 
these amounts were partially offset by a million  or  increase in premiums earned during the year ended december  compared to the ten months ended december  balboa life and casualty s overall loss ratio was and in the year ended december  and in the ten months ended december   respectively 
balboa manages its insurance risk by reinsuring portions of its insured risk 
balboa seeks to earn profits by capitalizing on countrywide s customer base and institutional relationships  as well as through operating efficiencies and sound underwriting 
balboa reinsurance historically has not realized insurance losses  owing to a generally strong economy  an even stronger housing market and the age of the underlying insured loans 
during the year  we revised our reinsurance contracts  to provide additional coverage in exchange for additional ceded premiums 
management expects balboa reinsurance to incur insurance losses in the future as the underlying insured loans continue to age 
global operations segment for the year ended december   our global operations segment s pre tax earnings totaled million  representing an increase of million in comparison to the ten months ended december  results in the current period were positively affected by the recognition of higher technology licensing fees related to ghl s increased processing volumes for both originations and servicing

table of contents gain on sale of loans and securities increased in the year ended december  primarily due to higher production and sales volume and higher margins on prime mortgage loans 
margins on subprime mortgage loans and prime home equity loans declined primarily due to a change in production channel mix 
wld and cld produced a larger percentage of these mortgages  these two divisions traditionally have lower margins than our retail channels 
margins on prime mortgage loans were high in both periods on a relative historical basis  due largely to the very favorable mortgage market environment that prevailed during those periods 
the market was characterized by record consumer demand for mortgages and modest price competition by historical industry standards 
management expects margins  particularly on prime home loans  to decline in the future as the level of mortgage originations subsides 
the reduction in capital markets gain on sale of securities was largely due to the impact of the steepening yield curve on the mix of its revenues 
capital markets revenues from its trading activities consist of gains on the sale of securities and net interest income 
in a very steep yield curve environment  trading revenues will derive largely or entirely from net interest income earned during the securities holding period 
as the yield curve flattens  the mix of revenues will shift toward gain on sale of securities 
in general  gain on sale of loans and securities is affected by numerous factors including the volume and mix of loans sold  production channel mix  the level of price competition and the slope of the yield curve

the increase in the average net spread was also attributable to the relative decline in short term financing rates 
the increase in interest expense in the loan servicing sector is due primarily to a full year of interest expense in the current period compared to ten months of interest expense in the prior period 

table of contents re performing fha and va loans are reinstated loans that had previously defaulted and were consequently re purchased from mortgage securities issued by countrywide or others 
such loans are subsequently securitized and re sold 
the increase in interest income related to this activity results from an increase in the volume of such loans purchased during the year ended december  the increase in net interest income from the banking segment was largely attributable to year over year asset growth both in treasury bank and in our warehouse lending activities and in an increase in the average net spread from in the ten months ended december  to in the year ended december  average assets in the banking segment increased to billion in the year ended december   an increase of billion in comparison to the ten months ended december  net interest income from custodial balances decreased due to a decline in the earnings rate  which is tied to short term rates  from in the ten months ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease in the earnings rate was partially offset by a billion  or  increase in the average custodial balances during the year ended december  compared to the ten months ended december   resulting from a larger portfolio and higher loan payoffs 
custodial balances rise as loan payoffs increase because we hold the payoff funds for periods ranging from to calendar days  depending on the payoff date and the investor servicing agreement 
net interest income from custodial balances decreased also as a result of the general requirement of loan servicers to pass through interest on paid off loans at the underlying security rates  which were significantly higher than the short term rates we earned 
this reduced net interest income from custodial balances by million and million in the year ended december  and the ten months ended december   respectively

this increase was partially offset by a small reduction in the overall annualized net service fee earned from of the average portfolio balance during for the ten months ended december  to during the year ended december  the reduction in the overall net service fee was largely due to the securitization of excess service fees during the year ended december  the increase in income from other retained interests was due to a full year of earnings in the year ended december  compared to ten months of earnings in  combined with a increase in investment balances during the year ended december  and an increase in the yield of these investments from in the ten months ended december  to in the year ended december  these investments include interest only and principal only securities as well as residual interests that arise from the

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk 
the most predominate type of interest rate risk at countrywide is price risk  which is the risk that the value of our assets or liabilities will change due to changes in interest rates 
to a lesser extent  interest rate risk also includes the risk that the net interest income from our mortgage loan and investment portfolios will change in response to changes in interest rates 
from an enterprise perspective  we manage this risk through the natural counterbalance of our loan production and servicing businesses 
we also use various financial instruments  including derivatives  to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to our committed pipeline  mortgage loan inventory and mbs held for sale  msrs  trading securities and other retained interests as well as a portion of our debt 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
our corporate asset liability management committee alco  which is comprised of several of the company s senior financial executives  maintains oversight of this risk 

table of contents committed pipeline and mortgage inventory we are exposed to price risk such from the time an interest rate lock commitment irlc is made to a mortgage applicant or financial intermediary to the time the related mortgage loan is sold 
during this period  we are exposed to losses if mortgage rates rise  because the value of the irlc or mortgage declines 
to manage this price risk  we use derivatives  primarily forward sales of mbs and options to buy and sell mbs  as well as options on treasury futures contracts 
the committed pipeline consists of loan applications in process where we have issued irlcs to the applicants or financial intermediaries 
irlcs guarantee the rate and points on the underlying mortgage for a specified period  generally from seven to sixty days 
managing the price risk related to the committed pipeline is complicated by the fact that the ultimate percentage of applications that close within the terms of the irlc is variable 
the primary factor that drives the variability of the closing percentage is changes in mortgage rates 
in general  the percentage of applications in the committed pipeline that ultimately close within the terms of the irlc increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicants committed rates 
the closing percentage is also influenced by the source of the applications  age of the applications  purpose for the loans purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed closing ratio estimates for the committed pipeline using empirical data taking into account all of these variables 
our closing ratio estimates also take into account renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
our closing ratio estimates are revised periodically using the most current empirical data 
to manage the price risk associated with the committed pipeline  we use a combination of net forward sales of mbs and put and call options on mbs or treasury futures 
as a general rule  we enter into forward sales of mbs in an amount equal to the portion of the committed pipeline expected to close  assuming no change in mortgage rates 
we acquire put and call options to protect against the variability of loan closings caused by changes in mortgage rates  using our current closing ratio estimates to determine the amount of optional coverage required 
we manage the price risk related to our mortgage loan inventory primarily by entering into forward sales of mbs 
the value of these forward sales moves in opposite direction to the value of the mortgage loan inventory 
we review our committed pipeline and mortgage inventory risk profiles on a daily basis 
we use the following derivative instruments in our risk management activities related to the committed pipeline and mortgage loan inventory forward sales of mbs represents an obligation to sell a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
forward purchases of mbs represents an obligation to buy a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
long call options on mbs represents a right to buy a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
long put options on mbs represents a right to sell a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
long call options on treasury futures represents a right to acquire a treasury futures contract at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate falls 
long put options on treasury futures represents a right to sell a treasury futures contract at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate rises 
short eurodollar futures contracts represents a standardized exchange traded contract  the value of which is tied to spot eurodollar rates at specified future dates  therefore  its value increases when eurodollar rates rise 

table of contents mortgage servicing rights msrs and other retained interests our msrs and other retained interests  specifically interest only securities and residual securities  are generally subject to loss in value when mortgage rates decline 
declining mortgage rates generally precipitate increased consumer refinancing activity 
increased refinancing activity reduces the life of the loans underlying the msrs and other retained interests  thereby reducing their value 
reductions in the value of these assets impact earnings through impairment charges 
to moderate the effect on earnings of impairment  we maintain a portfolio of financial instruments  including derivatives  which increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline the servicing hedge 
we currently use the following financial instruments in our servicing hedge interest rate floors represents a right to receive cash if a reference interest rate falls below a contractual strike rate  therefore  its value increases as reference interest rates fall 
the reference interest rates used in the company s interest rate floors include mortgage rates  treasury rates and us dollar usd libor 
us treasury securities consists of notes and bonds with maturities ranging generally from ten to thirty years 
as interest rates decrease  the values of these securities generally increase 
long treasury futures represent the agreement to purchase a treasury security at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury rate falls 
long call options on treasury and eurodollar futures represents a right to acquire a treasury or eurodollar futures contract at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury or eurodollar deposit rate falls 
long put options on treasury and eurodollar futures represents a right to sell a treasury or eurodollar futures contract at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as the benchmark treasury or eurodollar deposit rate rises 
long call options on mbs represents a right to buy an mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
forward purchases of mbs represents an obligation to buy a mbs at a specific price in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
interest rate swaps represents a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate eg  usd libor 
for use in the servicing hedge  we receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate  therefore  the contract increases in value as rates fall 
receiver swaptions represents a right to enter into a predetermined interest rate swap at a future date in which  upon exercise of its right  we receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate  therefore  the contract increases in value as rates fall 
payor swaptions represents a right to enter into a predetermined interest rate swap at a future date in which  upon exercise of its right  we pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate  therefore  the contract increases in value as rates rise 
principal only securities consist of mortgage trust principal only securities and treasury principal only securities strips 
these securities have been purchased at discounts to their par value 
as interest rates decrease  the values of these securities generally increase 
these instruments are used in tandem to manage the overall risk profile of the msrs and other retained interests 
we review our retained interests risk profile on a daily basis 

table of contents trading activities in connection with our capital markets activities  we maintain a trading portfolio of fixed income securities  primarily mbs 
we are exposed to price changes in our trading portfolio arising from interest rate changes during the period we hold the securities 
to manage this risk  we use the following derivative instruments forward sales of to be announced tba mbs represents an obligation to sell agency pass through mbs that have not yet been issued at a specific price and at a specific date in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates rise 
forward purchases of tba mbs represents an obligation to purchase agency pass through mbs that have not yet been issued at a specific price at a specific date in the future  therefore  its value increases as mortgage rates fall 
forward sale of us treasury securities represents a standardized exchange traded agreement to sell a specific quantity of us treasury securities for a specific price at a specific date in the future  therefore  its value increases when interest rates rise 
short fed funds and eurodollar futures contracts represents a standardized exchange traded contract  the value of which is tied to spot fed funds or eurodollar rates at specified future dates 
the value of these contracts increases when fed funds or eurodollar rates rise 
interest rate swaps represents a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments with one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate eg usd libor 
for use in our trading portfolio risk management activities  we generally receive the floating rate and pay the fixed rate  therefore  its value generally increases in value as rates rise 
treasury bank the primary component of treasury bank s earnings is net interest income derived from its mortgage loan and investment portfolios 
at treasury bank  we invest primarily in adjustable rate and short duration residential mortgages 
our securities portfolio is comprised mostly of short duration sequential collateralized mortgage obligations 
we manage our interest rate risk primarily by investing in relatively simple  short duration assets  and matching the duration and re pricing characteristics of our liabilities with those of our assets 
deposits are priced to encourage consumers to choose maturity terms consistent with our assets 
in addition  the structure and terms of our borrowings are chosen to manage our interest rate risk 
debt securities we determine the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt as part of our overall interest rate risk management activities 
we use interest rate swaps to efficiently and cost effectively achieve our desired mix of debt 
typically  terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt  resulting in an effective conversion of the debt rate 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments we perform various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
these analyses incorporate assumed changes in the interest rate environment including selected hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
various modeling techniques are employed to value the financial instruments in connection with these sensitivity analyses 
for mortgage loans  mbs  mbs forward contracts  collateralized mortgage obligations and msrs  an option adjusted spread oas model is used 
the primary assumptions used in this model for purpose of these sensitivity analyses are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds 
for options and interest rate floors  an option pricing model is used 
the primary assumption used in 
table of contents this model is implied market volatility of interest rates 
other retained interests are valued using zero volatility discounted cash flow models incorporating all relevant cash flows associated with these instruments 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates  discount rates and credit losses 
utilizing these modeling techniques  the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments as of december   given several hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve change in fair value change in interest rate basis points dollar amounts in millions msrs and other financial instruments msr and other retained interests impact of servicing hedge swap based treasury based msrs and other retained interests  net committed pipeline mortgage loan inventory impact of associated derivative instruments mortgage based treasury based committed pipeline and mortgage loan inventory  net treasury bank securities portfolio mortgage loans deposit liabilities federal home loan bank advances notes payable and capital securities impact of associated derivative instruments swap based notes payable and capital securities  net prime home equity line of credit senior securities other mortgage loans held for investment insurance company investment portfolios net change in fair value related to msrs and other financial instruments net change in fair value related to broker dealer trading securities 
table of contents the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments as of december   given several hypothetical instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve change in fair value change in interest rate basis points dollar amounts in millions net change in fair value related to msrs and other financial instruments net change in fair value related to broker dealer trading securities during  we reduced our reliance on derivatives to manage the interest rate risk related to our msrs 
we took this action in light of the incremental profits we expected to generate from our loan production operations if mortgage rates continued to decline 
this strategy had the benefit of reducing our potential derivative losses in the event mortgage rates increased  which did occur in the last half of these sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time  are subject to the accuracy of various assumptions used  including prepayment forecasts and discount rates  and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the company s overall financial performance in such scenarios  most significantly the impact of changes in loan production earnings that occur over time 
in addition  not all of the changes in fair value would impact current period earnings 
for example  msrs are carried at the lower of cost or market  therefore  absent hedge accounting  the increase in the value of the msrs that is recorded in current period earnings would be limited to recovery of the impairment reserve billion at december  
debt is carried at cost  therefore  absent hedge accounting  changes in the value of debt are not recorded in current period earnings 
for these reasons  the preceding estimates should not be viewed as an earnings forecast 
foreign currency risk we occasionally issue medium term notes denominated in a foreign currency 
we manage the foreign currency risk associated with these medium term notes through currency swap transactions 
the terms of the currency swaps effectively translate the medium term notes into us dollar obligations  thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency 
as a result  potential changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such medium term notes would not have a net financial impact on future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
credit risk management credit risk is the potential for financial loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or an institution to honor its contractual obligations to us 
credit risk arises in many of our business activities including lending activities  trading activities and interest rate risk management activities 
we actively manage credit risk to maintain credit losses within levels that achieve our profitability and return on capital objectives while meeting our expectations for consistent financial performance 
our credit committee  which is comprised of our chief credit officer and other senior executives  has primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve the credit risk goals and objectives set by our board of directors 
those goals and objectives are documented in our credit policy 
mortgage credit risk overview in our mortgage lending activities  we manage our credit risk by producing high quality loans  employing proactive collection and loss mitigation efforts and selling the majority of the loans we produce on a non recourse basis 

table of contents loan quality our credit policy establishes standards for the determination of acceptable credit risks 
those standards encompass borrower and collateral quality  underwriting guidelines  and loan origination standards and procedures 
borrower quality includes consideration of the borrower s credit and capacity to pay 
we assess credit and capacity to pay through the use of credit scores  application of a mortgage scorecard  and manual or automated underwriting of additional credit characteristics 
collateral quality includes consideration of property value  condition  and marketability and is determined through physical inspections and the use of manual and automated valuation models 
underwriting guidelines facilitate the uniform application of underwriting standards to all borrowers regardless of race  religion  or ethnic background 
uniformity in underwriting also provides a means for measuring and managing credit risk 
this allows us  as well as government sponsored entities gses  private investors  and the secondary markets in general  to assess risk  which provides us with more flexibility in the sale of loans 
our conventional conforming and government underwriting guidelines comply with the guidelines established by fannie mae or freddie mac 
our underwriting guidelines for fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans comply with guidelines established by the us department of housing and urban development and the veterans administration 
our underwriting guidelines for non conforming mortgage loans  prime home equity loans  and subprime mortgage loans have been designed so that these loans are salable in the secondary mortgage market 
we developed these guidelines to meet the requirements of private investors  rating agencies and third party credit enhancement providers 
our loan origination standards and procedures are designed to produce high quality loans 
these standards and procedures encompass underwriter qualifications and authority levels  appraisal review requirements  fraud prevention  funds disbursement controls  training of our employees and on going review of their work 
we help to ensure that our origination standards are met by employing accomplished and seasoned management  underwriters  and processors and through the extensive use of technology 
we also have a comprehensive training program for the continuing development of both our existing staff and new hires 
in addition  we employ proprietary underwriting systems in our loan origination process that improve the consistency of underwriting standards  assess collateral adequacy  and help to prevent fraud  while at the same time increasing productivity 
in addition to our pre funding controls and procedures  we employ an extensive post funding quality control process 
our quality control department  under the direction of the chief credit officer  is responsible for completing comprehensive loan audits that consist of a re verification of loan documentation  an in depth underwriting and appraisal review  and if necessary  a fraud investigation 
we also employ a post funding proprietary loan performance evaluation system 
this system identifies fraud and poor performance of individuals and business entities associated with the origination of our loans 
the combination of this system and our audit results allows us to evaluate and measure adherence to prescribed underwriting guidelines and compliance to laws and regulations to ensure that current loan production represents acceptable credit risk  as defined by the board of directors 
sale of loans nearly all of the mortgage loans that we originate are sold into the secondary mortgage market primarily in the form of securities  and to a lesser extent as whole loans 
while we generally sell our prime mortgage loans on a non recourse basis  either in the form of securities or whole loans  we do have potential liability under the representations and warranties we make to purchasers and insurers of the loans 
in the event of a breach of such representations and warranties  we may be required to either repurchase the subject mortgage loans or indemnify the investor or insurer 
in such cases  any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans is borne by countrywide 

table of contents securitization as described below  the degree to which credit risk on the underlying loans is transferred through the securitization process depends on the structure of the securitization 
our prime first mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while prime home equity and subprime mortgage loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
conforming conventional loans conforming conventional loans are generally pooled into mortgage backed securities guaranteed by fannie mae 
a small portion of these loans also have been sold to freddie mac or the federal home loan bank  through its mortgage partnership finance program 
subject to certain representations and warranties on the part of countrywide  nearly all conventional loans securitized through fannie mae or freddie mac are sold on a non recourse basis 
accordingly  credit losses are generally absorbed by fannie mae and freddie mac  not countrywide 
we pay guarantee fees to fannie mae and freddie mac on loans we securitize through these agencies 
these fees include compensation to the respective agencies for their assumption of credit risk 
fha insured and va guaranteed loans fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans are generally pooled into mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
a small portion of these loans have been sold to the federal home loan bank  through its mortgage partnership finance program 
we are insured against foreclosure loss by the fha or partially guaranteed against foreclosure loss by the va 
fees charged by the fha and va for assuming such risks are paid directly by the mortgagors 
we are exposed to credit losses on defaulted va loans to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the va is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred 
we pay guarantee fees to ginnie mae for ginnie mae s guarantee on its securities of timely payment of principal and interest 
ginnie mae does not assume mortgage credit risk associated with the loans securitized under its program 
non conforming conventional prime loans non conforming conventional prime mortgage loans are generally pooled into private label non agency mortgage backed securities 
such securitizations involve some form of credit enhancement  such as senior subordinated structures or mortgage pool insurance 
securitizations that involve senior subordinated structures contain securities that assume varying levels of credit risk 
holders of subordinated securities are compensated for the credit risk assumed through a higher yield 
we generally sell the subordinated securities created in connection with these securitizations and thereby transfer the related credit loss exposure  other than as described above with respect to representations and warranties made when loans are securitized 
prime home equity loans prime home equity loans are generally pooled into private label asset backed securities 
these securities generally are credit enhanced through over collateralization and guarantees provided by a third party surety 
in such securitizations  countrywide is subject to limited recourse for credit losses through retention of a residual interest 
subprime mortgage loans subprime mortgage loans generally are pooled into private label mortgage backed securities 
we generally securitize these loans with limited recourse for credit losses 
such limited recourse securitizations generally have contained mortgage pool insurance as the primary form of credit enhancement  coupled with a limited corporate guarantee provided by countrywide and or a retained residual interest 
when mortgage pool insurance is used  the associated premiums are paid directly by countrywide 
we also have pooled a portion of our subprime loans into securities guaranteed by fannie mae 
in such cases  we have paid fannie mae a guarantee fee in exchange for fannie mae assuming the credit risk of the underlying loans 
in addition  we 
table of contents have securitized a portion of our subprime mortgage loans on a limited recourse basis through the retention of a residual interest without the use of mortgage pool insurance 
our exposure to credit losses related to our limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
these amounts at december  are as follows december  dollar amounts in thousands subordinated interests prime home equity residual securities prime home equity transferors interests subprime residual securities corporate guarantees in excess of recorded reserves the carrying value of the residual securities is net of expected future credit losses 
related to our non recourse and limited recourse securitization activities  the total credit losses incurred for and are summarized as follows years ended december  dollar amounts in thousands subprime securitizations with corporate guarantee subprime securitizations with retained residual interest repurchased or indemnified loans prime home equity securitizations with retained residual interest prime home equity securitizations with corporate guarantee va losses in excess of va guarantee mortgage reinsurance we provide mortgage reinsurance through contracts with several primary mortgage insurance companies on mortgage loans included in our servicing portfolio 
under these contracts  we absorb mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of loans  subject to a cap  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premium 
approximately billion of mortgage loans in our servicing portfolio are covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance contracts place limits on our maximum exposure to losses 
at december   the maximum aggregate losses under the reinsurance contracts were million 
we are required to pledge securities to cover this potential liability 
we recorded provisions for losses related to this activity of million in mortgage loans held for sale at december   mortgage loans held for sale amounted to billion 
while the loans are in inventory  we bear credit risk after taking into consideration primary mortgage insurance which is generally required for conventional loans with a loan to value ratio greater than  fha insurance or va guarantees 
historically  credit losses related to loans held for sale have not been significant 

table of contents portfolio lending activities we have a growing portfolio of prime mortgage and prime home equity loans held for investment  primarily in our bank  which amounted to billion at december  a portion of the prime home equity loans held in the bank are covered by a pool insurance policy that provides partial protection against credit losses 
otherwise  we generally retain full credit exposure on these loans 
our allowance for credit losses related to all mortgage loans held for investment amounted to million at december  we also provide short term secured mortgage loan warehouse advances to various lending institutions  which totaled billion at december  we incurred no credit losses related to this activity in counterparty credit risk we have exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by our trading counterparties and counterparties to our various over the counter derivative financial instruments 
we manage this credit risk by selecting only well established  financially strong counterparties  spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties and by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit risk from any single counterparty 
the aggregate amount of counterparty credit exposure at december   before and after collateral held by countrywide  was as follows dollar amounts in millions aggregate credit exposure before collateral held less collateral held net aggregate unsecured credit exposure for the year ended december   the company incurred no credit losses due to non performance of any of its counterparties 
loan servicing the following table sets forth certain information regarding our servicing portfolio of single family mortgage loans  including loans and securities held for sale or investment and loans subserviced for others  for the periods indicated 
years ended december  dollar amounts in millions summary of changes in the servicing portfolio beginning owned servicing portfolio add loan production purchased msrs less servicing sold runoff ending owned servicing portfolio subservicing portfolio total servicing portfolio

expressed as a percentage of the total number of loans serviced excluding subserviced loans and loans purchased at a discount due to their non performing status 
we attribute the overall decline in delinquencies in our servicing portfolio primarily to the relative overall increase in the conventional and prime home equity portfolios  which carry lower delinquency rates than the government and subprime portfolios 
management believes the delinquency rates in our servicing portfolio are consistent with industry experience for similar mortgage loan portfolios 
inflation an increase in inflation would have the most significant impact on our mortgage banking and capital markets operations 
interest rates normally increase during periods of rising inflation 
historically  as interest rates increase  mortgage loan production decreases  particularly from loan refinancing 
an environment of gradual interest rate increases may  however  signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values  which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity 
generally  in such periods of reduced mortgage loan production the associated profit margins also decline due to increased competition among mortgage loan originators and to higher unit costs  thus further reducing our loan production earnings 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  our loan servicing earnings generally increase because mortgage prepayment rates tend to slow down  thereby extending the average life of our servicing portfolio and thus reducing the 
table of contents amortization and impairment of our msrs 
within our broker dealer operations  rising interest rates generally lead to a reduction in trading and underwriting activities in its primary niche  the mortgage securities market 
seasonality the mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends 
these seasonal trends reflect the pattern in the national housing market 
home sales typically rise during the spring and summer seasons and decline during the fall and winter seasons 
seasonality has less of an effect on mortgage refinancing activity  which is primarily driven by prevailing mortgage rates 
in addition  mortgage delinquency rates typically rise temporarily in the winter months  driven by mortgagor payment patterns 
liquidity and capital resources we have significant short term and long term financing needs 
our short term financing needs arise primarily from the warehousing of mortgage loans pending sale and the trading activities of our broker dealer 
our long term financing needs arise primarily from our investments in msrs and other retained interests  along with the financial instruments acquired to manage the interest rate risk associated with those investments  as well as from the continued growth of our mortgage loan investment portfolio 
as discussed in the following paragraphs  we meet our financing needs in a variety of ways  through the public corporate debt and equity markets  as well as the mortgage and asset backed securities markets  and increasingly in the future through the deposit gathering and other financing activities of our bank 
liquidity management the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure that adequate reliable sources of cash are available to meet our potential near term funding needs  including in times of stress within the financial markets 
we manage our liquidity by financing our assets in a manner consistent with their liquidity profile 
assets that are considered illiquid are financed with long term capital equity and debt with a final maturity greater than six months 
we stagger our long term debt maturities and credit facility expirations to reduce refinancing risk 
we also manage the timing of our short term debt maturities to limit the amount maturing in any five day period 
we diversify our financing programs  credit providers and debt investors and dealers to reduce reliance upon any one source of liquidity 
finally  we assess all sources of financing based upon its reliability  recognizing that certain financing programs are sensitive to temporary market disruptions 
we regularly forecast our potential funding needs over a three month horizon  taking into account debt maturities and potential peak balance sheet levels 
available reliable sources of liquidity are appropriately sized to meet potential future funding requirements 
we currently have billion in reliable sources of short term liquidity  including secured and unsecured committed bank lines of credit and reusable mortgage purchase commitments totaling billion 
our long term debt typically consists of unsecured debt issued in the public corporate debt markets 
at december   we had billion in unsecured long term debt outstanding 
see note notes payable in the financial statement section of this report for additional descriptions of our committed financing programs 
public corporate debt markets the public corporate debt markets are a key source of financing for us  due to their efficiency and low cost 
typically  we access these markets by issuing unsecured commercial paper and medium term notes 
we also have issued unsecured subordinated debt  convertible debt and trust preferred securities 
at december   we had a total of billion in public corporate debt outstanding 
to maintain our desired level of access to the public corporate debt markets  it is critical for us to maintain investment grade credit ratings 
we have consistently maintained solid investment grade credit ratings over the past twelve years 
given our current ratings  we generally have deep access to the public 
table of contents corporate debt markets 
current credit ratings at chl  our primary issuer of public corporate debt  are as follows short term long term ratings ratings standard and poors a a moody s investors service p a fitch f a among other things  maintenance of our current investment grade ratings requires that we have high levels of liquidity  including access to alternative sources of funding such as committed bank stand by lines of credit  as well as a conservative capital structure 
our policy is to maintain our regulatory capital ratios at levels that are above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal reserve board 
at december  and at december   cfc s regulatory capital ratios were as follows december  december  minimum required ratio amount ratio amount dollar amounts in thousands tier leverage capital risk based capital tier total minimum required to qualify as well capitalized 
our primary source of equity capital is retained earnings 
we also have billion outstanding in trust preferred securities that receive varying degrees of equity treatment from rating agencies  bank lenders and regulators 
in addition  we currently have a billion deferred tax liability related to our msrs that would offset a portion of any potential loss in the value of our msrs and which  to that extent  can be viewed as a supplement to our equity capital 
from time to time  we engage in stock offerings as a means of increasing our capital base and supporting our growth 
issues of concern to one or more credit rating agency in the past have included our significant investment in msrs and other retained interests  our involvement in subprime lending  as well as our liquidity and capital structure 
we maintain an active dialogue with all three rating agencies  meeting throughout the year to review operational and financial performance and to address specific areas of focus 
in the unlikely event our credit ratings were to drop below investment grade  our access to the public corporate debt markets would be severely limited 
the cutoff for investment grade is generally considered to be a long term rating of bbb  or three gradations below our lowest current rating 
in the event of a ratings downgrade below investment grade  we would be required to rely upon alternative sources of financing  such as bank lines and private debt placements secured and unsecured 
furthermore  we would likely be unable to retain all of our existing bank credit commitments beyond the then existing maturity dates 
as a consequence  our cost of financing would rise significantly and we may have to curtail some of our capital intensive activities  such as our ongoing investment in msrs and other retained interests 
on the other hand  given the highly liquid nature of our mortgage inventory and broker dealer trading portfolio  we would likely be able to arrange secured financing for such assets 
over the long term  however  it would be difficult for us to compete effectively without investment grade ratings 
management believes the likelihood of a reduction in our credit ratings to below investment grade in the foreseeable future is remote 
asset backed financing market a growing source of funding for us is the asset backed financing market 
this form of financing generally involves the temporary transfer of legal ownership of assets to a separate legal entity conduit in exchange for short term financing 
such financing programs generally have commercial bank sponsors that provide some 
table of contents form of credit enhancement to the program  for example  back up lines of credit 
investors that purchase debt  typically commercial paper  issued by these conduits look primarily to the assets to ensure repayment  rather than to the credit standing of the companies that utilize the conduit for financing 
we have used this market primarily to finance a significant portion of our mortgage loan inventory 
due to its liquid nature and short holding period  our mortgage loan inventory is a natural fit for this type of financing program 
we utilize such programs as a cost effective means to expand and diversify our sources of liquidity 
at december   we had a borrowed a total of billion through such asset backed financing programs 
secondary mortgage market we rely substantially on the secondary mortgage market 
nearly all mortgage loans that we produce are sold in the secondary mortgage market  primarily in the form of mortgage backed securities mbs and asset backed securities 
the majority of the mbs we sell are guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae collectively  agency mbs 
we also issue non agency or private label mbs and asset backed securities 
private label mbs and asset backed securities are registered with the sec and have separate credit ratings 
generally  private label mbs and asset backed securities require some form of credit enhancement  such as over collateralization  senior sub structures  primary mortgage insurance  countrywide guarantees and or private surety guarantees 
the agency mbs market is extremely liquid 
the private label mbs market  particularly the subprime mbs market  is significantly less liquid  although we have enjoyed essentially uninterrupted access to these markets  albeit at varying costs 
we ensure our ongoing access to the secondary mortgage market by consistently producing quality mortgages and servicing those mortgages at levels that meet or exceed secondary mortgage market standards 
as described elsewhere in this document  we have a major focus on ensuring the quality of our mortgage loan production and we make significant investments in personnel and technology in this regard 
repurchase agreements we also utilize short term repurchase agreements as a means of financing primarily securities as well as mortgage loans pending sale 
although this method of financing is uncommitted and short term in nature  it has proven to be reliable and cost effective for us 
bank activities our goal is to increase the total assets of our bank from billion as of december  to billion in five years 
we intend to accomplish this goal by using our loan origination operations to source loans for the bank to originate and place in its portfolio 
funding for this growth will come from a variety of sources  including transfers of custodial accounts controlled by chl  secured advances from the federal home loan bank and retail deposits  primarily cds  generated by the bank 
cash flow cash flow used by operating activities was billion for  compared to net cash used by operating activities of billion for the reduction in cash flow used by operations for compared to was due primarily to a billion net increase in mortgage loans held for sale offset by a decrease in other financial instruments 
net cash used in investing activities was billion for  compared to billion for the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a billion net increase in loans held for investment and a billion net increase in additions to msrs 
net cash provided by financing activities during totaled billion  compared to billion during the increase in cash provided by financing activities during was comprised of a billion net increase in bank deposit liabilities and a billion net increase in the growth of short term primarily secured borrowings

such transactions are structured to manage our interest rate credit or liquidity risks  diversify funding sources or to optimize our capital 
substantially all of our off balance sheet arrangements relate to the securitization of mortgage loans 
our mortgage loan securitizations are normally structured as sales  in accordance with sfas  which involves the transfer of the mortgage loans to qualifying special purpose entities that are not subject to consolidation 
in a securitization  an entity transferring the assets is able to convert those assets into cash 
special purpose entities used in such securitizations obtain cash to acquire the assets by issuing securities to investors 
in a securitization  we customarily provide representations and warranties with respect to the mortgage loans transferred 
in addition  we generally retain the right to service the transferred mortgage loans 
we also  generally have the right to repurchase mortgage loans from the special purpose entity if the remaining outstanding balance of the mortgage loans falls to a level where the cost of servicing the loans exceeds the revenues we earn 
our prime mortgage loans generally are securitized on a non recourse basis  while prime home equity and subprime mortgage loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit losses 
during  we securitized billion subprime and home equity loans with limited recourse for credit losses 
our exposure to credit losses related to our limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the recorded liability for such guarantees 
for a further discussion of our exposure to credit risk  see the section in this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk

table of contents prospective trends united states mortgage market over the last decade  total mortgage indebtedness in the united states has grown at an average annual rate of eight percent 
we believe that continued population growth  ongoing developments in the mortgage market and the prospect of relatively low interest rates support similar growth in the market for the foreseeable future 
some of the ongoing developments in the mortgage market that should fuel its growth include government sponsored programs targeted to increase homeownership in low income and minority communities  the growth of prime home equity lending as a major form of consumer finance  and the increasing efficiency of the secondary mortgage market that lowers the overall cost of homeownership 
in recent years  the level of complexity in the mortgage lending business has increased significantly due to several factors the continuing evolution of the secondary mortgage market has resulted in a proliferation of mortgage products  greater regulation imposed on the industry has resulted in increased costs and the need for higher levels of specialization  and interest rate volatility has risen over the last decade 
at the same time  homeowners propensity to refinance their mortgages has increased as the refinance process has become more efficient and cost effective 
the combined result has been large swings in the volume of mortgage loans originated from year to year 
these volume swings have placed significant operational and financial pressures on mortgage lenders 
to compete effectively in this environment mortgage lenders must have a very high level of operational  technological and managerial expertise 
in addition  the residential mortgage business has become more capital intensive and therefore access to capital at a competitive cost is critical 
primarily as a result of these factors  the industry has undergone rapid consolidation 
today  large  sophisticated financial institutions dominate the residential mortgage industry 
these industry leaders are primarily commercial banks operating through their mortgage banking subsidiaries 
today  the top thirty mortgage lenders combined have a share of the mortgage origination market  up from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of market share for the top five originators  according to inside mortgage finance years ended december  institution wells fargo home mortgage washington mutual countrywide chase home finance bank of america mortgage abn amro mortgage group total for top five comparative data not included for year in which the institution was not in the top five originators 
this consolidation trend has naturally carried over to the loan servicing side of the mortgage business 
today  the top thirty mortgage servicers combined have a share of the total mortgages outstanding  up 
table of contents from five years ago 
following is a year over year comparison of market share for the top five servicers  according to inside mortgage finance years ended december  institution washington mutual wells fargo home mortgage countrywide chase home finance bank of america mortgage total for top five we believe this consolidation trend will continue  as the aforementioned market forces will continue to drive out weak competitors 
we believe countrywide will benefit from this trend through increased market share 
in addition  we believe that irrational price competition which from time to time has plagued the industry should lessen in the future 
compared to countrywide  the other industry leaders are less reliant on the secondary mortgage market as an outlet for adjustable rate mortgages  due to their greater portfolio lending capacity 
this could place us at a competitive disadvantage in the future if the demand for adjustable rate mortgages increases significantly  the secondary mortgage market does not provide a competitive outlet for these loans and we are unable to develop a portfolio lending capacity similar to the competition s 
housing appreciation housing values affect us in several positive ways rising housing values point to healthy demand for purchase money mortgage financing  increased average loan balances  and a reduction in the risk of loss on sale of foreclosed real estate in the event a loan defaults 
however  as housing values appreciate  prepayments of existing mortgages tend to increase as mortgagors look to tap the additional equity in their homes 
over the last several years  the housing price index has significantly outpaced the consumer price index and growth in personal income 
consequently  we expect housing values to increase at a slower rate in the coming years than in the past several years 
over the long term  we expect that housing appreciation will be positively correlated with both consumer price inflation and growth in personal income 
regulatory trends the regulatory environments in which we operate have an impact on the activities in which we may engage  how the activities may be carried out and the profitability of those activities 
therefore  changes to laws  regulations or regulatory policies can affect whether and to what extent we are able to operate profitably 
for example  proposed state and federal legislation targeted at predatory lending could have the unintended consequence of raising the cost or otherwise reducing the availability of mortgage credit for those potential borrowers with less than prime quality credit histories 
this could result in a reduction of otherwise legitimate subprime lending opportunities 
similarly  certain proposed state and federal privacy legislation  if passed  could have an adverse impact on our ability to cross sell the non mortgage products our various divisions offer to customers in a cost effective manner 

table of contents mortgage originations following is the estimated total united states mortgage originations market for each of the last five years united states mortgage calendar year originations billions source inside mortgage finance forecasters currently put the market for at between trillion and trillion 
the forecasted reduction from s historic level is attributable to an expected decline in mortgage refinance activity 
we believe that a market within the forecasted range would still be favorable for our loan production business  although we would expect increased competitive pressures to have some impact on its profitability 
this forecast would imply lessening pressure on our loan servicing business due to a reduction in mortgage loan prepayment activity 
in our capital markets business  such a drop in mortgage originations would likely result in a reduction in mortgage securities trading and underwriting volume  which would have a negative impact on its profitability 
implementation of new accounting standards on march   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas statement no

we adopted eitf for the fiscal quarter ended august  and there was no material impact at adoption on our financial statements 
in september  sfas no 
accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  sfas was issued  which replaced sfas no 
of the same title 
sfas revises certain standards in the accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires some additional disclosures relating to securitization transactions and collateral  but it carries over most of sfas s provisions 
we included the collateral and disclosure 
table of contents provisions of sfas in our february  financial statements 
all other provisions of this statement were adopted on april   as required by the statement 
the adoption of this statement had no material impact on our financial statements 
during june  sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas were issued 
sfas requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   provides specific guidance on how to identify the accounting acquirer in a business combination  provides specific criteria for recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill  and requires additional financial statement disclosures regarding business combinations 
sfas will impact our accounting for any business combinations that we may enter into in the future 
however  sfas s adoption had no impact on our present financial condition or results of operations 
sfas addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after their initial recognition 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets by replacing periodic amortization of the asset with an annual test of impairment of goodwill at either the reporting segment level or one level below  providing for similar accounting treatment for intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life 
assets with finite lives will be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas also provides for additional financial statement disclosures about goodwill and intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas were applicable to us beginning in the year ending december  we have insignificant levels of goodwill and purchased related intangible assets and the adoption of sfas had no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in august  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas was issued 
sfas retains the existing requirements to recognize and measure the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of by sale 
however  sfas changes the scope and certain measurement requirements of existing accounting guidance 
sfas also changes the requirements relating to reporting the effects of a disposal or discontinuation of a segment of a business 
the adoption of sfas had no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

specifically  fin clarifies that entities are required to record guarantees at their fair values  including the value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event the specified triggering events or conditions occur  regardless of whether the occurrence of the triggering events or conditions is deemed probable of occurring 
fin is effective for new guarantees issued or modification of guarantees made after december  fin s disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin s measurement requirements did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin was amended in december fin requires business enterprises to consolidate variable interest entities which have one or more of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 

table of contents the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a 
the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights b 
the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur c 
the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
as discussed in note company obligated capital securities of subsidiary trusts  the company has issued trust preferred securities 
based on guidance related to fin  the company will cease consolidating the subsidiaries which have issued the trust preferred securities during the quarter ending march  the primary effect of this de consolidation will be for the company to re classify the trust preferred securities from mezzanine equity to debt 
interest payments relating to the trust preferred securities are presently charged to interest expense 
therefore  this change will have no effect on the company s results of operations 
fin excludes qualifying special purpose entities subject to the reporting requirements of sfas fin applies upon formation to variable interest entities created after january   and to all variable interest entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  at december   countrywide s corporate structure included either companies whose accounts were consolidated into the company s financial statements or which were classified as qualifying special purpose entities under sfas therefore  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on the company s financial statements at december  in april  the fasb issued statement no

on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp deferring the effective date of sfas for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests 
sfas would have required the reclassification of our trust preferred securities from mezzanine financing to liabilities 
however  the issuance of fsp delayed this reclassification pending reconsideration of the issue by the fasb 
the adoption of the remainder of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
forward looking statements factors that may affect our future results we make forward looking statements in this report and in other reports we file with the sec 
in addition  we make forward looking statements in press releases and our management might make forward looking statements orally to analysts  investors  the media and others

words like believe  expect  anticipate  promise  plan and other expressions or words of similar meanings  as well as future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could  or may are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations 
some of these factors are discussed below 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes that occur after the date they are made 
general business  economic and political conditions may significantly affect our earnings our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the united states 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  and the strength of the us economy  and the local economies in which we conduct business 
if any of these conditions worsen  our business and earnings could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household incomes could decrease the demand for our home loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans  or  a rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans 
in addition  our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
we are particularly affected by the policies of the federal reserve board  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
the federal reserve board s policies influence the size of the mortgage origination market  which significantly impacts the earnings of our loan production sector and the value of our investment in msrs and other retained interests 
the federal reserve board s policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and can have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
political conditions can also impact our earnings 
acts or threats of war or terrorism  as well as actions taken by the us or other governments in response to such acts or threats  could impact business and economic conditions in the united states 
if we cannot effectively manage the volatility of our mortgage banking business  our earnings could be affected the level and volatility of interest rates significantly affect the mortgage banking industry 
for example  a decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for home loans as borrowers refinance  but also generally leads to accelerated payoffs in our mortgage servicing portfolio  which negatively impacts the value of our msrs 
we attempt to manage interest rate risk in our mortgage banking business primarily through the natural counterbalance of our loan production and servicing operations 
in addition  we also use derivatives extensively in order to manage the interest rate  or price risk  inherent in our assets  liabilities  and loan commitments 
our main objective in managing interest rate risk is to moderate the impact of changes in interest rates on our earnings over time 
our interest rate risk management strategies may result in significant earnings volatility in the short term 
the success of our interest rate risk management strategy is largely dependent on our ability to predict the earnings sensitivity of our loan servicing and loan production operations in various interest rate environments 
the success of this strategy impacts our net income 
this impact  which can be either positive or negative  can be material 

table of contents our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations  and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
we have identified several accounting policies as being critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these critical accounting policies relate to our gain from sale of loans and securities  valuation of retained interests and interest rate management activities 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the estimates associated with these critical accounting policies  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make significant adjustments to the related amounts recorded at december  for more information  please refer to the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies section in this report 
the financial services industry is highly competitive we operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic  legislative  regulatory and technological changes 
competition for mortgage loans comes primarily from large commercial banks and savings institutions 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints 
for example  national banks and federal savings and loan institutions are not subject to certain state laws and regulations targeted at predatory lending practices and we could be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to fulfilling legitimate subprime credit opportunities 
another competitive consideration is that other companies have lower cost structures and others are less reliant on the secondary mortgage market for funding due to their greater portfolio lending capacity 
we face competition in such areas as mortgage product offerings  rates and fees  and customer service  both at the retail and institutional level 
in addition  technological advances and heightened e commerce activities have increased consumers accessibility to products and services generally 
this has intensified competition among banking as well as nonbanking companies in offering financial products and services  with or without the need for a physical presence 
changes in regulations could adversely affect our business we are heavily regulated by banking  mortgage lending and insurance laws at the federal  state and local levels  and proposals for further regulation of the financial services industry are continually being introduced 
we are subject to many other federal  state and local laws and regulations that affect our business  including those regarding taxation and privacy 
congress and state legislatures  as well as federal and state regulatory agencies  review such laws  regulations and policies and periodically propose changes that could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could  for example  limit the types of financial services and products we offer  or increase our cost to offer such services and products 
it is possible that one or more legislative proposals may be adopted or regulatory changes may be implemented that would have an adverse effect on our business 
our failure to comply with such laws or regulations  whether actual or alleged  could expose us to fines  penalties or potential litigation liabilities  including costs  settlements and judgments  any of which could adversely affect our earnings 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties  we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors 
for example  in deciding whether to extend credit to 
table of contents institutional customers  we may assume that a customer s audited financial statements conform with gaap and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the customer 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with gaap or are materially misleading 
other factors the above description of risk factors is not exhaustive 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include  but are not limited to a general decline in us housing prices or activity in the us housing market a loss of investment grade credit ratings  which may result in increased cost of debt or loss of access to corporate debt markets a reduction in the availability of secondary markets for our mortgage loan products a reduction in government support of homeownership a change in our relationship with the housing related government agencies and sponsored entities ineffectiveness of our hedging activities the level of competition in each of our business segments the occurrence of natural disasters or other events or circumstances that could impact the level of claims in the insurance segment other risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the sec 
other factors that may not be described in any such report or document that could also cause results to differ from our expectations 
each of these factors could by itself  or together with one or more other factors  adversely affect our business  results of operations and or financial condition
