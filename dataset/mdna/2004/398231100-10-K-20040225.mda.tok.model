item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the consolidated financial statements of griffin include the accounts of griffin s subsidiary in the landscape nursery business  imperial nurseries  inc imperial  and griffin s connecticut and massachusetts based real estate business griffin land 
griffin also has an equity investment in centaur communications  ltd 
centaur  a privately held magazine publishing business based in the united kingdom 
the notes to griffin s consolidated financial statements included in item contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of griffin s consolidated financial statements 
in the opinion of management  griffin does not have any individual accounting policy that is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
this is due principally to the definitive nature of the accounting requirements for the landscape nursery and real estate businesses in which griffin is engaged 
also  in many cases  griffin must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of griffin s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a review of the more significant accounting estimates used by griffin accounts receivable management estimates future recoverability of its accounts receivable based on an accounts aging  payment history and financial condition 
inventories in applying the principle of the lower of cost or market using the average cost method to nursery stock  management must estimate the future recoverability of certain plants within the inventory that have not matured as planned 
such estimates are based on the physical characteristics of the nursery stock in question and potential sales outlets 
deferred tax assets in applying sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  management estimates future taxable income from operations  the sale of appreciated assets and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that griffin will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
impairment of long lived assets griffin evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets in relation to their operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows 
summary griffin s results in fiscal reflect moderate improvement of the operating results of its landscape nursery and real estate businesses  offset by higher interest expense and lower results from its equity income in centaur 
the lower operating loss in the landscape nursery business reflects a lower charge for inventory disposals above normal amounts expected overall plant loss rates that are included in cost of goods sold  offset by lower gross profit due to weaker pricing 
griffin land s operations reflect an increase in operating profit due principally to the results of the two office buildings in which griffin land acquired the remaining from a joint venture at the beginning of the year 
griffin land previously held a interest in those properties 
the higher interest expense principally reflects the costs of borrowing funds to acquire the remaining interest in the two office buildings  finance construction of a new facility built on speculation by griffin land and operate the landscape nursery business 
the lower results at centaur reflect the net benefit of certain one time items included in fiscal a detailed discussion of fiscal results is included below 
effective for the earliest year reported in the accompanying financial statements  griffin restated its investment in centaur and its additional paid in capital as the result of an error by centaur pertaining to its fiscal year ended june  the effect of the restatement was to reduce griffin s investment in centaur and reduce griffin s additional paid in capital each by  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal griffin s consolidated net sales and other revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million reflects increases in net sales and other revenue of million at griffin land and million at imperial 
net sales and other revenue at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting an increase of million in revenue from griffin land s leasing operations partially offset by not having any land sales in fiscal as compared to revenue of million from land sales in fiscal the increase in revenue from leasing operations was due to a million from the two office buildings that griffin land acquired in the first quarter  b a million increase from new leases of existing space  net of revenue decreases from vacancies  c million from leasing space that was completed and leased mid year in fiscal but leased for the entire year in fiscal  and d million from increased billings to tenants for expense reimbursements 
revenue from the early termination of leases was million in both fiscal and fiscal at november   griffin land owned  square feet of office  flex and industrial space for lease  with  leased 
at november   griffin land had  square feet of office  flex and industrial space available for lease of which  square feet was leased 
the increase in the amount of total square feet in griffin land s portfolio reflects the completion in the fiscal fourth quarter of the shell of an  square foot industrial building that is ready for tenant work but not yet leased 
leasing in the industrial  flex and office markets where griffin land s properties are located was slower in fiscal as compared to the previous two years 
inquiries from prospective tenants have increased in the latter part of fiscal and the early part of fiscal as compared to earlier in fiscal  which management believes indicates that leasing activity may strengthen in the second half of fiscal net sales and other revenue at imperial increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in imperial s net sales principally reflects a increase in unit sales volume and the effect of selling  on average  larger sized material in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in sales of larger sized plants reflects changes in imperial s product mix made over the past several years 
these were offset by overall lower pricing  as product available from growers appeared to exceed demand 
management believes that net sales in fiscal and fiscal were hampered by unfavorable weather conditions  particularly during imperial s peak spring selling season in both years 
in fiscal  cold weather in march and early april  including snow in some areas  followed by excessive rain in the latter part of spring resulted in customers delaying and  in many cases  canceling orders 
these factors particularly affected imperial s garden center and wholesaler customer segments 
in fiscal  net sales were negatively affected by poor spring weather  which included drought conditions in the mid atlantic area and excessive rain and cold in the midwest 
imperial s spring net sales accounts for approximately of imperial s annual net sales 
griffin s consolidated operating loss decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the lower consolidated operating loss reflects an increase of million in operating profit at griffin land and a decrease of million in the operating loss at imperial  partially offset by an increase of million in griffin s general corporate expense 
operating profit at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the following amounts in millions fiscal fiscal profit from leasing activities before depreciation and amortization expense profit from property sales general and administrative expenses profit before depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense operating profit griffin land s profit before depreciation and interest from its leasing activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due principally to the increase of million in leasing revenue discussed above  partially offset by an increase of million in operating expenses of griffin land s buildings 
the higher operating expenses principally reflect million related to the two office buildings acquired in the first quarter  million from buildings that were online for the entire year in fiscal as compared to part of the year in fiscal and million of higher expenses throughout all buildings  due principally to higher snow removal costs  utility expenses and real estate taxes 
land sales generated a profit of million in fiscal  however there were no land sales in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense at griffin land increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due principally to depreciation on the two office buildings acquired in the fiscal first quarter and a full year s depreciation on buildings completed in fiscal  which included only a partial year s depreciation on those assets 
griffin land s general and administrative expenses  including real estate taxes on undeveloped land  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due principally to real estate tax increases 
imperial s operating loss decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the lower operating loss reflects an increase in imperial s gross profit from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher gross profit was due to a lower charge for unsaleable inventory in fiscal as compared to fiscal partially offset by the effect of lower pricing 
in fiscal  cost of goods sold included a million charge for inventory losses above normal amounts as compared to a million charge included in fiscal cost of goods sold 
the inventory charge in fiscal reflected failures in certain crops  poor results from the propagation of new plants at imperial s northern florida operation and failure to sell certain parts of the inventory which subsequently became unsaleable 
the significantly lower inventory charge in fiscal was due to improved operations at imperial s florida facility partially offset by the effect of certain disease issues at imperial s connecticut operations 
excluding the effect of the inventory charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  imperial s gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal imperial s gross margins on sales excluding the effect of the inventory charges decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the lower gross profit and lower margins reflect the effect of the weakened pricing in fiscal and higher fiscal freight costs that could not be passed on to customers  which more than offset the effect of the increase in unit sales volume 
the higher freight costs  due principally to shipments from imperial s northern florida facility  reflect the cost of ensuring that a sufficient quantity of common carrier trucks was available to imperial to meet the demand for deliveries during imperial s peak spring selling season 
management is continuing to seek new vendor relationships to ensure continued availability of trucks in sufficient quantity to meet expected demand and to reduce these costs in the future 
imperial s selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and fiscal  but as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal imperial s marketing expense included in selling  general and administrative expense increased by million in fiscal due principally to promotion of products sold under the new novalis trade name 
overall lower expenses in other areas  due in part to a headcount reduction and efforts to maintain expenses at prior year s level  offset the effect of the higher marketing expenses 
griffin s general corporate expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase principally reflects million due to higher compensation expenses and million of general expense increases 
griffin s consolidated interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase reflects the overall higher amount of borrowings outstanding in fiscal as compared to fiscal griffin s average amount of debt outstanding in fiscal was million as compared to average outstanding debt of million in fiscal the higher amount of outstanding debt in fiscal includes the million nonrecourse mortgage completed in the first quarter to finance the acquisition of the interest in two griffin center office buildings and other borrowings needed to supplement operating cash flow to finance griffin s working capital requirements and real estate development activities 
griffin s effective rate of its income tax benefit in fiscal was as compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of in fiscal griffin s effective rate of its income tax benefit in fiscal reflects a rate for a federal income tax benefit  adjusted for state income tax benefits 
griffin has net deferred tax assets of million that would be realized upon recognition of taxable income of approximately million 
based on projected future taxable income from operations  the sale of appreciated assets in the near future  tax planning strategies and the future periods in which net operating loss carryforwards may be utilized  management believes it is more likely than not that griffin will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets currently reported 
therefore  a valuation allowance is not included in griffin s results for fiscal the high effective income tax benefit rate in fiscal reflects the tax benefit on griffin s pretax loss and the release of a liability of million for income taxes as a result of a favorable outcome during fiscal of tax examinations for earlier years 
the tax examinations were made on tax returns filed by culbro corporation culbro  griffin s parent company prior to the distribution the distribution of griffin common stock to culbro s shareholders in under a tax sharing agreement  the liability for income taxes was assumed by griffin from culbro at the time of the distribution 
griffin s equity income from centaur decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the lower equity income in fiscal reflects several nonrecurring items included in centaur s results in fiscal results from griffin s equity investment in centaur would have been substantially unchanged had it not been for the following nonrecurring items 
these included the gain at centaur from the sale of its lawtel operation  of which griffin s equity share was million 
partially offsetting the gain on the sale of lawtel was a goodwill impairment charge at centaur  of which griffin s equity share was million 
griffin s equity income from centaur in fiscal also included the effect of centaur reversing a valuation allowance on certain of its deferred tax assets  of which griffin s equity share was million 
griffin s fiscal equity income includes the effect of a charge  of which griffin s equity share is million  for future costs of a lease for office space no longer being used 
griffin s equity income from centaur in fiscal also benefited from discontinuing the amortization of goodwill at the beginning of fiscal in accordance with griffin s adoption of sfas no 
see note to the financial statements included in item 
the effect of this accounting change was approximately million in fiscal the increase in net sales at centaur from fiscal to fiscal was substantially offset by higher costs and expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal griffin s consolidated net sales and other revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million reflects an increase in net sales and other revenue of million at imperial and an increase in net sales and other revenue of million at griffin land 
net sales and other revenue at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million in net sales and other revenue at griffin land reflects an increase of million of revenue from its leasing operations partially offset by a decrease of million on revenue from property sales 
the higher net sales and other revenue from griffin land s leasing operations was due to a an increase of million in rental revenue from two buildings that were built and partially leased in fiscal and leased for the entire year in fiscal  b a net increase of million in rental revenue from leasing space that was previously vacant  net of previously leased space that was vacated in the current year  and c an increase of million in rental revenue from the  square foot building in the new england tradeport that was completed in fiscal and leased for a portion of the year  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in other revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to million received in fiscal in connection with an agreement to terminate early a lease and million from construction management fees received in fiscal net sales and other revenue at imperial increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in net sales and other revenue at imperial of million reflects an increase in net sales of imperial s container grown plants of million in fiscal partially offset by the inclusion in fiscal of million of net sales from the sscs prior to their sale in january the increase in net sales of container grown plants reflects an increase in sales of larger sized plants  which have a higher per unit sales price  which more than offset a decline in unit sales volume in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in sales of larger sized plants reflects changes in imperial s product mix made over the past several years 
management believes that fiscal net sales were hampered by unfavorable weather conditions in imperial s markets during the spring  its peak selling season 
drought conditions in the mid atlantic area and excessive rain and cold in the midwest negatively affected sales in those areas 
griffin s consolidated operating loss decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal griffin s consolidated operating loss in fiscal included an operating loss of million from imperial s sscs prior to their sale in january excluding the operating loss from the sscs in fiscal  griffin s overall operating results were substantially unchanged in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating profit at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting the following amounts in millions fiscal fiscal profit from leasing activities before depreciation and amortization expense profit from property sales general and administrative expenses profit before depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense operating profit although profit from leasing remained unchanged  fiscal included the benefit of million from a lease termination 
excluding the early lease termination payment  profit from griffin land s commercial properties increased by million in fiscal due to an increase in the amount of space leased in fiscal as compared to fiscal at november   griffin land had  square feet of office  flex and industrial space available for lease including  square feet in the office building shell that was recently completed and is now ready for tenant work and the  square feet of office space in the two buildings owned by the joint venture in which griffin held a interest as of november   of which  square feet was occupied 
at december  griffin had  square feet of office and industrial space available for lease with  square feet occupied at that time 
the increase in the amount of square feet available reflects the completion in fiscal of a  square foot facility in the new england tradeport that is fully leased and the completion of the shell of a  square foot office building that is not yet leased 
profit from property sales at griffin land increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal despite the decrease in property sales revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increased profitability reflects the substantially lower cost basis of the land sold in fiscal compared to the cost basis of the land sold in the prior year 
the increase in depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects a full year of depreciation expense in fiscal  as compared to a partial year of depreciation expense in fiscal  on tenant improvements on two buildings totaling  square feet placed in service during fiscal and the start of depreciation on the  square foot building that was completed in fiscal the lower general and administrative expenses reflects a decrease of million in donations expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal and a decrease of million in employee recruitment expenses partially offset by higher insurance expenses 
imperial incurred an operating loss of million in both fiscal and fiscal excluding the loss from the ssc operations of million before they were sold in january 
the increase in gross profit generated from the higher net sales in fiscal was substantially offset by higher charges for unsaleable inventory  which were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the charges for unsaleable inventory in the current year were caused principally by failures in certain crops  poor results from the propagation of new plants in florida and failure to sell certain parts of the inventory which then became unsaleable 
as a result of these issues  management has made changes in certain horticultural practices and changes of certain personnel 
imperial s gross margin on sales  excluding the charges for unsaleable inventory  was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the higher gross margin on sales was principally due to changes in imperial s product mix 
imperial s operating expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  excluding the effect of the sscs in fiscal the lower operating expenses in fiscal reflect principally lower central overhead expenses at imperial due to headcount reductions as a result of the sale of the sscs in fiscal griffin s interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher interest reflects increased borrowings outstanding in fiscal as compared to fiscal borrowings in the current year were used to support the working capital needs at griffin s businesses  and investment in griffin land s real estate operation and capital expenditures at imperial 
griffin s financing requirements in fiscal were met using the proceeds from the sale of the sscs that remained after paying down the balance then outstanding of griffin s revolving credit agreement 
griffin s average amount of debt outstanding in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal in addition  in fiscal griffin had capitalized interest of million as compared to capitalized interest of million in fiscal the lower amount of capitalized interest in fiscal reflects the lower amount of construction activity in fiscal as compared to fiscal griffin s effective rate of the income tax benefit in fiscal is as compared to an effective income tax rate of in fiscal the high effective benefit rate in fiscal reflects the tax benefit on its pretax loss and the release of a liability of million for income taxes as a result of a favorable outcome of tax examinations for earlier years 
the tax examinations were made on tax returns filed by culbro corporation culbro  griffin s parent company prior to the distribution the distribution of griffin common stock to culbro s shareholders in under a tax sharing agreement  the liability for income taxes was assumed by griffin from culbro at the time of the distribution 
the high effective tax rate in fiscal reflects a basis difference in the writedown of an investment 
griffin s equity income from centaur was million in fiscal as compared to an equity loss of million in fiscal the higher equity income in fiscal reflects the gain at centaur from the sale of its lawtel operation  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
there was no cash received by griffin from the sale because centaur used the proceeds to pay down its debt 
partially offsetting the gain on the sale of lawtel was a goodwill impairment charge at centaur  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
griffin s equity income from centaur in fiscal also benefited from the reversal by centaur of a valuation allowance on certain of its deferred tax assets  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
the equity loss in fiscal included a charge  of which griffin s allocable share was million  for expenses related to a proposed stock offering or sale that did not take place 
excluding the effect of these items  griffin s equity results from centaur were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting a weakened economy in the united kingdom which has resulted in lower revenue and lower operating results at centaur 
off balance sheet arrangements griffin does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal the decrease of million of net cash used in operating activities principally reflects an increase of million in accounts payable and current liabilities in fiscal as compared to a decrease of million in fiscal  reflecting timing of payments  particularly for construction work at griffin land 
partially offsetting the effect of the favorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were net unfavorable changes in accounts receivable and inventories 
included in fiscal operating activities was a million lease inducement payment related to a lease extension with a major tenant in one of griffin land s industrial buildings 
the terms of the lease extension require griffin land to make certain improvements to the property 
the cost to griffin land of the incentive payment and tenant improvements  in total  is not expected to exceed million 
most of the expenditures for the improvements will be in the first half of fiscal the new lease rates consider the inducement payment and tenant improvements  including an interest factor  to provide griffin land an appropriate return on its investment of these initial costs over the term of the lease 
griffin land has received a commitment from the mortgage holder on this building and another property in the new england tradeport for an additional million mortgage on those buildings 
the mortgage is expected to be completed in the second quarter after completion and acceptance of the tenant improvements 
net cash used in investing activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million reflects million used in fiscal for the acquisition of the remaining interest in a joint venture that owned two office buildings aggregating approximately  square feet in which griffin land held a interest 
a deposit of million  made in fiscal  was applied against the purchase price of the interest of the joint venture 
additions to real estate held for sale or lease increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million principally reflects a million increase in spending on new construction in fiscal  due to the shell of an approximately  square foot facility in the new england tradeport built in fiscal on speculation and a million increase in fiscal capital spending for building improvements and infrastructure improvements in griffin land s office and industrial parks 
additions to real estate held for sale or lease in fiscal principally included construction  on speculation  of the shell of a  square foot office building 
additions to property and equipment  principally for imperial  decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease of million principally reflects the completion  in early fiscal  of the expansion of imperial s northern florida growing operation that had been ongoing during the past four years 
over that time  imperial has expanded and improved its facilities in connecticut and northern florida at a total cost of million 
capital expenditures at imperial in fiscal are expected to be less than million  consistent with capital spending in fiscal but substantially lower than the earlier three years  because the expansion of imperial s growing operations was completed in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million reflects the completion in fiscal of a million nonrecourse mortgage on the two office buildings that griffin land acquired the remaining interest from a joint venture in december additionally  borrowings under griffin s revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with fleet national bank fleet increased by million from million at november  to million at november  the proceeds from the increase in debt were used to a acquire the interest in the real estate joint venture  b finance construction and development activities in the real estate business  and c fund operations in the landscape nursery business 
in fiscal  griffin is planning to continue to invest in its real estate business 
in addition to the improvements that will be made in conjunction with the lease extension described above  additional amounts will be required to complete the interiors of the shells of the office and the industrial buildings that were recently built on speculation 
the buildout of the interiors of these buildings will be started when leases are obtained 
griffin land will also continue to seek approval for its proposed residential developments  including a newly proposed lot subdivision in suffield  connecticut  the proposed development in simsbury  connecticut that is currently in litigation and the sale of the remaining development rights of griffin land s walden woods development in windsor  connecticut 
griffin land has an agreement for the sale of those development rights  but completion of the transaction is subject to the purchaser receiving approval of their plans by the town s land use commissions 
based on the terms currently contemplated  proceeds from that sale are expected to be approximately million  although completion of this transaction is not expected to take place in fiscal griffin land intends to proceed with residential development plans on other of its lands that are also appropriate for that use 
griffin s payments including principal and interest under contractual obligations as of november  are as follows total due within one year due from years due from years due in more than years in millions mortgages credit agreement capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other reflects the amount outstanding for the credit agreement as of november  due to the variable interest rate on this debt  interest for future periods is not included above 
includes commitments made as of november  for the purchase of services and materials for improvements to one of griffin land s industrial buildings related to a lease extension with a major tenant  a portion of which will be reimbursed by the tenant 
includes griffin s deferred compensation plan and other post retirement benefits liabilities 
the credit agreement is used to finance working capital requirements at griffin s landscape nursery and real estate businesses and for investment in griffin s real estate assets 
the credit agreement is collateralized by certain of griffin s real estate assets and includes financial covenants with respect to griffin s fixed charge coverage as defined  net worth and leverage 
at november   griffin was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage covenant of the credit agreement 
griffin has recently amended the credit agreement with fleet the fourth amendment 
the fourth amendment includes a waiver of such non compliance  amends the fixed charge coverage covenant and adds a minimum earnings before interest and taxes covenant 
the fourth amendment requires griffin to pledge the accounts receivable and inventory of imperial as additional collateral for the credit agreement and also requires griffin to either a complete the sale of griffin s investment in centaur by may  see below with the proceeds used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement  or b raise a minimum of million in debt and equity financing by june  accordingly  the amount outstanding under the credit agreement at november  is included in current liabilities on griffin s balance sheet 
as part of the requirement to raise additional capital if the sale of centaur is not completed  griffin s president and chief executive officer has committed to fleet bank to exercise stock options which would generate proceeds of million to griffin 
on january   griffin and the other principal shareholders of centaur executed a heads of agreement a preliminary agreement providing for the sale of all of the outstanding equity interests in centaur 
consummation of the sale is subject to numerous contingencies  including without limitation  the satisfactory completion of due diligence and the receipt of sufficient financing by the buyer 
the form of consideration to be received by griffin in the transaction would be principally cash  but would include some securities of the buyer 
based on the terms of the heads of agreement  griffin s gain on this transaction would be in the range of in excess of per share  although  under certain circumstances  the gain with respect to that portion of the proceeds received in the form of securities may be deferred until the sale of the related securities 
completion of the sale of centaur under the current terms and in the currently expected time frame would satisfy griffin s requirements to raise additional capital under the fourth amendment to the credit agreement and would fund all of griffin s expected capital requirements 
management believes that if the sale of centaur is not completed  in the near term  cash flow after debt service and borrowings available under the credit agreement  as amended  may need to be supplemented to finance the working capital requirements of imperial during the upcoming peak cash usage period in spring under the fourth amendment to the credit agreement  griffin is required to complete the sale of centaur before may  or raise additional capital before june  as there can be no assurance that the centaur transaction will be completed in a time frame that would satisfy the requirements of the fourth amendment  or completed at all  management is in the process of preparing to raise the additional capital required by the fourth amendment 
although there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms that management finds acceptable  or at all  management believes that it will raise the required capital 
if griffin is unable to complete the sale of its investment in centaur before may  or raise the required additional capital before june   griffin would be in default under its credit agreement and may be required to reduce or delay certain expenditures in spring over the intermediate and long term  additional mortgage placements  construction financing or additional credit facilities may be required to fund capital projects 
forward looking information the above information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
although griffin believes that its plans  intentions and expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such plans  intentions or expectations will be achieved  particularly with respect to the expansion and improved return on assets of imperial s operations  construction and leasing of additional facilities in the real estate business  completion of the sale of the development rights of walden woods  approval of other proposed residential subdivisions  completing the sale of centaur and obtaining the additional financing required under the fourth amendment to the credit agreement 
the projected information disclosed herein is based on assumptions and estimates that  while considered reasonable by griffin as of the date hereof  are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of griffin 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
for fixed rate mortgage debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not earnings or cash flows 
griffin does not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and therefore  interest rate risk and changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt should not have a significant impact on earnings or cash flows until such debt is refinanced  if necessary 
griffin s mortgage interest rates and related principal payment requirements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
griffin had million of variable rate debt outstanding at november  an increase in interest rates of would have increased griffin s interest expense by million 
griffin is exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on market values of griffin s cash equivalent short term investments 
these investments generally consist of overnight investments that are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk  except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned and cash flow from these investments 
griffin does not currently have any derivative financial instruments in place to manage interest costs  but that does not mean that griffin will not use them as a means to manage interest rate risk in the future 
griffin does not use foreign currency exchange forward contracts or commodity contracts and does not have foreign currency exposure in operations 
griffin does have investments in privately owned companies based in the united kingdom 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could affect the results of an equity investment in griffin s financial statements 
the companies have historically reinvested their earnings for future growth 
the ultimate liquidation of those investments and conversion of proceeds into united states currency is subject to future foreign currency exchange rates
