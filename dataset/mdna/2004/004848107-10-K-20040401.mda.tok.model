item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and trend information the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed in item description of business factors that may influence future results 
we operate in three reportable segments software consulting and development  energy intelligence solutions  and computer hardware 
as we no longer have control over our formerly consolidated subsidiary comverge see note to the consolidated financial statements  effective as of the second quarter of  we account for our investment in comverge by the equity method and no longer consolidate comverge s balances and operating activity into our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations 
the following analysis should be read together with the segment information provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
software consulting and development segment revenues decreased in compared to  causing continuing losses despite the significant cost cutting measures instituted during the past two years 
the decrease resulted primarily from the continued general weakness in the global hi tech markets and in the software consulting and development market in particular 
we currently expect segment revenues to increase in  this increase  coupled with the improved cost structure achieved  lead us to believe that this segment will return to profitability in beginning in the fourth quarter of  we started recognizing revenues from the contract signed with clalit health services  israel s largest hmo and one of the largest hmos in the world  which awarded our dsit subsidiary  together with yael software  a million contract  of which dsit s portion is approximately 
the contract includes the development and implementation of a new customer care and billing system  based entirely on dsit s e asybilltm billing system 
the system  to be implemented over a one year period with a seven year maintenance contract  is expected to generate revenues in the years through in the future  we expect that this product  as well as our oncoprotm product and sonar technology systems  will have increased impact on our results of operations 
in addition  the consulting market seems to be stabilizing and even showing certain signs of growth that leave us optimistic regarding revenues from this activity in finally  dsit has been successful in bidding together with databit from our computer hardware segment for certain israeli ministry of defense mod contracts and we expect this cooperation to produce increased revenues in the future 
energy intelligence solutions during  comverge signed and closed on agreements see note to our consolidated financial statements for private equity financing totaling million 
we invested million in these financings  and million was invested by a group of leading energy venture capital investors  in exchange for series a convertible preferred stock of comverge 
comverge s operating results for the period from january  to march  have been consolidated and are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
our share of comverge s operating results for the period from april  to december  effective april  is reflected in share of losses in comverge in our consolidated statements of operations 
in  comverge saw a decrease in the market for its dcu and superstat families of products  causing a general decrease in sales 
in addition  in comverge devoted significant attention to the capital raising process mentioned above 
however  during this period  comverge signed its first two major  long term virtual peaking capacitytm contracts to provide significant peak load reduction to pacificorp  a subsidiary of scottish power  and to san diego gas and electric  a subsidiary of sampora energy 
although little revenue was recognized with respect to these contracts in  we expect them to have a positive effect on revenues in future periods 
comverge signed a year contract extension modifying the contract with gulf power for price responsive load management 
although this modification is expected to bring the contract s total revenues to an excess of million  it will reduce revenues from this contract in the short term 
however  it is not expected to negatively impact overall operating results of comverge 
over the longer term  the contract modification is expected to improve this project s profitability  due to product improvements and reductions in component costs 
computer hardware sales in were lower than sales in  primarily due to the extraordinarily high amount of sales in the fourth quarter of we currently expect to maintain average sales in at a level similar to that of the fourth quarter of  by further expanding our new offices in southern new jersey and on the west coast 
in addition  to offset the weakness in the hardware resale market  we are attempting to diversify our revenue base and have initiated efforts toward alternatives adding more value added software products and services 
these activities  together with continuing joint marketing efforts with dsit for israeli ministry of defense projects  are intended to reduce databit s dependency on the computer hardware markets in the future 
corporate comverge has been successful in raising approximately million and establishing bank credit lines of million  so that although we no longer have control over comverge activities  we do not need to further fund comverge operations 
george morgenstern  our chairman and chief executive officer  has retired from full time employment  initiating his consulting contract as of january   and has agreed to make himself available to fill other appropriate positions the board may desire 
in light of our reduced involvement with comverge  the independent management in place at our dsit and databit subsidiaries and our ceo s semi retirement  we continue to evaluate our corporate activities and structure 
this evaluation includes exploration of restructuring  acquisitions or mergers and or other strategic alternatives 
to assist us in this effort  we have retained foresight  a strategic and financial consulting and research firm  to perform a valuation of our subsidiaries and comverge  as well as perform other analysis to be utilized by our board of directors in its exploration of possible strategic alternatives 
we expect to continue this process and complete it within the next few months 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies represents our attempt to report on those accounting policies which we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosure 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies affecting our company principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies  revenue recognition  foreign currency transactions  inventory  income taxes  and goodwill and other long lived assets 
principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
minority interests in net losses are limited to the extent of their equity capital 
losses in excess of minority interest equity capital are charged against us in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in associated companies are accounted for by the equity method 
in april  we  together with our then consolidated subsidiary  comverge  signed and closed on a definitive agreement with a syndicate of venture capital firms raising an aggregate of  in capital funding 
we purchased  of series a convertible preferred stock issued by comverge in the equity financing and incurred transaction costs of an additional in december  we invested an additional in series a convertible preferred stock 
a syndicate of venture capital firms purchased  of series a convertible preferred stock issued by comverge  and one member of the syndicate also purchased  of series a convertible preferred stock of comverge 
in connection with the transaction  we also converted to equity intercompany balances of  as a result of comverge securing its equity investments  we no longer control comverge s activity and we are no longer required to nor have any intention to fund comverge s activity 
in connection with comverge s april equity financing transactions  comverge acquired sixth dimension  inc in a purchase business combination  valued at approximately  in exchange for  of comverge s common shares 
in connection with this transaction  as a result of our dilution and the new valuation of comverge s common stock  we recorded an increase of  to our common stock investment in comverge 
the adjustment was recorded to additional paid in capital 
following comverge s first equity transaction of the year  we held approximately of the outstanding capital voting stock of comverge approximately of comverge s common stock and approximately of comverge s preferred stock 
as a result of the transaction  we are no longer obligated to fund comverge 
additionally  as a result of the april equity transactions  we have a negative investment balance in comverge s common stock of  due to our commitment to no longer fund comverge  we have ceased to record equity losses against our common stock investment 
our negative common investment will only be adjusted upon disposition of the our common stock investment or when we realize equity income from comverge in excess of any accumulated equity losses recorded on our preferred stock investment 
our preferred stock investment of  which was primarily financed by the release of  of previously restricted cash has been reduced by equity losses in comverge for the period of april  to december  of in september  comverge completed an agreement raising an additional  in capital funding in exchange for additional series a convertible preferred stock issued by comverge 
comverge utilized these funds to repurchase the series a convertible preferred stock previously issued by comverge 
in october  comverge completed an agreement raising an additional  in capital funding in exchange for additional series a convertible preferred stock issued by comverge 
following the equity transactions in  we remained comverge s largest shareholder  owning approximately of the outstanding capital voting stock of comverge  which is comprised of approximately of the preferred stock and approximately of comverge s common stock 
as a result of the private equity financing transactions  comverge is no longer a controlled subsidiary of ours 
thus  effective april   we no longer consolidated comverge s balance sheet and results of operations  and from that date  accounted for our investment in comverge on the equity method 
as a result of comverge s net loss during the nine months ended december   we recognized  as equity loss representing of comverge s losses for the period from april to september  and of comverge s losses for the period from october to december  against our preferred stock investment 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
revenue from time and materials service contracts  maintenance agreements and other services are recognized as services are provided 
revenue on the sale of products and software are recognized when substantial evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery or shipment has occurred and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
such revenues generally do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in  we derived million of revenues from fixed price contracts  all of which are attributable to our software and consulting development segment  representing approximately of consolidated sales in million and  and million and  in and  respectively  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method as costs primarily direct labor are incurred  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future revenue and consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting changes in revenues and reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
foreign currency transactions the currency of the primary economic environment in which our corporate headquarters and our us subsidiaries operate is the united states dollar dollar 
accordingly  the company and all of its us subsidiaries use the dollar as their functional currency 
we have several israeli subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december  for the year ended december   and of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  
the financial statements of the company s israeli subsidiaries whose functional currency is the new israeli shekel nis have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statements of operations amounts have been translated using the exchange rate at date of transaction 
in  and the resulting translation adjustments are not reported  since the effect is immaterial all exchange gains and losses denominated in non dollar currencies are reflected in other income loss  net in the consolidated statement of operations when they arise 
such foreign currency gains losses  net amounted to  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories to establish a new cost basis 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories at december  and was and  respectively 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
income taxes we have a history of unprofitable operations from losses incurred in a number of our operations 
these losses generated sizeable state  federal and foreign tax net operating loss nol carryforwards as of december  of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset associated with these nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes 
due to our history of unprofitable operations  we only recognize net deferred tax assets in those subsidiaries in which we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize them to offset future income taxes in the future 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes on current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax assets at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates or foreign rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax assets could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
goodwill and other long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets held for use whenever circumstances indicate there may be an impairment 
for all assets excluding goodwill  the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
if this occurs  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value is determined by applying a market rate multiple to the estimated near term future revenue stream expected to be produced by the segment 
effective july  and january   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these accounting standards  we no longer amortize our goodwill and are required to complete an annual impairment test 
for the purpose of implementing sfas no 
 we have designated the fourth quarter as the period of the annual test and determined that we have three reporting units  which are the same as our three reportable segments 
in we came to the conclusion that due to the slow down in the hi tech markets  we recognize an expense for the impairment of goodwill and acquired software of million million net of minority interests 
no impairment was found in the annual assessment for the year ended december  as of december   we had an aggregate of million of goodwill  all of which relates to our software consulting and development segment 
additionally  at december   we had million net book value of other identifiable intangible assets 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation issued to non employees on a fair value basis in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and related interpretations 
the company uses the black scholes valuation method to estimate the fair value of the warrants 
for warrants granted in the company used a risk free interest rate of  their contractual life of two years  an annual volatility of and no expected dividends 
the company estimated the fair value of these warrants to be approximately  which has been charged to selling  general and administrative expense

of the million decrease in sales in compared to  million was due to comverge  which  since the second quarter of  is no longer fully consolidated 
sales decreased in the computer hardware sales segment by million  primarily due to the non recurrence of the extraordinarily high segment sales in the fourth quarter of in the software consulting and development segment  sales decreased by million  primarily due to the decrease in the number of consultants and development projects in this decrease is primarily attributable to the downturn in the high tech market in general and the software consulting and development market in particular 
gross profit 
the decrease in gross profits and gross profit margins in as compared to was also primarily due to our company no longer fully consolidating comverge s operations since the second quarter of this accounted for million of the million decrease 
in addition  as comverge s gross profit margin was higher than the average in the group  ceasing to consolidate its operations caused a decrease in our consolidated gross profit margin 
gross profit in the computer hardware segment decreased in by million  primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in sales 
in the software consulting and development segment  despite the significant decrease in sales  gross profits remained relatively stable  with gross profit margins improving from in to in  due to the improved cost structure achieved as a result of cost cutting measures implemented over the last two years  and the completion of most of the projects running at lower profit margins in previous periods 
research and development expenses r d 
the decrease in r d expenses was primarily due to our company no longer consolidating comverge s operations since the second quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
the discontinued full consolidation of comverge s operations since the second quarter of accounted for million of the million decrease in sg a expenses in as compared to however  sg a decreased in all our other activities as well 
in the software consulting and development segment  sg a decreased by million  or  as a result of cost cutting measures begun in and continuing through sg a in our computer hardware sales segment also decreased by million  primarily due to reduced commissions on reduced sales 
finally  corporate sg a also decreased primarily due to reduced professional fees and compensation expenses 
we presently expect to be able to maintain the current level of expenses in the software consulting and development segment and further reduce corporate sg a as we reduce compensation expenses as a result of our ceo retiring and the implementation of his consulting agreement 
interest income expense 
the decrease in net finance expenses is attributable to completing the accretion of discounts and the amortization of related costs in connection with convertible debt and warrants in and the first few months of  which accounted for approximately half the interest expense in other loss  net 
the other loss in was primarily attributable to the write off of a stockholder s note received from comverge s ceo 
equity loss in unconsolidated subsidiary 
the equity loss in was attributable to comverge  whose results we account for on an equity basis as of the second quarter of see note of our consolidated financial statements 
our share of comverge s million net losses during the period from april  to december  was million 
comverge s increased losses in of million  compared to million in  was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales  particularly those related to comverge s family of dcu and superstattm products as well as those stemming from its gulf power contract  where shipments have been suspended 
sales from the vpn contracts will primarily effect future periods 
in addition  sg a in comverge has increased primarily due to increased advertising and marketing expenses  particularly those related to marketing and advertising its new utah pacificorp program 
minority interests 
minority interests reflect the minority interests in losses generated by our dsit subsidiary 
compared to sales 
sales in were million  increasing by million  or  from million in  due to sales increases in all segments 
energy intelligence solution sales increased by million  or  from million in  to million in the increase in this segment s sales was primarily attributable to fulfillment of a large contract to sell our maingate c i and powercamp systems to a major utility and to a generally higher level of business 
sales in the computer hardware segment continued to improve  increasing by million  or  from million in  to million in although sales in this segment were improving through the year  the increase was primarily attributable to the million in sales in the fourth quarter of the increase in the fourth quarter of was primarily attributable to sales of million to a single customer 
software consulting and development sales increased by million  or  from million in  to million in this improvement in sales was entirely attributable to the expanded revenue base achieved as a result of the endan acquisition by dsit in december  which more than offset the general weakness in the global hi tech markets and in the software consulting and development market in particular 
gross profit 
gross profit in was million  increasing by million  or  compared to  with gross profit margins improving from in to in the increase in gross profits was attributable to improvements in all segments  particularly in the energy intelligence solutions segment 
gross profit in the energy intelligence solution segment increased by million  or  from million  or of sales  in to million  or of sales  in the increase in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to a million settlement with a former contract manufacturer and an increase of approximately million in sales of products of higher margin products 
in the computer hardware segment  gross profit increased by million  or  primarily due to the increase in sales 
gross profit in the software consulting and development segment also increased by million  or  from million  or of sales  in  to million  or of sales  in the increase in gross profits was primarily attributable to the increase in sales  as well as improved cost structure 
research and development expenses r d 
r d expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to a decrease in r d expenditures in the energy intelligence solution segment  as it shifted its emphasis from r d in to marketing and sales in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
despite the significant increase in sales  sg a remained relatively stable  increasing by million  from million in  to million in impairment of goodwill and investment 
the entire expense recorded was due to our software consulting and development segment 
with the acquisition of endan by our dsit subsidiary in december  we recognized goodwill and acquired software valued at a total of million 
this value was supported by third party valuations prepared at the time of the acquisition  based on sales and business projections made at that time 
since then  the hi tech market in general and that of software consulting in particular have continued to deteriorate 
as a result  we recorded in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
in addition  we recorded a write down of  with respect to an investment in a start up company 
interest income expense 
to finance our operations  we utilized our investments  raised capital by issuing convertible debentures  and obtained lines of credit 
the utilization of our investments caused the decrease in interest income and we expect interest income to further decrease in future periods 
we incurred finance expenses in connection with the capital raised including interest and amortization of costs associated with the convertible debt and warrants issued 
although the interest associated with the utilization of lines of credit is expected to continue at the current level  the amortization expenses are expected to decrease over the future quarters 
of the million of interest expense during the year ended december   million was related to the accretion of discounts and the amortization of related costs in connection with convertible debt and warrants 
minority interests 
minority interests reflect the minority interests in losses generated by our dsit subsidiary  primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and acquired software in this segment as described above 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including million in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in operating activities in was million  all of which was used to finance corporate expenses  which totaled million 
our controlled operating entities had positive cash flow from operations 
we believe that the proceeds of the financing and new credit arrangements acquired by comverge provide sufficient financing for comverge to independently fund its operations 
due to significant interest in comverge held by others and other restrictions  working capital and cash flows of comverge will not be available to finance other us activities 
of the total working capital at december   million was in our majority owned dsit subsidiary 
due to israeli tax and company law constraints as well as the significant minority interest in dsit  such working capital and cash flows from dsit s operations are not available to finance us activities 
as at december   dsit was utilizing million of its million line of credit 
dsit s line of credit is denominated in nis and bears interest at a rate equal to the israeli prime rate plus per annum 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december   was 
we believe that dsit will have sufficient liquidity to finance its activities from cash flow from its own operations over the next months 
this is based on continued utilization of its line of credit and improved operating results stemming from continued cost reductions as well as growth in sales 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to finance our us based operating activities and our corporate activities for at least the months following the date of this report  utilizing the cash on hand of million as of march  and operating cash flow from expected profitable operations of the computer hardware segment 
however  due to our liquidity  successful implementation of our plans is subject to risk and uncertainties  including those associated with i maintaining and further increasing the level of revenues obtained in the fourth quarter of  and ii effective and timely implementation of cost reductions already begun 
our long term liquidity is contingent on our ability to increase our revenue and profit base  become cash flow neutral in our us based activities and attracting equity investments to the extent required 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations and commitments at december   excluding certain severance arrangements described below  principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness  future minimum operating lease obligations and contractual obligations to our ceo for payments for his post retirement consulting services to us  and are as set forth in the following table cash payments due during year ending december  in thousands after contractual obligations total long term debt related to israeli operations  guarantees operating leases   consulting agreement with ceo   total contractual cash obligations    we expect to finance these contractual commitments from cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we also have obligations under various agreements and other arrangements with officers and other employees with respect to severance arrangements and multiyear employment agreements 
previously  we accrued a loss for contingent performance of bank guarantees  the balance of which was  at december  a portion of these guarantees was collateralized by means of a deposit of  as of december  although we ve accrued this loss  we contested this liability and expect an israeli supreme court decision in this regard within the next few months 
under israeli law and labor agreements  dsit is required to make severance payments to dismissed employees and to employees leaving employment under certain other circumstances 
the obligation for severance pay benefits  as determined by the israeli severance pay law  is based upon length of service and last salary 
these obligations are substantially covered by regular deposits with recognized severance pay and pension funds and by the purchase of insurance policies 
as of december   we accrued a total of million for potential severance obligations  of which approximately million was funded with cash to insurance companies 
under the terms of his employment agreement with us  we have an obligation to pay our chief executive officer consulting fees over a seven year period starting january  during the first four years of the consulting period  we have to pay our ceo  per year  equal to of his salary in effect as of december  during the last three years of the consulting period  we must pay  per year  equal to of that salary 
in addition  we must pay contributions to a non qualified defined contribution retirement plan equal to of the consulting fee 
in accordance with the employment contract  we are obliged to fund amounts payable for the term of the consulting period by the purchase of an annuity or similar investment product at the beginning of the consulting period 
the ceo has agreed to forgo the commitment of immediate funding for the next twelve months or until we acquire additional funding 
we also have a severance arrangement under an employment agreement with our chief financial officer to pay severance under certain circumstances 
if our cfo employment agreement is terminated by us or by him for reasons other than for cause  we must pay him i an amount equal to of his last month s salary multiplied by the number of years including partial years that the cfo worked for us  plus ii an amount equal to six times his last month s salary 
our severance obligation would be reduced by the amount contributed by us to certain israeli pension and severance funds pursuant to the cfo s employment agreement 
as of december   the unfunded portion of such severance obligation was  we also have a severance arrangement under an employment agreement with the chief executive officer of dsit to pay severance under certain circumstances 
if his employment agreement is terminated by us or by him for reasons other than for cause  we must pay him i an amount equal to his last month s salary multiplied by the number of years including partial years that he worked for endan and dsit 
our severance obligation would be reduced by the amount contributed by us to certain israeli pension and severance funds pursuant to his employment agreement 
as of december   the unfunded portion of such severance obligation was  impact of inflation and currency fluctuations a majority of our sales are denominated in dollars 
the remaining portion is primarily denominated in nis  linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
the majority of our expenses in israel are in nis  while a portion is in dollars or dollar linked nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar  should it be significantly different from the rate of inflation 
in the appreciation of the nis against the dollar was  whereas in the devaluation of the nis against the dollar was 
inflation in israel was in and during during the first two months of  the nis was devalued against the dollar by and inflation during this period was 
as of december   virtually all of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
payments to related parties we paid an individual as a director and vice president  who is the son of our chief executive officer  approximately   and  for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we also have engaged certain of our directors and former directors to render professional services to us 
one of our former directors  who is also the son in law of our chief executive officer  is principal of a law firm that we engage to perform legal services for us 
we paid to this firm legal fees and out of pocket disbursements which includes fees and expenses of special counsel hired on our behalf of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the chief executive officer of the company s israeli subsidiary has a loan from the subsidiary that was acquired in the loan balance and accrued interest at december  and was  and  respectively 
the loan has no defined maturity date  is denominated in nis  is linked to the index and bears interest at per annum 
comverge has made loans of  each to both our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
