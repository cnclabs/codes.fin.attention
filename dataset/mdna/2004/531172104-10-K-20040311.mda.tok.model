item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company owns and operates industrial and office properties located primarily in the mid atlantic  southeastern and midwestern united states 
the company focuses on creating value for shareholders and increasing profitability and cash flow 
with respect to its properties in operation  the company endeavors to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates 
the company pursues development opportunities that it believes will create value and yield high returns 
the company also acquires properties which it believes will create long term value  and disposes of properties which no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon income from rental operations and are substantially influenced by rental demand for the properties in operation 
in the company experienced the effects of a generally slow economy and a particularly difficult real estate market for landlords 
these circumstances impacted many aspects of the company s business 
our properties in operation  which represents over of our revenue  were subjected to market conditions characterized by an oversupply of leaseable space and soft demand 
these conditions resulted in downward pressure on rental rates and upward pressure on lease transaction costs related to tenant inducements eg tenant improvement costs 
in the face of these conditions  the company successfully leased million square feet and attained occupancy of  which it believes represents performance which is substantially better than market 
however  property level operating income for the same store properties properties owned since january  declined when compared to year end by on a straight line basis and on a cash basis 
the trend as to occupancy  rental rate and transaction costs remained generally consistent from quarter to quarter in see further discussion of same store results below 
the company believes that  although will be a year of transition  these trends for the properties in operation downward pressure on rents  upward pressure on transaction costs will continue in the aggregate  notwithstanding improvements in some markets 
nevertheless  the company is hopeful that it will see some improvement in overall occupancy in the latter part of the year 
the conditions in for the acquisition of properties were very competitive 
the company  however  acquired buildings representing million square feet and a total investment of million 
these acquisitions generally served to increase the presence or balance the product mix in markets the company believes to have significant potential 
in  the company believes that the level of acquisitions will be in the to million range and will represent a positive contribution to earnings 
dispositions of properties which no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds continued in during  the company sold million in operating properties 
the company anticipates that dispositions will continue at this level or moderately higher in in  the company continued to pursue development opportunities  although principally on a build to suit basis 
the company delivered million of development properties and initiated development of million 
this pipeline of development properties is at a relatively low level as compared to the company s historical pace of development 
the company believes that in build to suit activity will continue and that conditions in certain markets may support the initiation of inventory projects ie projects that are less than leased prior to the commencement of construction 
the company is also hopeful that it will be in a position in to initiate its proposed high rise in philadelphia s central business district  one pennsylvania plaza 
the company is in detailed discussions with various prospective tenants  some of whom are significant enough to justify the commencement of the development of the proposed million square foot office tower 
however  at this time  the company has not entered into a lease with any tenant 
the land and project costs associated with this project represent a substantial investment by the company 
results for the year ended december  have been restated to reflect guidance and clarifications by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the sec s july  clarification of certain issues surrounding eitf topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock  requires the excess of preferred share redemption over carrying amount to be classified as a reduction in income available to common shareholders

decrease in income per common share diluted for the year ended december

the sec has agreed to the disclosure of this non gaap financial measure on a per share basis in its release no 
 conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
the company believes that the calculation of funds from operations is helpful to investors and management as it is a measure of the company s operating performance that excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions

inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  and as a result  it has not had a significant impact on the company during this period 
the million credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the million credit facility will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as in insurance  real estate taxes and utilities  substantially all of the tenants leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its million credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the interest on the million credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the company also uses long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rates for variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
if the interest rate for the fixed rate debt maturing in was basis points higher or lower than its current rate of  the company s interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  the sensitivity analysis above assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
it also does not consider future fluctuations in interest rates or the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to currency risk on its million net investment in the united kingdom 
the company does not believe that this currency risk exposure is material to its financial statements
