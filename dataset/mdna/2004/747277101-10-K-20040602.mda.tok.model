overview we design and supply storage network infrastructure components and software for many of the world s largest server and storage subsystem manufacturers that ultimately are used by small to medium sized enterprises  and companies that have large information technology environments 
we serve customers with solutions based on various storage area network  or san  technologies 
our products are currently based on fibre channel  small computer systems interface  or scsi  and internet scsi  or iscsi standards  and we expect that future products may also be based on technology standards such as serial attached scsi 
we produce the controller chips  management enclosure chips  host bus adapters  or hbas  fabric switches and management software that provide the connectivity infrastructure for every size of storage network 
our ability to serve the storage industry stems from our highly leveraged product line that addresses virtually every connection point in a san infrastructure solution 
on the server side of the san  we provide enclosure management products  hba technology on the motherboard fibre down technology  baseboard management solutions and fibre channel hbas 
connecting servers to storage  we provide the network infrastructure with a full suite of fibre channel switches 
on the storage side of the network  we provide controller chips for redundant array of independent disks  or raid  storage systems 
these include fibre channel host port connections and raid controller to fibre channel and scsi disk drive port connections 
our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and through our authorized distributors and resellers 
these connectivity solutions are incorporated into a variety of products from oem customers  including cisco systems  inc  dell computer corporation  emc corporation  fujitsu limited  hitachi  ltd  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  network appliance  inc  quantum corporation  storage technology corporation  sun microsystems  inc and many others 
fiscal year and fourth quarter financial highlights and other information during fiscal  we established new records for annual net revenues and net income 
net revenues during fiscal of million were up from last year  net income of million in fiscal increased from the prior year 
the results for fiscal were highlighted by a increase in fibre channel sales and an improvement in gross profit percentage of basis points to in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced a sequential decline of in our total net revenues from the third quarter of fiscal fibre channel revenues during the fourth quarter declined sequentially primarily due to weaker than expected demand at the end of the quarter for our host bus adapters from two oems 
revenues derived from scsi products declined sequentially during the fourth quarter due to the continued technology transition in our hard disk drive controller product line from scsi to fibre channel technology 
overall  sales of our hard disk drive controller chips declined during the fourth quarter of fiscal due to an expected product transition by one of our hard disk drive manufacturer customers 
we expect this transition to begin to ramp in the first quarter of fiscal with full production expected during the successive two quarters 
our long term outlook for our core fibre channel business remains favorable 
based on a foundation of design wins in existing markets  as well as emerging markets such as the small to medium business market  
table of contents we continue to expect favorable growth momentum for our fibre channel products 
however  as previously mentioned  the hard disk drive controller chip product transition will continue into the first quarter of fiscal overall  we expect that our total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal will range from flat to a increase from the revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal a summary of the key factors and significant events  which impacted our financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal are as follows net revenues of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased sequentially million  or  from the million reported in the third quarter of fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for the fourth quarter of fiscal  increasing basis points from in the third quarter of fiscal the improvement in our gross profit margin was attributable to a favorable change in product mix and technology mix  and manufacturing related efficiencies 
although we have experienced increases in our gross profit margin during fiscal  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our gross profit margin consistent with historical trends and it may decline in the future 
operating income as a percentage of net revenues was for the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to in the third quarter of fiscal  primarily due to the sequential decline in net revenues 
net income of million  or per diluted share  decreased sequentially from the million  or per diluted share  in the third quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased million of our common stock in the open market under our corporate stock repurchase program 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at march  increased million net of the million of cash used to repurchase our common stock during the fourth quarter  due primarily to our net income and the related cash generated from operations 
working capital of million at march  increased million during the fourth quarter primarily due to our net income and the related cash generated from operations  partially offset by the million of cash used to repurchase our common stock 
accounts receivable was million as of march   compared to million at december  days sales outstanding dso in receivables as of march  decreased to days from days as of december  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by shipment linearity within the quarter and collections performance 
the decrease in our accounts receivable and dso during the fourth quarter of fiscal was primarily caused by the decline in revenues during the quarter and improved collections in the march quarter 
based on changes in our customers procurement models and our current customer mix  we expect that dso will continue to be in the to day range during fiscal however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our dso consistent with historical trends and it may increase in the future 
inventories were million as of march   compared to million at december  our annualized inventory turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal of turns declined from the turns in the third quarter of fiscal  principally due to the increase in inventories related to the buildup to satisfy the expected level of customer purchases at the end of the fourth quarter 

table of contents results of operations net revenues a summary of our net revenues grouped by technology standard is as follows in millions net revenues fibre channel scsi ide total net revenues percentage of net revenues fibre channel scsi ide total net revenues the global marketplace for sans continues to expand in response to the information storage requirements of enterprise and departmental business environments  as well as the emerging small and medium sized business market 
this market expansion has resulted in increased volume shipments of our fibre channel products 
however  the san market has been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
our revenues have generally been favorably affected by increases in volume shipments as a result of market expansion and increases in market share and the release of new products  which tend to have higher average selling prices than the products they are replacing 
the favorable effect on our revenues as a result of increases in volume has been partially offset by the impact of declining prices on older products 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of fibre channel and scsi based products 
we also license certain designs and receive royalty revenues and non recurring engineering fees 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in fibre channel net revenues  due principally to increased shipments of hbas and switches  which volume increases aggregated and  respectively 
these volume increases were partially offset by lower average selling prices 
the increase in fibre channel net revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in sales of scsi products  primarily due to the continued technology transition in our hard disk drive controller product line from scsi to fibre channel technology 
during fiscal  fibre channel revenues represented of our net revenues compared to in the prior year 
net revenues for fiscal included million of royalty revenues and non recurring engineering fees  compared to million of royalty revenues and million non recurring engineering fees  respectively  recorded in the prior year 
although royalty revenues are unpredictable  we do not expect them to be significant to our overall revenues in the future 
net revenues in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was the result of an million increase in fibre channel net revenues and a million increase in scsi net revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in ide based royalties  which had ceased during fiscal the increase in fibre channel revenues in fiscal was primarily the result of increased shipments of hbas  hard disk drive controller chips and management controller chips 
the increase in scsi revenues in fiscal was primarily due to increased shipments of our hard disk drive controllers 
during fiscal  fibre channel revenues represented of our net revenues compared to in fiscal  and we expect our fibre channel revenues to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues due to the transition in our hard disk drive controller product line from scsi to fibre channel technology 

table of contents a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our top five customers accounted for of net revenues during fiscal  of net revenues during fiscal and of net revenues during fiscal a summary of our customers  including their manufacturing subcontractors  that represent or more of our net revenues during each of the fiscal years is as follows sun microsystems fujitsu hitachi less than of net revenues 
we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternative or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can also be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
export revenues primarily to pacific rim countries for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of fibre channel hbas in the united kingdom and the asia pacific region 
export revenues in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal  primarily due to increased sales to our peripheral chip customers in japan 
as a percentage of net revenues  export revenues accounted for in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal export revenues are denominated in us dollars 
revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the country of destination 
no other country represented or more of net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented 
net revenues by geographic area are as follows in millions united states japan united kingdom rest of world gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased products including silicon chips from third party manufacturers  assembly and test services  and costs associated with product procurement  inventory management and product quality 
a summary of our gross profit and related percentage of net revenues is as follows in millions gross profit percentage of net revenues gross profit for fiscal increased million or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal increased basis points from the prior year to 
the increase in gross profit percentage during for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to favorable shifts in the product mix and technology mix  including increased sales of higher margin fibre channel based products 
in 
table of contents addition  the gross profit percentage was favorably affected by manufacturing efficiencies realized from the increase in production and improved inventory management during fiscal  as well as the million increase in royalty revenues 
during fiscal  gross profit increased million or  from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal increased basis points from the prior year to 
the increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to increased sales of higher margin fibre channel based products  as well as manufacturing efficiencies realized from the increase in production 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as the results of our investment in engineering and development activities  supply costs and  in particular  the cost of silicon chips  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  the level of royalties received and our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
also  royalty revenues have been irregular or unpredictable 
as a result of these and other factors  it may be difficult to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical trends and it may decline in the future 
operating expenses our operating expenses are summarized in the following table in millions operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses percentage of net revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  development related engineering and material costs  occupancy costs and related computer support costs 
engineering and development expenses of million for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses in fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in compensation and related benefit costs 
the increase in our headcount and associated costs during fiscal was primarily the result of our continued development efforts in support of products based on the fibre channel and iscsi technologies 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses in fiscal primarily reflects an million increase in compensation and related benefit costs associated with increases in headcount for our expanded development efforts in support of existing and future technologies and the accelerated launch of new products 
in addition  costs associated with depreciation  leased assets and maintenance contracts increased million as result of increased requirements for assets used in engineering and development activities 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving future design wins  expansion of our customer base and revenue growth opportunities 
as a result of continued 
table of contents investments and the increasing costs associated with new product development  we expect engineering and development expenses will continue to increase in the future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  sales commissions  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses of million for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in promotional activities directed at increasing market awareness and acceptance of our products  a million increase in compensation and related benefit costs associated with the continued expansion of our sales and marketing groups and a million increase in travel costs in support of new market and customer opportunities 
during fiscal  sales and marketing expenses of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal primarily reflects an increase of million in compensation and related benefit costs associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing groups  an increase of million in sales commissions earned by independent sales representatives as a result of the significant increase in our net revenues and an increase of million for costs associated with promotional and marketing related programs in support of increased revenues 
we believe continued investments in our sales and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non compensation components of general and administrative expenses include legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to the accrual of settlement costs totaling million associated with legal claims and increased legal costs aggregating million associated with the defense of legal proceedings 
during fiscal  general and administrative expenses of million decreased million  or  from fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal resulted principally from a reduction in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets and a lower provision for uncollectible accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in headcount and personnel related expenses 
the reduction in the amortization expense in fiscal includes million associated with certain intangible assets that were fully amortized in fiscal  and the elimination of million of goodwill amortization in connection with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of april  the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable of million for fiscal resulted from accounts receivable collections more favorable than previously estimated  in fiscal the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was million 
excluding the effect of the reduction of the amortization expense and the provision for uncollectible accounts  our general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  primarily due to an increase in compensation and related benefit costs for additional personnel for the expansion of our corporate infrastructure 
in connection with the growth of our business  we expect general and administrative expenses excluding the costs for legal defense and settlements associated with legal proceedings will continue to increase in the future 
non operating income interest and other income for fiscal of million is comprised principally of interest income related to our portfolio of marketable securities 
the million decline in interest and other income in fiscal 
table of contents from the prior year was due to a decline in investment income during fiscal  partially offset by the million of write downs of non marketable investments recorded in fiscal excluding the effect of the write downs of non marketable securities  interest and other income decreased by million during fiscal  primarily due to a million reduction of gains on sales of investments from the prior year 
in addition  interest income decreased by million due to declining yields on our portfolio of marketable securities  partially offset by increased earnings due to larger investment balances 
during fiscal  interest and other income of million is comprised principally of interest income and investment gains related to our portfolio of marketable securities  partially offset by write downs of non marketable investments 
the million decline in interest and other income in fiscal from the prior year was primarily due to a million write down of non marketable investments and a million decrease in interest income due to declining interest rates on our portfolio of marketable securities  partially offset by a million increase in realized gains on sales of marketable securities 
during fiscal  the carrying values of certain non marketable investments were written down to their estimated fair value of zero 
these investments consisted of equity interests in early stage technology companies which we had accounted for under the cost method 
we estimated the fair value of these investments based on available financial and other information  including the then current and projected business prospects for the subject companies  and determined that the decline in the fair value of these investments was other than temporary 
income taxes our effective tax rate approximated in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the tax rate in fiscal and was due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes  without a corresponding increase in tax benefits associated with research activities and export sales 
although we do not expect our effective tax rate to increase at a rate consistent with the recent historical trend  we do expect upward pressure on our effective tax rate in fiscal for substantially the same reason experienced in fiscal and furthermore  the pending expiration of the federal research credit on june  and the anticipated repeal of tax benefits associated with export sales may have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate during fiscal liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments have increased to million at march   compared to million at march  the increase was attributable to positive cash flow from operations  primarily net income  during fiscal our working capital  during fiscal  increased million to million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments and cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to supplement our existing sources of liquidity to finance our activities beyond the next months or for the future acquisition of businesses  products or technologies 
in addition  our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including changes in the markets we address  our revenues and the related manufacturing and operating costs  product development efforts and requirements for production capacity 
in order to fund any additional capital requirements  we may seek to obtain debt financing or issue additional shares of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing  if necessary  will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increase in the cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in net income  partially offset by a larger investment in working capital during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the operating cash flow for fiscal reflects our net income of million and million of non cash charges depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and other  partially offset by a net increase in the non cash components of our working capital of million 
the increase in the non cash components of working capital was primarily due to a million increase in accounts receivable as a result of an overall increase in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal over the corresponding period of fiscal and an increase in days sales outstanding from days at the end of fiscal to days at the end of fiscal as a result of 
table of contents changes in our customers procurement models and our current customer mix 
in addition  the increase in non cash components of working capital included an million decrease in income taxes payable  partially offset by an increase in operating liabilities associated with the expansion of our business and the related timing of the payment obligations 
cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal includes net purchases of marketable securities of million and additions to property and equipment of million 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities of million  included net purchases of marketable securities of million and additions to property and equipment of million 
we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future consistent with the growth in our business  as we continue to invest in machinery and equipment  more costly engineering and production tools for new technologies  and enhancements to our corporate information technology infrastructure 
cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal resulted from our purchase of million of treasury stock  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
during fiscal  the million of cash provided by financing activities resulted from million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans  partially offset by our purchase of million of treasury stock 
in october  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire our outstanding common stock 
under the program  up to million of our common stock may be repurchased over two years 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as of march   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million since inception of the program 
the shares repurchased have been taken in as treasury shares and will be held as treasury shares until our board of directors designates that these shares be retired or used for some other purpose 
during april and may  we purchased an additional  shares of common stock under the stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of million 
with these purchases of common stock  we have repurchased the entire amount authorized pursuant to the program 
we have certain contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
a summary of our contractual obligations and their impact on our cash flows in future fiscal years is as follows total in millions operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
these accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

table of contents revenue and accounts receivable we sell our products domestically and internationally primarily through oems  and distribution channel customers including distributors  system integrators and value added resellers 
our significant customers include leading storage solution providers  server oems and storage oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of shipment and are not dependent on subsequent resale of our products 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right to return unsold product 
we recognize revenue from these distributors when the product is sold by the distributor to a third party 
royalty and service revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is assured 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these reserves are determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and applying historical loss rates to the aging of remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due  additional reserves might be required 
we record provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated product returns and allowances such as competitive pricing programs and rebates in the same period that revenue is recognized 
these provisions are based on historical experience as well as specifically identified product returns and allowance programs 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to ensure they approximate actual costs 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to market value for estimated obsolete or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we compare current inventory levels on a product basis to our current sales forecasts in order to assess our inventory balance 
our sales forecasts are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 

table of contents risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
our stock price may be volatile which could affect the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially  and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue 
several factors could impact our stock price including  but not limited to announcements concerning our competitors  our customers  or us  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by our competitors or us  conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in market projections by industry forecasters  changes in estimates of our earnings by industry analysts  overall market conditions for high technology equities  rumors or dissemination of false information  and general economic conditions  including terrorist activities or military actions 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years and stock prices of technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline if our results fail to meet investors and analysts expectations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current gross margins or profitability in the future 
a significant portion of our net revenues in each fiscal quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
orders placed by major customers are typically based on their forecasted sales and inventory levels for our products 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be the result of changes in purchasing patterns by one or more of our customers  order changes or rescheduling  gain or loss of significant customers  customer policies pertaining to desired inventory levels of our products  negotiated rebates and extended payment terms  changes in our ability to anticipate in advance the mix of customer orders  levels of inventory our customers require us to maintain in our inventory hub locations  the time  availability and sale of new products  changes in the mix or average selling prices of our products  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  
table of contents the availability and cost of components  including silicon chips  warranty expenses  variations in product development costs  especially related to advanced technologies  variations in operating expenses  adjustments related to product returns  changes in effective income tax rates  including those resulting from changes in tax laws  adoption of new accounting pronouncements or changes in our policies  general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  or changes in the global economy that impact information technology spending 
our quarterly results of operations are also influenced by competitive factors  including the pricing and availability of our products or our competitors products 
although we do not maintain our own silicon chip manufacturing facility  portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
if net revenues do not meet our expectations  our fixed expenses could adversely affect our gross profit and net income until net revenues increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to an appropriate level 
furthermore  announcements regarding new products and technologies could cause our customers to defer or cancel purchases of our products 
order deferrals by our customers  delays in our introduction of new products  and longer than anticipated design in cycles for our products have in the past adversely affected our quarterly results of operations 
due to these factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and as a result  the price of our common stock could significantly decrease 
our business is dependent on the continued growth of the storage area network san market and if this market does not continue to develop and expand as we anticipate  our business will suffer 
a significant number of our products are used in sans and  therefore  our business is dependent on the san market 
accordingly  the widespread adoption of sans for use in organizations computing systems is critical to our future success 
sans are often implemented in connection with the deployment of new storage systems and servers 
therefore  our future success is also substantially dependent on the market for new storage systems and servers 
our success in generating revenue in the san market will depend on  among other things  our ability to educate potential oem customers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  storage service providers and end user organizations about the benefits of sans  maintain and enhance our relationships with oem customers  distributors  resellers  system integrators and storage system providers  predict and base our products on standards which ultimately become industry standards  and achieve interoperability between our products and other san components from diverse vendors 
our financial condition will be materially harmed if we do not maintain and gain market or industry acceptance of our products 
the markets in which we compete involve rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in products and services 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our current products and develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and industry standards  compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  and 
table of contents adequately address oem customer and end user customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe that to remain competitive in the future  we will need to continue to develop new products  which will require a significant investment in new product development 
although we continue to explore and develop products based on new technologies  a substantial portion of our revenues is generated from fibre channel technology 
our competitors are developing alternative technologies  such as iscsi  infiniband tm  serial attached scsi sas and serial advanced technology attachment sata that may compete with the market acceptance of our fibre channel products 
if alternative standards are adopted by the industry  we may not be able to develop products for new standards in a timely manner 
further  even if alternative technologies do augment fibre channel revenues  our products may not be fully developed in time to be accepted by our customers 
even if our new products are developed on time  we may not be able to manufacture them at competitive prices in sufficient volumes 
we depend on a limited number of customers  and any decrease in revenue or cash flows from any one of our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 
a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
our top five customers accounted for of net revenues during the fiscal year ended march  and of net revenues during the fiscal year ended march  additionally  we are also subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of our accounts receivable 
the loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
this risk is increased due to the potential for some of these customers to exit the markets served by us  or to enter into a business combination with one of our competitors 
additionally  some of these customers are based in the pacific rim region  which is subject to economic and political uncertainties 
our customers generally order products through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from us for any extended period 
major customers also have significant leverage over us and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing and payment terms  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
this risk is increased due to the potential for some of these customers to merge with or acquire one or more of our other customers 
as our oem customers are pressured to reduce prices as a result of competitive factors  we may be required to contractually commit to price reductions for our products before we know how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
if we are unable to achieve such cost reductions  our gross margins could decline and such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our business may be subject to seasonal fluctuations and uneven sales patterns in the future 
many of our oem customers experience seasonality and uneven sales patterns in their businesses 
for example  some of our customers close a disproportionate percentage of their sales transactions in the last month  weeks and days of each quarter  and other customers experience spikes in sales during the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
since a large percentage of our products are sold to oem customers who experience seasonal fluctuations and uneven sales patterns in their businesses  we could continue to experience similar seasonality and uneven sales patterns 
in addition  as our business model moves to a hub model in which our customers increasingly require us to maintain products at hub locations near our customer facilities  it becomes easier for our customers to order products with very short lead times  and as a result makes it increasingly difficult for us to predict sales trends 
in addition  our quarterly fiscal periods often do not correspond with the fiscal quarters of our customers  and this may result in uneven sales patterns between quarters 
it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which the seasonality and uneven sales patterns of our oem customers may affect our business in the future because the historical growth of our business may have lessened the effect of this seasonality and uneven sales patterns on our business in the past 

table of contents competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  price erosion  rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards

in the enclosure management sector  we compete primarily with vitesse semiconductor corporation and hitachi  ltd 
we may compete with some of our larger disk drive and computer systems customers  some of which have the capability to develop integrated circuits for use in their own products 
at least one large oem customer in the past decided to vertically integrate and therefore stopped purchasing products from us 
we need to continue to develop products appropriate to our markets to remain competitive as our competitors continue to introduce products with improved performance characteristics 
while we continue to devote significant resources to research and development  these efforts may not be successful or competitive products may not be developed and introduced in a timely manner 
further  several of our competitors have greater resources devoted to securing semiconductor foundry capacity because of long term agreements regarding supply flow  equity or financing agreements or direct ownership of a foundry 
in addition  while relatively few competitors offer a full range of san products  additional domestic and foreign manufacturers may increase their presence in these markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors 
if we are unable to design  develop or introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  our future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
we expect the pricing of our products to continue to decline  which could reduce our revenues  gross margins  and profitability 
we expect the average unit prices of our products on a product to product comparison basis to decline in the future as a result of competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or other factors 
if we are unable to offset these factors by increasing sales volumes  or reducing product manufacturing cost  our total revenues and gross margins may decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins we must maintain or increase current shipment volumes  develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  and we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
moreover  most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of receipt of corresponding revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to decrease our spending to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
if this occurs  our operating results and gross margins may be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and stock market analysts  and our stock price could be negatively affected 
our distributors may not adequately distribute our products and their reseller customers may purchase products from our competitors  which could negatively affect our operations 
our distributors generally offer a diverse array of products from several different manufacturers and suppliers 
accordingly  we are at risk that these distributors may give higher priority to selling products from other suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell our products 
a reduction in sales efforts by our current distributors could materially adversely impact our business or operating results 
in addition  if we decrease our distributor incentive programs ie  competitive pricing and rebates  our distributors may temporarily decrease the amounts of product purchased from us 
this could result in a change of business habits  and distributors may decide to decrease the amount of product held and reduce their inventory levels  which could impact availability of our products to their customers 
as a result of the aforementioned factors regarding our distributors or other unrelated factors  the reseller customers of our distributors could decide to purchase products developed and manufactured by our 
table of contents competitors 
any loss of demand for our products by value added resellers and system integrators could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
we depend on our relationships with silicon chip suppliers and other subcontractors  and a loss of any of these relationships may lead to unpredictable consequences that may harm our results of operations if alternative supply sources are not available 
we currently rely on multiple foundries to manufacture our semiconductor products either in finished form or wafer form 
we generally conduct business with our foundries through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts 
therefore  these foundries are generally not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
if a foundry terminates its relationship with us or if our supply from a foundry is otherwise interrupted  we may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
as a result  we may not be able to meet customer demands  which would harm our business 
historically  there have been periods when there has been a worldwide shortage of advanced process technology foundry capacity 
the manufacture of semiconductor devices is subject to a wide variety of factors  including the availability of raw materials  the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used and the performance of personnel and equipment 
we are continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries have in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
new supply sources may not be able or willing to satisfy our silicon chip requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or unit prices 
we have not developed alternate sources of supply for our products 
for example  our integrated single chip fibre channel controller is manufactured by lsi logic and integrates lsi logic s transceiver technology 
in the event that lsi logic is unable or unwilling to satisfy our requirements for this technology  our marketing efforts related to fibre channel products would be delayed and  as such  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the requirement that a customer perform additional product qualifications  or a customer s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of products from us  may cause that customer to satisfy its product requirements from our competitors 
constraints or delays in the supply of our products  due to capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at our foundries or with our subcontractors  delays in obtaining additional production at the existing foundries or in obtaining production from new foundries  shortages of raw materials or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers 
our products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could lead to an increase in our costs  reduce our net revenues or damage our reputation 
our products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as newer versions are released 
we are also exposed to risks associated with latent defects in existing products 
from time to time  we have found errors in existing  new or enhanced products 
the occurrence of hardware or software errors could adversely affect the sales of our products  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
the migration of our customers toward new products may result in fluctuations of our operating results 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize the effects of product inventories that may become excess and obsolete  as well as ensure that sufficient supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demands 
our failure to manage the transition to newer products in the future or to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements could adversely affect our business or financial results 
when we introduce new products and product enhancements  we face risks relating to product transitions  including risks relating to 
table of contents forecasting demand  as well as possible product and software defects 
if any of these factors were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
historically  the electronics industry has developed higher performance application specific integrated circuits  or asics  which create chip level solutions that replace selected board level or box level solutions at a significantly lower average selling price 
we have previously offered asics to customers for certain applications that have effectively resulted in a lower priced solution when compared to an hba solution 
this transition to asics may also occur with respect to other current and future products 
the result of this transition may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the future  a similar adverse effect to our business could occur if there were rapid shifts in customer purchases from our midrange server and storage solutions to products for the small and medium sized business market 
terrorist activities and resulting military actions could adversely affect our business 
terrorist attacks have disrupted commerce throughout the united states and europe 
the continued threat of terrorism within the united states  europe and the pacific rim  and the military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat  may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  interruptions or delays in our receipt of products from our suppliers  delays in collecting cash  a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any long term material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because we depend on foreign customers and suppliers  we are subject to international economic  regulatory  political and other risks that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
export revenues accounted for of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  we expect that export revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to several risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering and managing our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements  such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  potentially longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability  and general trade restrictions 
a significant number of our customers and suppliers are located in pacific rim countries 
historically  the asian markets have suffered from economic uncertainty 
this uncertainty has taken place especially in countries that have had a collapse in both their currency and stock markets 
these economic pressures have reduced liquidity in the banking systems of the affected countries and  when coupled with excess industrial production capacity  could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
our export sales are invoiced in us dollars and  accordingly  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products 
table of contents to such foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may need to enter into agreements to guarantee that we have production capacity  which may require the expenditure of substantial funds 
the semiconductor industry has  in the past  experienced shortages of available foundry capacity 
accordingly  in order to secure an adequate supply of silicon chips  we may consider various possible supply agreements 
these agreements include the use of take or pay contracts  making equity investments in  or advances to  silicon chip manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct foundries or to develop certain products 
any of these arrangements would involve financial risk to us and could require us to commit a substantial amount of our funds or provide technology licenses in return for guaranteed production capacity 
the need to commit our own funds may require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale or issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
this kind of additional financing  if necessary  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may engage in mergers  acquisitions and strategic investments and these activities may adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
our future growth may depend in part on our ability to identify and acquire complementary businesses  technologies or product lines that are compatible with ours 
mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks  including uncertainties in identifying and pursuing target companies  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which we have no or limited direct prior experience  the potential loss of current customers or failure to retain the acquired company s customers  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
further  we may never realize the perceived benefits of a business combination 
future acquisitions by us could dilute stockholders investment and cause us to incur debt  contingent liabilities and amortization impairment charges related to intangible assets  all of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
we have made  and could make in the future  investments in technology companies  including privately held companies in a development stage 
many of these private equity investments are inherently risky because the companies businesses may never develop  and we may incur losses related to these investments 
in addition  we may be required to write down the carrying value of these investments to reflect other than temporary declines in their value  which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with strategic alliances 
we have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents there can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances  some of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than us  will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future  discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors 
rapid growth may strain our operations and require that we incur costs to upgrade our infrastructure 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion 
our rapid growth and expansion has placed  and continues to place  a strain on our resources 
unless we manage this growth and future growth effectively  we may encounter challenges in executing our business  such as sales forecasting  material planning and inventory management  which may result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
in addition  we test most of our products prior to shipment 
if our capacity to conduct this testing does not expand concurrently with the anticipated growth of our business  product shipments could be delayed  which could result in delayed or lost revenues and customer dissatisfaction 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our future success largely depends on our key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software developers 
if we lose the services of key personnel or fail to hire personnel for key positions  our business would be adversely affected 
we believe that the market for key personnel in the industries in which we compete is highly competitive 
in particular  periodically we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified engineers and other technical personnel and anticipate that competition for such personnel will increase in the future 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to develop new products in the future or to manage our business  both in the united states and abroad 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and current and future infringement claims or adverse judgments could harm our competitive position 
although we have patent protection on certain aspects of our technology in some jurisdictions  we rely primarily on trade secrets  copyrights and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that we can maintain such technology as trade secrets 
there also can be no assurance that any patents we possess will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or at all 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our business would be negatively impacted 
we have received notices of claimed infringement of intellectual property rights in the past 
in addition  we are currently engaged in litigation with parties who claim we have infringed on their intellectual property rights 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert additional claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us with respect to existing and future products 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and the necessary licenses or similar arrangements may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
in addition  if we litigate these kinds of claims  the litigation could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from other matters 
our business could suffer regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
our supply of silicon chips and other components can also be interrupted by intellectual property infringement claims against our suppliers 

table of contents changes in income tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
additionally  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
however  there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees  and proposed changes in accounting for equity compensation could adversely affect earnings 
we have historically used stock options and other forms of equity related compensation as key components of our total rewards employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
in recent periods  many of our employee stock options have had exercise prices in excess of our stock price  which could affect our ability to retain or attract present and prospective employees 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board and other agencies have proposed  and are currently considering  changes to united states generally accepted accounting principles that would require us and other companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives 
moreover  applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant options to employees in the future  which may result in changes in our equity compensation strategy 
these and other developments in the provision of equity compensation to employees could make it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees and result in additional expense to us 
our charter document and stockholder rights plan may discourage companies from acquiring us and offering our stockholders a premium for their stock 
pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors is authorized to approve the issuance of shares of currently undesignated preferred stock without any vote or future action by the stockholders 
pursuant to this authority  in june  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of a right to purchase preferred stock for each outstanding share of our common stock 
after adjustment for stock splits  our common stock now carries one eighth of a preferred stock purchase right per share 
the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our stock 
this may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
our corporate headquarters and principal design facilities are located in a region that is subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  our principal design facilities and our critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults 
we are not specifically insured for earthquakes  or other such natural disasters 
any personal injury or damage to the facilities as a result of such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a marketable securities investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
in accordance with our investment guidelines  we only invest in instruments with high credit quality standards and we limit our credit exposure to any one issuer or type of investment 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
