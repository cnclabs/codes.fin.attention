the better beer category is highly competitive due to the recent gains in market share achieved by imported beers and the large number of regional craft and specialty brewers  with similar pricing and target consumers 
the company believes that this pricing is appropriate given the quality and reputation of its core brands  while realizing that economic pricing pressures may affect future pricing levels 
certain major domestic brewers have also developed niche brands to compete within the better beer category and have acquired interests in craft beers or importation rights to foreign brands 
import brewers and major domestic brewers are able to compete more aggressively than is the company  as they have substantially greater resources  marketing strength and distribution networks than the company 
although the domestic craft beer industry has recently experienced some consolidation  the company anticipates competition to remain strong as brewers retrench and focus their marketing efforts on their key local markets and core brands 
this competitive environment may affect the company s overall performance within the better beer category 
as the market matures and the better beer category continues to consolidate  the company believes that companies that are well positioned in terms of brand equity  marketing and distribution will have greater success than those who do not 
with approximately distributors nationwide and the 
table of contents company s approximately salespeople  a commitment to maintaining brand equity  and the quality of its beer  the company believes it is well positioned to compete in a maturing market 
the company operates with the strategy of both contract brewing  which utilizes the excess capacity of other breweries  and brewing at its own breweries 
this strategy provides the company with flexibility in addition to quality and cost advantages 
the company follows firm policies and procedures in selecting the appropriate brewery and monitoring the production process in order to ensure that quality and control standards are attained 
as part of this strategy  the company owns a brewery in cincinnati  ohio 
in  the company brewed nearly half of the company s products at the cincinnati brewery and the remainder at non company owned contract breweries 
the company believes that it will have adequate capacity for the production of its products for the foreseeable future  although the volumes at different contract breweries may change 
the economics of this capacity may change as supply and demand for contract capacity changes 
as the economics and availability of contract brewing capacity changes over time  the company will continually evaluate the tradeoff between brewery ownership and contract brewing

the demand for the company s products is subject to changes in consumers tastes 
a change in consumer tastes or in the demand for better beer products may affect the company s future results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
in response to a recent trend towards low carbohydrate diets  certain domestic brewers have also introduced and re positioned beers that are low in carbohydrates  impacting the market share of certain beer products within the industry 
the potential impact of known facts  commitments  events and uncertainties brewery related transactions in  miller brewing company filed with the american arbitration association a demand for arbitration with respect to its right to terminate its obligation to produce certain of the company s products under a contract brewing agreement prior to the expiration of the term of the agreement 
in the fourth quarter  the arbitrators issued their decision that miller was not entitled to early termination of its production agreement with the company 
with the resolution of the dispute with miller  contract brewing arrangements with other breweries and productions at the cincinnati brewery  the company continues to expect that it will have sources of supply adequate to meet the expected demand for the company s products for the next several years 
hops purchase commitments the company utilizes several varieties of hops in the production of its products 
to ensure adequate supplies of these varieties  the company enters into advance multi year purchase commitments based on forecasted future hops requirements  among other factors 
during  the company entered into several hops future contracts in the normal course of business 
the total value of the contracts entered into as of december   which are denominated in euros  was million 
the company has no forward exchange contracts in place as of december  and currently intends to purchase future hops using the exchange rate at the time of purchase 
the contract agreements were deemed necessary in order to bring hops inventory levels and future contracts into balance with the company s current brewing volume and hops usage forecasts 
in addition  these new contracts enabled the company to secure its position for future supply with hops vendors in the face of some competitive buying activity 
the computation of the excess inventory and purchase commitment reserve required management to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth  product mix  cancellation costs and supply  among others 
actual results may materially differ from management s estimates 
the company continues to manage inventory levels and purchase commitments in an effort to maximize utilization of hops on hand and hops under commitment 
the company s accounting policy for hops inventory and purchase commitments is to recognize a loss by establishing a reserve to the extent inventory levels and 
table of contents commitments exceed forecasted needs as well as aged hops as determined by the company s brewing department 
the company will continue to manage hops inventory and contract levels 
the current levels are deemed adequate  based upon foreseeable future brewing requirements 
however  changes in management s assumptions regarding future sales growth  product mix  and hops market conditions could result in future material losses 
contractual obligations the following table presents contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands advertising commitments hops purchase commitments operating leases total contractual obligations the company s outstanding purchase commitments related to advertising contracts of approximately million at december  reflect amounts that are non cancelable

these purchase contracts  which extend through crop year  specify both the quantities and prices  denominated in euros  to which the company is committed 
amounts included in the above table are in united states dollars using the exchange rate as of december  the company does not have any forward currency contracts in place and currently intends to purchase the committed hops in euros using the exchange rate at the time of purchase 
purchases under these contracts for the year ended december  was approximately million 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into various production agreements with brewing companies 
title to beer products brewed under contract arrangement remains with the brewing company until the producing brewery ships the beer 
the company is required to reimburse the supplier for all unused raw materials and beer products on termination of these production contract agreements 
there were approximately million of raw materials and beer products in process at the contract brewers for which the company was liable as of each of the years ended december  and december  additionally  the company is obligated to meet annual volume requirements in conjunction with certain production agreements 
during  the company met all existing minimum volume requirements in accordance with its production agreements  with the exception of one brewery location 
the fees associated with this minimum volume requirement were not significant  and have been fully expensed in the company s financial statements at december  the company s agreements with its contract breweries periodically require the company to purchase fixed assets in support of brewery operations 
at this time  there are no specific fixed asset purchases anticipated under existing contracts during the next twelve months  but this could vary significantly should there be a change in the company s brewing strategy or changes to existing production agreements or should the company enter new production relationships or introduce new products

table of contents other risks and uncertainties changes in general economic conditions could result in numerous events that may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
numerous factors that could adversely affect the company s operating income  cash flows and financial position  include  but are not limited to  a slowing of the growth rate of the better beer category  share of market erosion of samuel adams boston lager  sam adams light and its seasonal beers due to increased competition  an unexpected decline in the brewing capacity available to the company  increased advertising and promotional expenditures that are not followed by higher sales volume  higher than planned costs of operating the cincinnati brewery  higher than planned costs of operating under contract arrangement at non company owned breweries  increased freight costs resulting from changes in legislation  changes in fuel costs  or changes in the locations of available breweries  changes in economics and feasibility of using recycled glass  adverse fluctuations in raw material or packaging costs which cannot be passed along through increased prices  world hops market conditions affecting the company s ability to buy or sell hops or cancel excess hops commitments  poor weather conditions  resulting in an inadequate supply of raw materials that are agriculturally grown  particularly the united states and canadian barley crop  which if poor  would result in significantly increased barley costs and therefore barley malt costs  adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in control or ownership of the current distribution network which leads to less support of the company s products  increases in the costs of distribution  and increases in the costs associated with packaging materials due to uncontrollable changes in the bottle redemption process  increases in federal and or state beer excise tax  introduction of new products by competitors that compete directly with the company s products  or that diminish the importance of the company s products to the retailers or distributors  further limitations on advertising  changes in consumer tastes  including a recent trend towards low carbohydrate diets 
the company continues to brew its samuel adams boston lager at each of its brewing facilities  but at any particular time may rely on only one supplier for its products other than samuel adams boston lager 
the company believes that it has sufficient capacity options that would allow for a shift in production locations if necessary  although it is unable to quantify any additional costs  capital or operating  if any  that it might incur in securing access to such capacity 
in the event of a labor dispute  governmental action  a sudden closure of one of the contract breweries or other events that would prevent either the cincinnati brewery or any of the contract breweries from producing the company s beer  management believes that it would be able to shift production between breweries so as to meet demand for its beer 
in such event  however  the company could experience temporary shortfalls in production and or increased production or distribution costs  the combination of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
as the number of available contract breweries declines  the risks of the above disruption increases  and the structure of the brewery strategy of ownership versus contracting changes 
the company continually evaluates these factors and others in its evaluation of ownership versus contracting 
historically  the company has not experienced material difficulties in obtaining timely delivery from its suppliers 
although the company believes that there are alternate sources available for the ingredients and packaging materials  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to acquire such ingredients or packaging materials from substitute sources on a timely or cost effective basis in the event that current suppliers could not adequately fulfill orders 
the loss of a supplier could  in the short term  adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
hops and malt are agricultural products and therefore many outside factors  including weather conditions  crop production  government regulations and legislation affecting agriculture  could affect both price and supply
