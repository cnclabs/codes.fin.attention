the company reports all its revenues in one reportable business segment  the strategic asset management segment 
the company s management assesses operating results on an aggregate basis to make decisions about the allocation of resources 
our actual results are reported in united states dollars 
international revenues accounted for of total revenues for fiscal year and therefore the fluctuation in exchange rates can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in fiscal  the fluctuation in the euro dollar and the british pound  in particular  had a favorable impact on our revenue results 
we assess the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our business by recalculating the current period s financial results using the comparable period s exchange rates to devise a constant currency rate in order to compare period over period results 
total actual revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  however  in constant currency terms the increase is estimated to be 
the exchange rates had a similar impact on direct and operating expenses and therefore  the overall impact on net income was immaterial for fiscal year in july  the company completed the acquisition of raptor asa corporation  a provider of software solutions for the aviation industry 
the raptor technology will be integrated into the company s next generation of products  maximo enterprise suite mxes 
the total purchase price of the acquisition was million 
the amount of thousand was paid at closing 
the amount of thousand is payable within thirty days after the first anniversary of the closing and thousand is payable within thirty days after the second anniversary of the closing 
both of these future payments are contingent upon the completion of knowledge transfer milestones  however  neither payment is contingent on any employment of the selling principals with the company 
the company allocated the purchase price as such thousand to acquired technology  thousand to goodwill and thousand to deferred tax liability 
the deferred tax liability page represents the cumulative tax effect of the book to tax difference in basis for the acquired technology 
the acquired technology will be amortized over five years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  in which different judgments and estimates by our management could materially affect our reported condition and results of operations  include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  and the valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition software products the company primarily licenses its software products under noncancellable license agreements 
software license fee revenues are generally recognized upon contract execution and product shipment  provided that collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable  the fees are fixed or determinable  and no significant modification or customization of the software is required 
our customers do not have any right of return except as stipulated under a standard day warranty that runs concurrent with post contract support pcs 
the company does not maintain any reserves with respect to this warranty based on a history of performance of our software 
on the rare occasion that a customer insists on conditions of acceptance  the company defers revenue until the customer s acceptance is obtained and the condition has been satisfied 
revenue from products sold through indirect channels resellers is recognized upon shipment of the software  as long as evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility is probable and the fee is fixed or determinable and the reseller s obligation to pay us is not contingent upon resale of our product 
revenue is recorded net of any commissions or discounts payable to these resellers 
our resellers do not have any right of return beyond the standard day performance warranty that runs concurrent with pcs 
services revenues services revenues are comprised of consulting and training fees related to installation of the company s software solutions  maintenance support pcs contracts for software products  and subscription based fees related to the company s ocs business 
consulting and training services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
pcs revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  generally one year 
customers typically subscribe to ocs on an annual basis and revenue is recorded as services revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the applicable subscription period 
many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting contracts 
we consider whether the services revenue can be recognized separately from the software revenue by analyzing the nature of the services ie if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  the level of risk  availability of services from other vendors  acceptance criteria  milestone payments and fixed price terms 
for those contracts that contain fixed price arrangements  if we can reliably estimate the hours required to complete the implementation services and if we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for page the fair value of the hourly rates for consultants  we recognize the software license fee separately from the services revenues 
the services revenues are recognized as they are delivered and the related costs as they are incurred 
if at any point in time the costs exceed revenues  we immediately accrue for estimated losses using cost estimates that are based on average fully burdened daily rates applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
for those fixed price arrangements where we cannot reliably estimate the hours required to complete the implementation services and we do not have vsoe for the fair value of the hourly rates for consultants  the software license value is recognized together with the consulting services over the period the consulting services are provided 
multiple element arrangements the company s multiple element arrangements could include the following three elements a software license  b pcs  and c consulting  training and other services services 
revenue is allocated to the elements of the arrangement based upon the vsoe of fair value of each element 
the company uses the residual method to recognize its software license revenue  because while we are able to determine the vsoe of fair value of pcs and services  we are unable to determine the fair value of software licenses 
under the residual method  the fair value of undelivered elements pcs and or services is deferred and recognized when the pcs and or services are delivered 
the difference between the amount of the total arrangement and the amount attributable to the elements for which fair value is determinable pcs and or services is recognized as software license revenue 
vsoe is established for pcs and is based on the price of pcs when sold separately 
the pcs renewal rate is a relatively consistent percentage of the stipulated software license fee  offered to all customers 
vsoe for consulting services is based on fixed hourly rates set according to the skill level of the consultant required 
vsoe for training services is based on an established per student fee structure 
for those multi element arrangements  where we cannot establish vsoe for the undelivered elements  the software license value is recognized together with the consulting services over the period the consulting services are provided 
contract accounting is applied to any arrangement that includes significant customization or modification of the software 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net days 
payment terms that extend beyond net days from the contract date but are within twelve months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful history of collecting on such arrangements 
for those customers who are deemed not to be credit worthy  revenue is deferred until payment is received 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts  which reflect the company s estimate of the amounts owed by customers that customers will be unable or otherwise fail to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts and factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and limits the amount of credit when deemed necessary 
the company believes that the current estimate of allowances for doubtful accounts recorded as of september  adequately covers any potential credit risks 
however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates and their payment defaults exceed our estimates  then we may need to increase our allowance reserves  which will result in a charge to income in the period that the adjustment is made 
the company did not record a provision for estimated sales returns 
based on our history of sales returns and an analysis of credit memos  we determined that a provision was not needed 
if the historical data we used to calculate the basis for a provision does not properly reflect future returns  then a provision for returns will be recorded  and a charge to income will result  in the period that such a determination is made 
page income taxes deferred income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board no 
the company computes deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  the expected tax benefit of operating loss carryforwards and the expected benefit of tax credit carryforwards 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes 
the company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax asset 
the deferred tax asset may be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
the company believes future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
in the event that it is determined that our financial projections change and it becomes more likely than not that we cannot realize the net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets will be made and will result in a charge to income in the period such a determination is made 
the net deferred tax asset amount as of september  is million 
the company has established a valuation allowance with respect to various net operating losses assumed from acquisitions 
the valuation allowance was based upon expected earnings within individual tax jurisdictions and statutory limitations imposed by tax jurisdictions  which will more likely than not reduce our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards 
the reduction in the net valuation allowance in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to the utilization of previously unbenefited losses 
tax contingencies tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimate of the value of our tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company reviews its long lived assets  with the exception of goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair value 
the company estimates whether future cash flows expected to result from the use of assets exceed the carrying amount of the assets 
in the event that the company judges that an impairment exists  all or a portion of the asset will be written off based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in order to determine the fair value  the company obtains quoted market prices or utilizes valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
the company also periodically assesses the useful life of its fixed assets and may in the future need to adjust the life of an asset or write it off 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the net tangible and intangible assets in a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value  a detailed impairment loss analysis would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment  if any

the factors which might impact the company s cash flows include those which might impact the company s business and operations generally  as described below under the heading factors affecting future performance 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca contains a series of provisions several of which are pertinent to the company 
the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
it has been the company s practice to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings into its foreign operations and the company currently still plans to continue to reinvest its foreign earnings permanently into its foreign operations 
should the company determine that it plans to repatriate any of its foreign earnings  the company will be required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings 
the ajca eliminates the extraterritorial income exclusion for transactions occurring after december  however  the ajca provides transitional relief  allowing an exclusion of of the exclusion previously allowable for transactions occurring in calendar and for transactions occurring in calendar the ajca also provides us corporations with an income tax deduction equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic production activities qualified activities 
the deduction  which cannot exceed of annual wages paid  is phased in as follows of qualified activities of the company s fiscal years and  in fiscal years through  and in fiscal year and thereafter 
the company believes that it qualifies for the deduction 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued a staff position fas a indicating that the domestic manufacturing deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction 
as such  the tax benefit of the deduction will be accounted for in the periods in which the qualifying activities occur  ie  the years in which the deductions are taken on the company s tax returns 
this benefit will be included in the company s annual effective tax rate  but will not result in a re measurement of deferred income taxes 
the ajca may have an impact on the company s tax rate for and future years 
the outcome at this time is not yet known 
page factors affecting future performance the nature of forward looking information is that such information involves significant assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
certain public documents of the company and statements made by our authorized officers  directors  employees  agents and representatives  acting on behalf of the company  may include forward looking information  which will be influenced by the factors described below  and by other assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
forward looking information is based on assumptions  estimates  forecasts and projections regarding the company s future results as well as the future effectiveness of the company s strategic plans and its operational decisions 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company are subject to the risk that the forecasts  projections  and expectations of management  or assumptions underlying such forecasts  projections and expectations  may prove to be inaccurate 
accordingly  actual results and the company s implementation of its plans and operations may differ materially from forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the following discussion identifies certain important factors that could affect the company s actual results and actions and could cause such results and actions to differ materially from forward looking statements 
we depend substantially on our maximo eam product most of our revenues are derived from the licensing of our maximo eam family of products and sales of related services and support 
our financial performance depends largely on continued market acceptance of these products 
we believe that continued market acceptance and our revenue stability and growth will largely depend on our ability to continue to enhance and broaden the capabilities of these products 
if we are unable to continue to enhance and improve maximo eam so that it delivers the capabilities required by existing and potential customers and remains competitive with other products in the market  or if a trend emerges such that customers decide to consolidate their it systems and eliminate their standalone of best of breed eam application software altogether  our revenues  margins and results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
the traditional market for our maximo eam product is mature and saturated and presents limited opportunity for growth 
maximo has been the industry leading plant floor capital asset maintenance product for a number of years  and we have acquired a large number of customers in this market 
however  most large industrial organizations have made significant investments in systems that support the maintenance of their capital assets  and opportunities for new maximo sales in the eam market are in a state of continuous decline 
in addition  the emergence and growth of this market have attracted a large number of competitors  and most of the largest software companies that sell into complementary markets have developed competing asset maintenance products 
it is likely that this market will continue to mature  there will be fewer sales opportunities for the company  and competitive forces will put downward pressure on our average sales prices and rates of success 
to be competitive in the eam market  we have made significant investments in maximo eam to meet the needs of specific industries in which the company has a presence  such as the nuclear  transportation  power generation  transmission and distribution  and other industries 
we refer to these industry specific maximo offerings as industry solutions 
while we continue to strengthen our maximo eam offering  these efforts may not be sufficient to overcome the effects of maturity and saturation in our traditional market  and our revenues  margins  results of operation and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our efforts to reach into new markets with new products may not be successful 
given the maturity and saturation of the traditional eam market  in order to maintain revenues at their current levels and to grow our business  we are attempting to broaden our product offerings and find additional sources of revenues 
we are attempting  through acquisitions and internal development  to deliver products that address markets that are new to the company  such as the itam and help and service desk markets 
the culmination of these efforts will be embodied in maximo enterprise suite mxes  which is scheduled for release in early calendar page our development of mxes and of our maximo eam industry solutions  and our ability to derive revenue and grow the company  is subject to the following risks  among others we may not be able to develop and market our new products including mxes on time  with acceptable quality or with functions and features that meet the requirements of customers in these markets 
current potential customers who are considering the purchase of our maximo eam or maximo itam products may decide to postpone their purchase in anticipation of the release of mxes 
the mxes help and service desk products may not contain all of the functionality deemed necessary by prospective buyers in these markets 
it is possible that the company s sales  service or support personnel may not be adequately trained and or staffed to sell  implement or support the new products 
newly developed products require a higher level of development  distribution and support expenditures in the early stages of their product lifecycles 
in the event that our development efforts are not progressing as intended  or if our new product releases or technologies are not successful in the markets they are intended to address  we may increase our rate of expenditure in this area over and above the level of investment experienced in the past or previously projected  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operation or financial condition 
the launch of mxes may not result in any new revenues while serving as a major distraction from our efforts to maintain revenues at current levels in our traditional eam market 
we are positioning the combination of our traditional eam functionality with the new itam and help and service desk in a single offering as a logical suite of software products  which may enable our customers to consolidate their information technology it systems 
our customers may not value this combination of products in a single architecture  or they may believe that other overlapping and proven suites are more desirable  or that the intrinsic value of having a broad suite of developed products does not outweigh the functional advantages offered by existing and experienced best of breed vendors in any one of the markets viewed separately  especially the itam and help and service desk markets where our offering is new and unproven 
if any of our newly developed products do not gain market acceptance and generate revenues from new industries or markets  we may not be able to grow our business or maintain revenues at current levels  and our revenues  margins  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to keep pace with the rapid changes in technology and customer demand that characterize our industry  our competitive position could be impaired 
the computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements by us and by our competitors 
our success depends on our abilities to enhance our current products  to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  to respond to evolving customer requirements and changing industry standards  to offer functionality and other innovations that are unique to our products and superior to those of our competitors  and ultimately to achieve market acceptance 
in particular  we believe that we must continue to innovate and develop new functionality  to respond quickly to users needs for new functionality and to advances in hardware and operating systems  and that we must continue to create products that conform to industry standards regarding the communication and interoperability among software  hardware and communications products of many different vendors 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and changes in market definitions or changes in customer requirements within particular market segments  or if we have any page significant delays in product development or introduction  then we could lose competitiveness and revenues 
our sales efforts depend in part on strategic relationships with other companies 
we have entered into strategic relationships with various larger companies  such as hp  ibm  saic and others 
in order to generate revenue through these relationships  each party must coordinate with and support the other s sales and marketing efforts  and each party must make significant sales and marketing investments 
our ability to generate revenues through these relationships depends in large part upon the efforts of these other companies  which are outside of our control 
the efforts of these companies may in turn be influenced by factors internal to these companies  or by developments in their respective industries or markets  that we fail to anticipate 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and to seasonal variation 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  significant period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
in addition  our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated historically due to the number and timing of product introductions and enhancements  customers delaying their purchasing decisions in anticipation of new product releases  the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers  the timing of product shipments and the timing of marketing and product development expenditures 
we typically realize a significant portion of our revenue from sales of software licenses in the last two weeks of each quarter  frequently even in the last few days of a quarter 
failure to close a small number of large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for the quarter and could  therefore  result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results  and divergence of those results from our expectations 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we face intense competition in the markets we serve 
the markets for strategic asset management software such as maximo eam  maximo itam and maximo enterprise suite mxes are fragmented by geography  by market and industry segments  by hardware platform and by industry orientation  and are characterized by a large number of competitors including both independent software vendors and certain erp vendors 
independent software vendors include datastream systems  inc and indus international  inc 
we also compete with integrated erp systems  which include integrated maintenance modules offered by several large vendors  such as sap  oracle  and others 
in the itam market we compete with companies such as peregrine systems  computer associates and bmc software 
mxes will compete with all of these companies  plus additional companies in the help and service desk markets  such as hp 
maximo also encounters competition from vendors of low cost maintenance management systems designed initially for use by a single user or limited number of users as vendors of these products upgrade their functionality and performance to enter the enterprise market 
certain of our competitors have greater financial  marketing  service and support and technological resources than we do 
to the extent that such competitors increase their focus on the asset maintenance or planning and cost systems markets  or on the industrial supply chain market  we could be at a competitive disadvantage 
current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions thereby increasing their ability to deliver products that better address the needs of our customers 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully should this occur and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our international operations subject us to special risks 
a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses are derived and incurred from operations outside the us our ability to sell our products internationally is subject to a number of risks 
general economic and political conditions in each page country could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
exposure to currency fluctuations and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable could affect our sales 
we could be affected by the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign import laws  us export laws and regulatory requirements 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and increase our operating costs 
our software products are dependent on third party providers of software and services  and failure of these parties to perform as expected  or termination of our relationships with them  could harm our business 
we have entered into nonexclusive license agreements with other software vendors  pursuant to which we incorporate into our products and solutions software providing certain application development  hardware and network discovery  user interface  mobile technology  report writing  application servers  business intelligence  content and graphics capabilities developed by these companies 
if we cannot renew these licenses at all or on commercially reasonable terms  or if any of such vendors were to become unable to support and enhance their products  we could be required to devote additional resources to the enhancement and support of these products or to acquire or develop software providing equivalent capabilities  which could cause delays in the development and introduction of products incorporating such capabilities 
we may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
we are subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  there could be a material and adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
changes in regulations or critical accounting policies could materially and adversely affect us 
new laws  regulations or standards related to the company or our products  and new accounting pronouncements  could be implemented or changed in a manner that could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company may be eligible for several tax benefits provided for under the american jobs creation act of  which was signed into law on october  the potential tax benefits include a temporary foreign dividends received deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations 
there are several statutory requirements  which must be met if the company determines that the dividends received deduction is advantageous 
however  if the company does not appropriately comply with the statutory requirements then the foreign dividends received deduction could be forfeited resulting in a potentially adverse affect on the results of operations 
we may perform more fixed price services contracts 
a trend has emerged and is continuing among customers in our market towards demanding consulting and implementation services on a fixed price basis  whereby the company agrees to deliver the contract requirements for a fixed fee  regardless of the number of person hours actually provided  as opposed to our traditional services arrangements where we deliver services on a time and materials basis 
in cases where services are provided either for the future delivery of functionality or on a fixed price basis and our standard software is licensed at the same time  and if the services are essential to the overall solution desired by the customer or if the company cannot determine the fair value of the services being delivered  then the company may not be able to recognize the software license revenue from such page transactions at the time the agreements are signed  but rather may be required to recognize such license revenue under the contract method of accounting  or to recognize a greater portion or all of the revenue from these transactions as services revenue 
this would likely result in a postponement of recognition of  or even a reduction in  software license revenues  and have an adverse affect on the results of our operations 
we may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual property 
our success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
we currently have two us patents and other corresponding patents or applications pending in various foreign countries  and we protect our technology primarily through copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements 
our software products are sometimes licensed to customers under shrink wrap or click wrap licenses included as part of the product packaging or acknowledged by customers who register online 
although  in larger sales  our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses may be accompanied by specifically negotiated agreements signed by the licensee  in many cases our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees 
certain provisions of our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  including provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program  and limitations or liabilities and exclusions of remedies  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us finally  we sell our products through distributors and resellers  and are therefore dependent on those companies to take appropriate steps to adequately implement our contractual protections and to enforce and protect our rights 
we cannot give any assurance that the steps that we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or development by others of similar technology 
although we believe that our products and technology do not infringe on any valid claim of any patent or any other proprietary rights of others  we cannot give any assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  could result in the deterioration or outright loss of our patent rights  copyrights or other intellectual property  and could potentially have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition 
loss of the services of one or more of our key executive officers or inability to recruit needed sales  services and technical personnel could adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent on certain key executive officers  technical and sales employees  and the loss of one or more of such employees could have an adverse impact on our future operations 
we do not have employment contracts with any personnel  and we do not maintain any so called key person life insurance policies on any personnel 
we continue to hire additional sales  services and technical personnel 
competition for hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and from time to time we may experience difficulty in locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications within the desired geographic locations  or with certain industry specific expertise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 
we invest a significant portion of our cash in marketable securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
economic downturns and other factors subject these securities to volatility in the market place 
as a result  we may recognize the decline in fair value of these investments 
page our stock price has been volatile  and you could incur losses as a result of future fluctuations in our stock price 
there have been significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  recently and over longer time periods 
in addition  the stock market in general has recently experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software and technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  general macroeconomic and market conditions unrelated to our performance may also affect demand for our products and services  our results of operations  and our stock price 
other risks the foregoing is not a complete description of all risks relevant to our future performance  and the foregoing should be read and understood together with and in the context of similar discussions which may be contained in the documents that we file with the sec in the future 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revision to the foregoing or any update to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on its cash equivalents and marketable securities and exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at september   the company held million in cash equivalents and marketable securities consisting of taxable and tax exempt municipal securities 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and limits risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity 
the company develops its products in the united states and markets them in north america  europe  middle east and africa  australia  asia pacific and latin america 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as of september  the company did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
