com and our other web sites  employees are engaged in our intellectual properties division  employees are engaged in our cable tv business  and are corporate  technology and administrative employees 
none of the employees are represented by a labor union  nor have we experienced any work stoppages

risks of investing in our shares investments in our capital stock are speculative and involve a high degree of risk 
investors should carefully consider the following matters  as well as the other information in this form k 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur  our business  results of operations  financial condition  or prospects could be substantially harmed  which would adversely affect your investment 
we have a history of losses and an accumulated deficit 
our operating results could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis 
we have incurred significant losses since we began doing business 
in the years ended december  and we had net losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we may incur additional losses while we continue to grow our businesses 
our future success will depend on the continued growth in our various businesses  and our ability to generate ticketing  licensing  syndication and advertising revenues 
in addition  our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including o seasonal variations in the demand for broadway tickets and resulting variations in our revenue from broadway ticket sales  o our ability to sell advertisements to be displayed on our web sites  o seasonal trends in internet usage and internet sales and advertising placements  o our ability to enter into or renew strategic relationships and agreements with media organizations  web sites and authors  o the amount and timing of our marketing expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of our operations  o new products  web sites or internet services introduced by us or our competitors  and o technical difficulties  security concerns or system downtime affecting the internet generally or the operation of our web sites in particular 
as a result  our operating results for any particular period may not accurately predict our future operating results 
we may not able to compete successfully 
ticketing businesses 
the market for ticketing services and products is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
the number of telephone services  online services  wireless services and web sites competing for consumers attention and spending has proliferated and we expect that competition will continue to intensify 
we compete  directly and indirectly  for customers  advertisers  members and content providers with the following categories of companies o telephone services  wireless services and web sites targeted to entertainment enthusiasts  moviegoers  theatergoers and other eventgoers  which feature directories of movies  shows  events  showtimes  theater and event locations and related content  and also allow users to purchase tickets  o travel agents and other traditional ticketing organizations  companies  agents and brokers  and o the box office at each of the venues that hold events for which we sell tickets 
internet businesses 
the market for internet services and products is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
competition could result in reduced traffic to our web sites  price reductions for content that we syndicate and advertising that we offer  a decline in product sales  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could cause a material decrease in our revenues 
we compete  directly and indirectly  for advertisers  viewers  members and content providers with the following categories of companies o online services or web sites targeted to entertainment enthusiasts  particularly moviegoers and theatergoers  such as imdb 
com  o publishers and distributors of traditional off line media  such as television  radio and print  including those targeted to movie enthusiasts  many of which have established or may establish web sites  such as eonline 
com  o traditional movie and entertainment organizations and vendors or entertainment merchandise and products  including conventional retail stores and catalog retailers  many of which have established web sites  including disney and warner bros  o general purpose consumer online services such as aol  yahoo  and msn  each of which provides access to movie related information and services  and o web search and retrieval and other online services  such as yahoo and other high traffic web sites 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting and retaining users are the depth  breadth and timeliness of content  the ability to offer compelling and entertaining content and brand recognition 
other important factors in attracting and retaining users include ease of use  service quality and cost 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting and retaining advertisers include the number of users of our web site  the demographics of our users  price and the creative implementation of advertisement placements and sponsorship promotions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete favorably with respect to these factors 
based on our review of publicly available documents  we believe some of our existing competitors in both our ticketing and internet businesses  as well as potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and substantially larger user bases than we do and  therefore  have significantly greater ability to attract advertisers and users 
in addition  many of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in internet user requirements and to devote greater resources than us to the development  promotion and sale of their services 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed by us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing internet user preferences 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which would result in a decrease in our revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us would not impair our ability to expand our operations or grow our revenues 
intellectual properties and book development and licensing businesses 
numerous companies and individuals are engaged in the book development business 
we also compete with a large number of companies that license characters and properties into film  television  books and merchandise 
competition in these businesses is largely based on the number and quality of relationships that we are able to develop with authors and celebrities 
there can be no assurance that our current or future competitors will not be successful in developing relationships with authors and celebrities with whom we have previously had relationships 
our revenues will decrease if we are unable to maintain these relationships or develop new relationships 
we may not be able to successfully protect our trademarks and proprietary rights 
internet businesses 
our performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our internally developed and licensed content and technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and with third parties and contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate  or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks  service marks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  effective copyright and trademark protection may be unenforceable or limited in certain foreign countries 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation would be costly and could divert management s attention from other more productive activities 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of certain of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  or prevent us from selling our services 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not bring copyright or trademark infringement claims against us  or claim that our use of certain technology violates a patent 
even if these claims are not meritorious  they could be costly and could divert management s attention from other more productive activities 
if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated a third party s proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that any necessary licenses or rights could be obtained on terms satisfactory to us  if at all 
the inability to obtain any required license on satisfactory terms could force us to incur expenses to change the way we operate our businesses 
if our competitors prepare and file applications that claim trademarks owned or registered by us  we may oppose these applications and have to participate in administrative proceedings to determine priority of right in the trademark  which could result in substantial costs to us  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome could require us to license disputed rights from third parties or to cease using such trademarks 
in addition  inasmuch as we license a portion of our content from third parties  our exposure to copyright infringement or right of privacy or publicity actions may increase  because we must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such licensed content 
we generally obtain representations as to the origins  ownership and right to use such licensed content and generally obtain indemnification to cover any breach of any such representations  however  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for any breach of such representation 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of any litigation between such licensors and a third party or between us and a third party will not lead to royalty obligations for which we are not indemnified or for which such indemnification is insufficient  or that we will be able to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
we own trademark registrations in the united states for many of the trademarks that we use  and some of our trademarks are registered in select foreign countries 
we have also filed trademark applications in the united states and in select foreign countries for the marks hollywood media corp  hollywood 
com  broadway 
com and others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate protection for these names or other trademarks in the united states or in foreign countries 
if we obtain registration of those trademarks  we may not be able to prevent our competitors from using different trademarks that contain the words hollywood or broadway 
many countries have a first to file trademark registration system  and thus we may be prevented from registering our marks in certain countries if third parties have previously filed applications to register or have registered the same or similar marks 
it is possible that our competitors or others will adopt product or service names similar to ours  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possible leading to customer confusion 
our inability to protect our hollywood 
com and broadway 
com marks and other marks adequately could impair our ability to maintain and expand such brands and thus impair our ability to generate revenue from these brands 
intellectual properties business 
hollywood media has applied for trademark and copyright protection for each of its major intellectual property titles 
hollywood media currently has approximately us registered trademarks and three pending trademark applications related to this business  and netco partners currently has six us registered trademarks and three pending trademark applications 
as hollywood media s properties are developed  hollywood media intends to apply for further trademark and copyright protection in the united states and certain foreign countries 
copyright protection in the united states on new publications of works for hire extend for a term of years from the date of initial publication or years from the year of creation  whichever expires first 
trademark registration in the united states extends for a period of ten years following the date of registration 
to maintain the registration  affidavits must be filed between the fifth and sixth years following the registration date affirming that the trademark is still in use in commerce and providing evidence of such use 
the trademark registration must be renewed prior to the expiration of the ten year period following the date of registration 
we must manage our growth in order to achieve the desired results 
we have significantly expanded our data syndication  internet and ticketing operations over the past four years through our acquisitions of the businesses of hollywood 
com  inc  cinemasource  inc  baseline ii  inc  broadwaytheater 
com  inc  theatre direct ny  inc 
and filmtracker  and through the launch of broadway 
com and movietickets 
com hollywood media currently owns of the equity of movietickets 
com  inc 
we plan to continue to expand our operations and market presence by entering into joint ventures  acquisitions  business combinations  investments  or other strategic alliances 
these transactions create risks such as o problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel  o the availability of financing to make acquisitions  o additional expenses of acquired businesses  and o the inability to maintain relationships with the customers or other business partners of acquired businesses 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks if we are not able to adequately develop or increase our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
to the extent that we are unable to identify and successfully integrate future ventures into our operations  our growth strategy may not be successful and our stock price could decrease 
we are dependent on our ability to develop strategic relationships with media  entertainment and internet organizations 
the success of our operations is dependent in part on our ability to enter into and renew strategic relationships and agreements with media  entertainment and internet organizations 
our intellectual property division is dependent on our ability to identify  attract and retain best selling authors and media celebrities who create our intellectual properties 
our business could be harmed by the loss of the services of dr 
martin h 
greenberg  who has been primarily responsible for developing relationships with the best selling authors who create our intellectual properties 
dr 
greenberg owns the remaining interest in tekno books through which we operate our intellectual properties division 
although many of the authors with whom we have relationships are bound to multiple book contracts  our ability to renew these contracts or enter into contracts with new authors would be impaired without the services of dr 
greenberg 
our operations could be negatively impacted by systems interruptions 
the hardware and software used in our internet and ticketing operations  or that of our affiliates  could be damaged by fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
our web sites could also be affected by computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems 
these system problems could affect our business 
insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in systems 
general internet traffic interruptions or delays could also harm our business 
as with internet web sites in general  our web sites may experience slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
additionally  online service providers have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
to the extent our services are disrupted  we could lose users of our web sites and our ticketing and advertising revenues could decline 
we are subject to additional security risks by doing business over the internet 
a significant obstacle to consumer acceptance of electronic commerce over the internet has been the need for secure transmission of confidential information in transaction processing 
internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurred 
we may incur additional costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
if a third person were able to misappropriate our users personal information or credit card information  we could be held liable for failure to adequately protect such information and subject to monetary damages to the extent our users suffer financial losses or other harm as a result thereof 
we may not be able to adapt as technologies and customer expectations continue to evolve 
to be successful  we must adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually enhancing our web sites and ticketing services and introducing new services to address our customers changing expectations 
we must evaluate and implement new technologies that are available in the marketplace or risk that our customers will not continue using our services 
examples of technologies that we continue to implement or evaluate include those related to streaming and downloading of audio and video content on our web sites  delivery of content over wireless devices and the convergence of cable television  satellite and internet services and delivery systems 
we could incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to changes affecting providers of content and services through the internet 
our customer base and thus our revenues could decrease if we cannot adapt to these changes 
government regulation of the internet could impact our business 
the application of existing laws and regulations to our business relating to issues such as user privacy  pricing  taxation  content  sweepstakes  copyrights  trademarks  advertising  and the characteristics and quality of our products and services can be unclear 
we also may be subject to new laws and regulations related to our business 
although we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and believe that we are in compliance  because of the uncertainty of existing laws and the possibility that new laws may be adopted  there is a risk that we will not be in full compliance 
several federal laws could have an impact on our business 
the digital millennium copyright act establishes binding rules that clarify and strengthen protection for copyrighted works in digital form  including works used via the internet and other computer networks 
the child online protection act is intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children 
the children s online privacy protection act of protects the privacy of children using the internet  by requiring  among other things  that in certain specific instances the operator of a web site must obtain parental consent before collecting  using or disclosing personal information from children under the age of  the operator of a web site to make certain disclosures and notices on the web site or online service regarding the collection  use or disclosure of such personal information  and the operator of a web site or online service to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality  security and integrity of personal information collected from children under the age of our efforts to comply with these and other laws subject our business to additional costs  and failure to comply could expose our business to liability 
we are dependent on mitchell rubenstein and laurie s 
silvers  our founders 
mitchell rubenstein  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and laurie s 
silvers  our vice chairman  president and secretary  have been primarily responsible for our organization and development 
the loss of the services of either of these individuals would hurt our business 
if either of these individuals were to leave hollywood media unexpectedly  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
the employment agreements between hollywood media and each of these individuals provide  among other things  that if we terminate either of their agreements without cause  we will have also terminated the other s agreement without cause 
our future success will be dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified and creative key management personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel in our industry and the limited availability of qualified individuals could make it difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we do not succeed in attracting new qualified personnel  or retaining and motivating existing qualified personnel  we may not be able to grow our revenues or expand our operations 
we may be liable for the content we make available on the internet 
there is risk that we could become subject to various types of legal claims relating to the content we make available on our web sites or the downloading and distribution of such content  or the content we license for books  including claims such as defamation  invasion of privacy and copyright infringement 
although we carry liability insurance that covers some types of claims to a limited extent  our insurance may not cover all potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any costs or imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have authorized but unissued preferred stock  which could affect rights of holders of common stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividends  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
in addition  the preferred stock could be issued as a method of discouraging a takeover attempt 
although we do not intend to issue any preferred stock at this time  we may do so in the future 
our articles of incorporation  shareholders rights plan and florida law may discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and our shareholders rights plan may discourage takeover attempts and may make it more difficult to change or remove management 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
under our shareholder s rights plan adopted in  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right for each share of common stock 
if certain events  such as a takeover bid not approved by our board  occur  the rights will then entitle most holders to purchase at a specified price shares of a series of our preferred stock with special voting  dividend and other rights 
in addition  florida has enacted legislation that may deter or frustrate takeovers of florida corporations  such as our company 
the florida control share acquisitions statute provides that shares acquired in a control share acquisition which excludes transactions approved by our board of directors will not have voting rights unless the voting rights are approved by a majority of the corporation s disinterested shareholders 
a control share acquisition is an acquisition  in whatever form  of voting power in any of the following ranges a at least but less than of all voting power  b at least but less than a majority of all voting power  or c a majority or more of all voting power 
the state of florida affiliated transactions statute requires approval by disinterested directors or supermajority approval by disinterested shareholders of certain specified transactions between a public corporation and holders of more than of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or their affiliates 
our stock price is volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
during the months ended december   the trading price for our common stock on the nasdaq stock market ranged from to per share 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as our quarterly operating results  announcements of new products or services  announcements of mergers  acquisitions  strategic alliances  or divestitures and other factors  including similar announcements by other companies that investors may consider to be comparable to us 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may cause the market price of our stock to decrease  regardless of our operating performance 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity securities 
we may issue additional shares of common stock in connection with future financings  acquisitions or other transactions  or pursuant to outstanding stock options  warrants and other convertible securities  and we plan to issue additional stock options from time to time to our employees and directors 
we are generally unable to estimate or predict the amount  timing or nature of future issuances or public sales of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decrease 
in addition  a decline in the price of our common stock would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities 
we may require additional capital to finance our growth or operations and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms 
we have required substantial financing to fund our acquisitions  growth and operations since our inception  and we may require additional financing in the future 
our long term financial success depends on our ability to generate sufficient revenue and cash flow to offset operating expenses 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations 
we cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available or if available  that it will be on favorable terms 
the terms of any financing that we enter into will vary depending on many factors including  among other things  our then current financial condition  the market price of our common stock  and other characteristics and terms of our capital structure including outstanding options and warrants 
we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of equity securities or debt financings 
our issuance of additional equity securities could cause dilution to holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the incurrence of additional debt could increase our interest expense and other debt service obligations and could result in the imposition of covenants that restrict our operational and financial flexibility 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other economic factors may adversely affect our future results or the market price of our stock including recession  war  terrorism 
we operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks 
many of these risks are beyond our control and are driven by factors that we cannot predict 
economic recession  war  terrorism  international incidents  labor strikes and disputes  and other negative economic conditions may cause damage or disruption to our facilities  information systems  vendors  employees  customers and or website traffic  which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations  and stock price

item legal proceedings 
water garden company llc  as plaintiff  v 
hollywood media corp  a florida corporation  hollywood 
com  inc  a california corporation and subsidiary of hollywood media corp  and the tribune company as successor in interest to the times mirror company  as defendants  filed july  in the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles 
water garden company llc filed suit against hollywood media  its subsidiary  hollywood 
com  inc  and the tribune company tribune  among others  claiming damages as a result of alleged defaults by hollywood 
com  inc under a lease for office space entered into by hollywood 
com  inc  as lessee  and water garden company llc water garden  as lessor 
the stated lease term was from january through december tribune guaranteed hollywood 
com  inc s lease obligations 
hollywood media has certain contractual indemnification obligations to tribune relating to tribune s guaranty of the lease 
the claims against hollywood media  but not hollywood 
com  inc  have been dismissed 
as previously reported in hollywood media s form k  on march   the court in this action the water garden lawsuit issued its ruling on motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication  in which it granted  before trial  the motion of plaintiff for summary judgment against defendants hollywood 
com  inc and tribune 
this ruling resulted in the court s entry of a money judgment in the water garden lawsuit on april  against hollywood 
com  inc and tribune  jointly and severally  of  plus reasonable attorneys fees and costs of suit in an amount to be subsequently determined 
interest would accrue on the judgment at the rate of ten percent per annum until paid 
subsequently  on september   the court granted a motion to add certain litigation costs and attorneys fees to the judgment  such that the current principal amount of the judgment  including costs and attorneys fees  is  on may   hollywood 
com inc and tribune filed a notice of appeal with the court in the water garden lawsuit  and also filed a notice of filing undertaking for stay of enforcement of judgment pursuant to appeal in order to stay enforcement of the judgment pending resolution of the appeal this filing included an appeal bond obtained by tribune the appeal bond issued by a surety company in the amount of  which was the amount of the bond required by law to stay enforcement of the judgment 
a stay stops the enforceability of a judgment 
upon the adding of certain costs and attorneys fees to the judgment  the appeal bond was increased to  on november  on february   water garden filed its respondents brief for the appeal  and the reply brief of hollywood 
com  inc and tribune was filed on march  the appeal is currently pending and the appeal hearing is currently scheduled for april  based on the advice of our outside legal counsel  we believe that hollywood 
com  inc has good grounds to win on appeal  and a reasonable possibility exists of the appellate court reversing the trial court s summary judgment ruling 
if such ruling is reversed the matter would then likely be returned to the trial court for a trial of the case 
however  it is not possible at this time to estimate the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome of such an appeal  and accordingly we cannot and do not provide any such evaluation 
in april  tribune and hollywood media agreed that tribune would obtain the appeal bond in exchange for specified advance payments by hollywood media to tribune as collateral to secure hollywood media s indemnification obligation to tribune described above 
the advance payments consist of a  payment made upon commencement of the agreement on april   and monthly payments of  or  for the last six months of 
the agreement allows tribune the right to demand additional collateral  the form of which  cash or shares of hollywood media s common stock  to be determined by hollywood media in its discretion  in the approximate amount of the initial judgment 
hollywood media s obligation to make payments to tribune under such agreement is limited to the amount of the initial judgment plus costs and or attorney s fees that may be awarded and accrued interest 
the advance payments and  if applicable  any other security  are to be returned to hollywood media if the appeal is successful which would result in the bond no longer being required or to the extent the payments ultimately exceed hollywood media s indemnification obligation to tribune 
such payments made to tribune may be used by hollywood media  in its discretion  to pay the judgment or a settlement in the water garden lawsuit 
the judgment in the water garden lawsuit is for rent accrued under the lease through february   however  the facial termination date of the lease is december  if the appeal of the water garden lawsuit is unsuccessful  then  pursuant to a written stipulation between the parties to the lawsuit  the judgment will be modified to add rent accruing between february  and december   together with attorneys fees and costs 
should the appeal be unsuccessful  we anticipate that the amount of the judgment would increase  pursuant to such stipulation  by approximately  hollywood media believes that hollywood 
com  inc has valid grounds for appeal and defenses to the plaintiff s claims 
recognizing that the ultimate outcome of this case is uncertain  hollywood media has accrued on its books  as of december   an amount which it believes is adequate to account for potential liability for this matter  and we will continue to evaluate the matter as the litigation process proceeds 
in addition to the legal proceedings described above  hollywood media is a party to various other legal proceedings see note to hollywood media s consolidated financial statements included in this form k report including matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
hollywood media does not expect such other legal proceedings to have a material adverse impact on hollywood media s financial condition or results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that such other matters  if determined adversely  will not have a material adverse effect

dividend policy hollywood media has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and currently intends to retain any future earnings to finance its operations and the expansion of its business 
therefore  the payment of any cash dividends on the common stock is unlikely in the foreseeable future 
any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent upon hollywood media s earnings  capital requirements and financial condition and such other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors

these changes to our business have affected our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we generated revenues from our intellectual properties business and our entertainment retail operations 
following the closure of our retail stores by the end of and expansion of our business through acquisitions  we currently rely on our data business syndication operations  broadway and movie ticketing operations and advertising sales along with our existing intellectual properties business to generate revenues for the foreseeable future 
the growth of our data syndication  ticketing and internet ad sales operations has required substantial financing and may require additional financing to fund our growth plan and for working capital 
our operating plans and assumptions indicate that anticipated cash flows  when combined with other potential sources of capital  will be sufficient to meet our operating and working capital requirements into the first quarter of if plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may need to seek further financing or reduce the scope of our operations 
our long term financial success depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to offset operating expenses 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations 
in the first quarter  hollywood media completed a million private placement  whereupon the company received net proceeds of approximately million after deduction of expenses in connection with the transaction

hollywood media changed its method of revenue recognition effective january   from recognition of revenue from ticket sales when collection was assured and delivery to the customer had taken place to the date of performance for all ticket sales 
the impact of this change on the financial statements for the period prior to january  was not material

 sfas no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
we determined fair value as the net present value of future cash flows 
based on these evaluations  there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets in   or other than the asset write downs discussed in note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  were no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to june  ceased to be amortized beginning january  in addition  sfas changed the way we evaluated goodwill and intangibles for impairment 
beginning january   goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized  however  they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test 
the fair value based test is a two step test 
the first step involved comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets including unrecognized intangibles and liabilities of the reporting unit  with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value 
as prescribed by sfas no 
 hollywood media completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of which did not result in an impairment charge 
additionally  hollywood media established october  as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date in and see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as of december   hollywood media is not aware of any items or events that would cause it to adjust the recorded value of its goodwill for impairment 
future changes in estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue projections or market values could cause the analysis to indicate that hollywood media s goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a writeoff of a portion or all of the goodwill 
inflation and seasonality although hollywood media cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation  it does not believe inflation has a material effect on sales or results of operations 
hollywood media considers its business to be somewhat seasonal and expects net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for its tekno books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi annually 
the ticketing business is also effected by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the tony awards c and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holiday period 
in addition  although not seasonal  hollywood media s intellectual properties division and netco partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams  earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements 
the recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis 
audit fees and other the aggregate fees billed to hollywood media for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements for the year ended december  and for the reviews of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on form q for the year ended december  were  refer to item principal accounting fees and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in our assets or liabilities that might occur due to changes in market rates and prices  such as interest or foreign currency exchange rates  as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
interest rates charged on hollywood media s debt instruments are primarily fixed in nature 
we therefore do not believe that the risk of loss relating to the effect of changes in market interest rates is material 
we purchase and sell live theater tickets to shows in london s west end 
we minimize our exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates by taking steps to reduce the time lag between the purchase and payment of tickets for the london shows and the collection of related sales proceeds 
we further reduce our exposure by setting favorable currency conversion rates in our foreign ticket pricing 
we do not believe the risk of loss relating to adverse changes in currency exchange rates to be material
