item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the ownership  management and development of hotels  resorts and timeshare properties and the franchising of lodging properties 
at december   our system contained  properties totaling over  rooms 
our brands include hilton  hilton garden inn  doubletree  embassy suites  hampton  homewood suites by hilton and conrad 
in addition  we develop and operate timeshare resorts through hilton grand vacations company and its related entities 
we are also engaged in various other activities related or incidental to the operation of hotels 
the number of properties and rooms at december  by brand and by type are as follows brand properties rooms type properties rooms hilton  owned  hilton garden inn  leased  doubletree  joint venture  embassy suites   homewood suites by hilton  managed  hampton   franchised  other   timeshare  timeshare  total   total   our operations consist of three reportable segments which are based on similar products or services hotel ownership  managing and franchising  and timeshare 
the hotel ownership segment derives revenue from owned  majority owned and leased hotel properties 
the managing and franchising segment provides services including hotel management and licensing of our family of brands to franchisees 
this segment generates its revenue from fees charged to hotel owners 
as a manager of hotels  we are typically responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for fees based on a percentage of the hotel s gross revenue  operating profits  cash flow  or a combination thereof 
we charge franchise fees  depending on the brand  of up to five percent of rooms revenue in exchange for the use of one of our brand names 
the timeshare segment consists of multi unit timeshare resorts 
this segment derives its revenue from selling and financing timeshare intervals and operating timeshare resorts 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates achieved by hotels  our ability to manage costs  the relative mix of owned  leased  managed and franchised hotels  the quantity and pricing of timeshare interval sales and the change in the number of available hotel rooms through acquisition  development and disposition 
results are also impacted by economic conditions and capacity 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which  in turn  could limit our ability to pass through operating cost increases in the form of higher room rates 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
see additional information business risks and forward looking statements under item for a detailed description of these and other conditions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we anticipate that improving economic and political factors will create opportunities for the lodging industry and our company in improving economic conditions are expected to result in increased business travel  which when combined with strong leisure travel and limited full service supply growth  should increase our ability to charge higher room rates 
we also anticipate growth in our management and franchise fee business as our system of hotels continues to increase  as well as another strong year from our timeshare business 
challenges in are expected to include continued short reservation lead times for our group business  with markets in san francisco san jose and chicago expected to be difficult 
in addition  cost increases in healthcare  insurance and property taxes are expected to continue to put pressure on margins 
we will continue to focus on managing our costs  achieving revenue per available room revpar premiums in the markets where we operate  building occupancy  adding new units to our family of brands  leveraging technology and delivering outstanding customer service 
we believe that our focus on these core strategies  combined with our financial strength  diverse market presence  strong brands  and well maintained  strategically located properties will enable us to remain competitive 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to notes receivable  valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets  self insurance reserves and commitments  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
notes receivable are reflected net of an estimated allowance for uncollectable amounts 
for timeshare notes receivable  this estimate is based primarily on historical experience and assumptions with respect to future payment trends 
allowances for uncollectable amounts of other notes receivable  which includes notes from managed  franchised and unconsolidated joint venture properties  are estimated based primarily on historical trends and analysis of underlying real estate collateral 
assessment of collateral may include estimates of future cash flow from the underlying real estate 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we also maintain cost and equity method investments in entities that own and operate hotel properties and entities that perform other activities related or incidental to the operation of hotels 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make certain judgments  including estimates of real estate values and future cash flow from the respective properties and investments 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
our intangible assets include management and franchise contracts  leases  brands and goodwill 
the values of our management and franchise contracts and leases are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the agreements 
the assessment of management and franchise contracts and leases requires us to make certain judgments  including estimates of future cash flow from the respective properties 
we account for brands and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard fas  which requires that intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are reviewed annually for impairment 
the annual impairment review requires estimates of future cash flow with respect to the brands and estimates of the fair value of our company and its components with respect to goodwill 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental insurance coverage 
insurance reserves include the present values of projected settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims 
projected settlements are estimated based on historical trends and actuarial data 
we have issued letters of credit and guaranteed certain debt and obligations of unconsolidated affiliates and third parties 
under certain circumstances  we may be obligated to provide additional letters of credit or guarantees 
assessment of the probability that we will be required to fund under these commitments requires us to make estimates of the ability of others to meet their obligations 
the estimates and assumptions related to notes receivable  long lived assets  intangible assets and commitments are subject to change based on updated projections as to the future performance of the related hotel properties 
self insurance reserves are periodically adjusted based on historical trends  including the volume and amount of claim activity 
because estimates are used  it is reasonably likely that there will be some variability between projected and actual results over time 
development and capital spending overview we intend to grow our hotel brands primarily through franchising and the addition of management contracts  which require little or no capital investment 
we will also continue to invest in capital improvements and select projects at our owned hotels and the development of timeshare properties 
in addition  we may seek to acquire ownership interests in hotel properties on a strategic and selective basis  either directly or through investments in joint ventures 
see joint ventures alliances below 
during  we added hotels with approximately  rooms to our portfolio 
a total of properties with approximately  rooms were removed from our system in in  we expect to add to hotels with  to  rooms to our system  with hampton and hilton garden inn accounting for most of the new development 
substantially all of this growth is expected to be through franchise and management agreements 
we believe our brand growth strategy continues to benefit from the significant market share premiums most of our brands command over their respective competitive sets 
with representing a brand s fair share of the market  our brands according to smith travel research posted revenue per available room revpar index numbers as follows for embassy suites   homewood suites by hilton   hampton inn   hilton garden inn   hilton   and doubletree  in addition  in august  three of our brands earned first place awards from jd power associates for highest customer satisfaction embassy suites in the upscale category the fifth consecutive win for that brand  hilton garden inn in the mid priced category its second win in as many years of eligibility and homewood suites by hilton in the extended stay category 
we believe the continued strong performance of our brands has enabled us to significantly enhance our development pipeline versus our industry competitors 
in october  lodging econometrics noted that for the first time hilton had more rooms in the active us development pipeline than any other company 
our ability to grow the number of managed and franchised hotels is affected by the factors set forth under additional information business risks and forward looking statements  under item  including national and regional economic conditions  the effects of actual and threatened terrorist attacks and international conflicts  credit availability  relationships with franchisees and owners  and competition from other hotel brands 
in total  we anticipate spending approximately million on capital expenditures in  which includes million on routine improvements and technology  million on timeshare projects and million on hotel special projects 
routine improvements include expenditures for equipment  hotel fixtures  and wall and floor coverings 
expenditures required to complete our capital spending programs will be financed through available cash flow and general corporate borrowings 
we will continue to review our owned hotel portfolio for potential repositioning or rebranding opportunities and may seek to sell certain assets see liquidity and capital resources acquisitions and dispositions and joint ventures alliances 
hotel ownership capital expenditures during excluding timeshare projects totaled million  including routine improvements and technology expenditures as well as capital expenditures related to the mold remediation efforts at the hilton hawaiian village 
the kalia tower at the hilton hawaiian village successfully reopened to guests in september see development and capital spending timeshare 
we continue to place a priority on making appropriate capital expenditures to maintain our owned assets 
for  we expect to allocate approximately six percent of owned hotel revenue for routine improvements 
as part of this program  we will be spending approximately million in to upgrade the bedding at our owned hotels 
managing and franchising total property additions to our system in included franchise properties and six managed properties owned by third parties 
these additions included properties which  due in part to the market share leadership of our brands and the challenging environment for many hotel operators  were converted to our family of brands in the conversions include nine doubletrees  eight hamptons  three hilton garden inns  one homewood suites by hilton and one hilton 
the doubletree conversions include four franchised properties in tennessee converted from an independent brand and the first doubletree hotel in canada  a room property at toronto airport 
additions in included the first hampton inn in manhattan  with a total of five hampton inns expected to open in new york city by  and the opening of the suite embassy suites niagara falls in ontario  canada

pursuant to a joint venture with hilton international co  a new managed conrad hotel opened in bali  indonesia in march  while others are scheduled to open in miami  florida in april and phuket  thailand in march new hilton managed convention hotels opened in houston  texas and austin  texas in december  while another is on track to open in omaha  nebraska in april in addition  during we secured the management contract for the room hilton cancun beach golf resort in mexico  previously a hilton franchised hotel 
we also announced an agreement to convert the former adam s mark hotel in memphis to a room hilton in march following a major renovation 
timeshare we are currently developing new timeshare projects in las vegas  nevada and orlando  florida  and have recently completed another project in honolulu  hawaii 
the las vegas project  located at the north end of the las vegas strip  has units in its first phase  which opened in october in orlando  the new project will have units in its first two phases  of which phase one opened in february while phase two is scheduled for completion in may in honolulu  we converted six floors of the kalia tower at the hilton hawaiian village into timeshare units  which were completed in december the total construction cost for phase one at the new las vegas property  phases one and two at the new orlando property and the unit kalia tower conversion is estimated to be million  of which million was spent in capital expenditures associated with our timeshare operations during totaled million 
the capital expenditures associated with our non lease timeshare products are reflected as inventory until the timeshare intervals are sold 
we also provide financing to the buyers of our timeshare intervals 
during  we issued approximately million of loans related to timeshare financings  which comprised the majority of our additional investments of million 
principal collections on timeshare notes during the same period were approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources overview net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in was due primarily to lower operating results  as well as working capital variances 
the working capital variances include an increase in inventories in related to additional spending for our timeshare developments 
the increase in compared to was due to working capital variances  including the realization of an income tax receivable in and a significant reduction in accounts receivable which benefited the period 
net cash provided by operating activities in  and each benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance for capital loss tax carryforwards and other items which reduced the provision for income taxes see liquidity and capital resources acquisitions and dispositions  joint ventures alliances under item and notes to consolidated financial statements income taxes under item 
our ability to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards to reduce our provision for income taxes is dependent on the availability of capital loss tax carryforwards and the existence of transactions that enable these capital loss tax carryforwards to be utilized 
therefore  it should not be assumed that such benefits will be available to us in the future 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in and million in the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased proceeds from asset dispositions in compared to the prior year  as well as the absence of acquisition activity in in comparison to the acquisition of the hilton waikoloa village in may in addition  capital expenditures in were lower than  as significant construction projects at the hilton portland  hilton new orleans riverside and the hilton san francisco were completed in net cash used in investing activities increased million from million in to million in primarily due to the waikoloa purchase  an increase in additional investments and a reduction in proceeds from asset dispositions compared to  partially offset by reduced capital expenditures 
the increase in additional investments was primarily due to an increase in notes receivable issued to the buyers of our timeshare intervals  while the decrease in capital expenditures reflects higher levels of spending in related to expansion projects at the hilton hawaiian village  hilton portland and hilton seattle 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  reflecting the repayment of long term debt and revolving loans in excess of additional long term borrowings 
for the three years ended december   total debt has been reduced by approximately billion 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities in compared to reflects higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock in  which is primarily reflective of increased stock option exercises in the period 
our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december   and was x  x and x  respectively 
cash and equivalents totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  we believe that our operating cash flow  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities as described below  and our ability to obtain additional financing through various financial markets are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
however  any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty 
see results of operations under item and additional information business risks and forward looking statements for further discussion of conditions that could adversely affect our estimates of future financial needs and sources of working capital 
financing in june  we entered into a five year million revolving credit facility to acquire the remaining interest in the hilton hawaiian village 
in may  this facility was repaid and the commitment was extinguished 
in august  we established a new five year revolving credit facility in the amount of billion  with an option to increase the size of the facility by an additional million 
this facility replaced our billion revolving facility which was set to expire in november and our million day revolving facility which was set to expire in november  and the commitment under these facilities was extinguished

in connection with the spin off in of our gaming business to a new corporation named park place entertainment corporation  park place assumed and agreed to pay of the amount of each payment required to be made by us under the terms of the indentures governing our million senior notes due because these notes remain our legal obligation  they are included in our long term debt balance and a long term receivable from park place in an equal amount is included in our consolidated balance sheet 
these notes are classified in our balance sheet as current maturities of long term debt with the offsetting receivable classified in other current assets 
in january  park place changed their name to caesars entertainment  inc we remain obligated to make any payment caesars fails to make under these notes 
in november  we entered into a derivative contract which swaps the fixed interest payments on our million senior notes due to a floating interest rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate plus basis points

the impact of the cash trap  which is expected to remain in effect throughout  is not expected to have a material impact on our liquidity

however  the sale generated a capital gain for tax purposes  which enabled us to utilize existing capital loss tax carryforwards that had been fully reserved in prior periods 
the transaction  including the impact of the reduction of the valuation allowance associated with the capital loss tax carryforwards  resulted in a million book tax benefit 
thus  on an after tax basis  the sale had no impact on reported net income 
the total pre tax loss on asset dispositions of million in represents the million net pre tax loss on the aforementioned asset sales and a loss of approximately million primarily as a result of writing off the value assigned to several long term management and franchise agreements which were terminated during the year

results of operations the following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the three years ended december  our operations consist of three reportable segments which are based on similar products or services hotel ownership  managing and franchising  and timeshare 
fiscal compared with fiscal overview a summary of our consolidated results for the years ended december  and is as follows change in millions  except per share amounts revenue   operating income net income basic eps 

diluted eps 

overall results in were adversely impacted by a soft us economy and reduced travel as a result of the conflict in iraq 
although demand from leisure travelers remained solid  soft demand from business travelers and higher rated groups resulted in overall average daily rate declines in furthermore  results were also negatively impacted by increased healthcare  insurance and property tax costs 
the impact to operating results of property dispositions in and was partially offset by the may acquisition of the hilton waikoloa village 
results benefited from increased fee income as the result of unit growth  strong results from our timeshare operations  lower interest expense and a reduction in the provision for income taxes 
revenue from owned hotels totaled billion in  a decrease of three percent from billion in results at our owned hotels were adversely impacted by the economic downturn in the united states and reduced travel as a result of the conflict in iraq 
at our owned hotels  we experienced downward pressure on room rates owing primarily to a shift in our customer mix from the higher rated group and business transient segments to the more price sensitive leisure customer 
owing to these rate declines  our comparable owned hotels reported a three percent revenue decline during revpar for comparable owned properties declined percent for the year  with occupancy down from percent to percent and average daily rate down percent to 
however  comparatively solid occupancy levels were achieved at many of our owned hotels  including those in new york  boston and hawaii  primarily through increased demand from leisure customers and lower rated groups 
total expenses from owned hotels increased three percent in to billion 
expenses for our comparable owned hotels also increased three percent  or million  during  of which million was due to increased healthcare  insurance and property tax costs 
salaries and wages excluding benefits  which is the largest component of the cost structure at our owned hotels  increased percent compared to the prior year 
we expect our owned hotels will be further challenged in by short reservation lead times for our group business  with the san francisco san jose and chicago markets expected to be difficult 
these markets comprised approximately percent of our owned hotel revenue in increases in healthcare  insurance and property tax costs are also expected to continue to place pressure on owned hotel margins 
however  improving economic conditions are expected to result in increased business travel  which when combined with strong leisure travel and limited full service supply growth  should give rise to increased pricing power 
leased hotel revenue totaled million in  an million decrease compared to  while leased hotel expenses declined million to million in the winter olympics benefited the prior year results at our leased property in salt lake city  utah 
due to the relatively large size of the lease payments required in a hotel operating lease  the leased properties operate at margins significantly lower than our owned hotels 
management and franchise fee revenue in increased million or two percent to million 
fee revenue is based primarily on rooms revenue at franchised properties and total operating revenue and to a lesser extent gross operating profits or cash flow at managed properties 
new hotel openings resulted in increased fees during the year  partially offset by lower comparable base and incentive fees primarily due to revpar declines 
strong leisure demand  along with less impact from the iraq conflict in our drive to markets  enabled our focused service  midscale brands to post generally smaller revpar declines or in the case of hilton garden inn  post a revpar gain for the year when compared to our full service  urban properties 
we expect management and franchise fees to continue to increase in as economic conditions improve and our system of managed and franchised hotels continues to grow 
the increase in timeshare and other income in is primarily the result of increased timeshare revenue 
revenue from our timeshare operations totaled million  an increase of million from  while timeshare expenses in totaled million  a million increase from timeshare revenue and earnings are generated through developing timeshare resorts and selling the related intervals  financing the sale of timeshare intervals and through management of timeshare resorts 
overall timeshare interval sales increased five percent in  while the average sales price increased nine percent 
results in also benefited from the recognition of revenue previously deferred under the required percentage of completion method of construction accounting  as the first phases of our new developments in orlando and las vegas were substantially completed or opened during in addition  results in benefited from increased resort management earnings  including rental and other service income 
financing income decreased in due to the sale of receivables in and decreased interest rates 
timeshare results in were negatively impacted by a million charge for remediation efforts related to mold found in certain areas of the lagoon tower timeshare development  the sale of timeshare receivables  revisions to final construction costs in hawaii also related to the mold situation  and start up costs in new york 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in to million  primarily due to property sales and one time depreciation expense adjustments totaling approximately million made at certain properties in the second quarter 
results in include impairment loss and related costs totaling million 
these costs include a million pre tax charge related to the decline in value of certain equity securities held by us 
the decline in value of the securities was deemed to be other than temporary in the first quarter  thus requiring an earnings charge  primarily based on the length of time the securities had traded below cost 
the charge also includes a million pre tax impairment charge to reduce the value of an owned red lion hotel and a doubletree management contract to their respective fair values

fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that guarantees issued after december  be recorded as liabilities at fair value  with the offsetting entry recorded based on the circumstances in which the guarantee was issued 
adoption of fin had no impact on our historical consolidated financial statements as existing guarantees are not subject to the measurement provisions of fin adoption and implementation of fin for new guarantees did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in in december  the fasb issued fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas this statement provides alternate methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of fas and accounting principles board opinion  interim financial reporting  to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim consolidated financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fas in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities to expand upon existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
under previous accounting guidance  we generally have included another entity in our consolidated financial statements only if we have a controlling financial interest in the entity through voting or other interests 
fin changes that guidance by requiring a variable interest entity vie  as defined  to be consolidated by the company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
fin also requires disclosure about vies that a company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
these disclosures include the nature  purpose  size and activity of the vie as well as the holder s maximum exposure to losses as a result of involvement with the vie 
our evaluation of the provisions of fin as it relates to our various forms of arrangements has focused primarily on reviewing the key terms of our joint venture agreements  management contracts and franchise agreements against the criteria in fin to determine if any of these arrangements qualify as vies 
in general  a vie represents a structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or that has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
in the first quarter of  we adopted fin for vies created after january   which resulted in no impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revised fin fin r that replaced the original interpretation and codified proposed modifications and other decisions previously issued through certain fasb staff positions including the deferral of the effective date of applying fin r to certain variable interests created before february  fin r is effective march  for such arrangements 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin r as it relates to our joint venture agreements  management contracts and franchise agreements created before february  although our evaluation is continuing  we have not identified vies in our joint ventures  management contracts or franchise agreements  and therefore we currently expect any disclosure or consolidation requirements will be immaterial 
in may  the fasb issued fas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which is effective for the quarter ending september  for financial instruments existing at may  this statement requires three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer to be classified as liabilities at fair value 
adoption of fas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

this statement revises the required footnote disclosures without changing the measurement or recognition provisions of existing postretirement benefit accounting literature 
the disclosure provisions of fasr require additional disclosures regarding the types of plan assets  plan obligations  cash flows  our investment strategy  measurement dates and the components of net periodic benefit cost recognized 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of accounting principles board opinion  interim financial reporting  to require prominent disclosures in our interim consolidated financial statements of the net periodic benefit cost and significant changes to actual contributions and projected contributions to fund benefit plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the form of changes in interest rates and the potential impact such changes may have on the cash flow from our floating rate debt and the fair values of our fixed rate debt 
we attempt to limit the impact of changes in interest rates to our debt portfolio by attaining an appropriate mix of borrowings under our floating rate bank credit facilities relative to our long term fixed rate debt 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable and the fair values of our fixed rate notes receivable 
we utilize  on a selective basis  interest rate swaps to manage our relative levels of fixed and floating rate debt 
as of december   we had a derivative contract which swaps the fixed interest payments on our million senior notes due to a floating interest rate equal to the six month libor rate plus basis points 
we also have a derivative contract which swaps the floating rate mortgage of one of our majority owned hotels  which had a principal balance of million at december   to a fixed interest rate 
we are also exposed to market risk in the form of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the potential impact such changes may have on the cash flow related to our foreign currency denominated debt 
in august  we issued million of bonds due denominated in chilean pesos 
payments of principal and interest on the bonds are adjusted for movements of the unidad de fomento the chilean inflation index published monthly by the central bank of chile 
we have swapped out the chilean currency exchange rate and inflation risk by entering into a derivative contract which swaps the principal payment to a fixed us dollar amount of million with fixed interest payments at of that amount 
we believe it is unlikely that the counterparty will be unable to perform under the terms of the derivative instrument
