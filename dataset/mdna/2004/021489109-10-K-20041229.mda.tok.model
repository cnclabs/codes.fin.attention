item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to our management 
additional forward looking statements may be identified by the words anticipate  believe  expect  intend  plan  or the negative of such terms  or similar expressions  as they relate to us or our management 
the forward looking statements contained herein reflect our judgment as of the date of this report with respect to future events  the outcome of which is subject to certain risks  that may have a significant impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
you are cautioned that these forward looking statements are inherently uncertain 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those described herein 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
you should carefully review the cautionary statements contained in this form k  including the certain factors affecting business  operating results and financial condition below 
overview we are a pioneer and market leader in internet protocol telephony systems for small to medium sized businesses 
we design  manufacture and market next generation  internet protocol phone systems and contact centers that use both the internet and the public telephone network to take advantage of the convergence of voice and data communications 
unlike traditional proprietary phone systems  our systems are designed with open architecture and are built on an industry standard platform 
this adherence to industry standards allows our products to play an important role in the small to medium sized business market by delivering phone systems that can integrate with other technologies and provide integrated voice and data solutions 
we believe this enables our customers to implement communication systems that have an increased return versus past technology investments 
we generated net revenues of million  for a net profit of  during fiscal year as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
net cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal year we derive our revenues from sales of our altiserv telephone systems 
product revenues consist of sales to end users including dealers and to distributors 
revenues from product sales to end users and resellers are recognized upon shipment 
we defer recognition of revenue for sales to distributors until they resell our products to their customers 
upon shipment  we also provide a reserve for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty 
under our distribution contracts  a distributor has the right  in certain circumstances  to return products it determines are overstocked  so long as it provides an offsetting purchase order for products in an amount equal to or greater than the dollar value of the returned products 
in addition  we provide distributors protection from subsequent price reductions 
our cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs and overhead related to the manufacturing of our products 
several factors that have affected and will continue to affect our revenue growth are the state of economy  the market acceptance of our products  our ability to add new resellers and our ability to design  develop  and release new products 
we engage a third party assemblers  which in fiscal year were all quality services and bestronics in san jose  to insert the hardware components into the printed circuit board 
we selected our manufacturing partners with the goals of ensuring a reliable supply of high quality finished products and lowering per unit product costs as a result of manufacturing economies of scale 
we cannot assure that we will maintain the volumes required to realize these economies of scale or when or if such cost reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
as of september   we had cumulative net operating loss carry forwards for federal and california income tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset income in future years 
the cumulative net operating loss carry forwards will expire in various periods from to  if they are not utilized 
under current tax law  net operating loss carry forwards available in any given year may be limited upon the occurrence of certain events  including changes of ownership interest 
we have not recognized any future tax benefits of our cumulative net operating losses due to uncertainty as to future realizability 
we continue to focus on developing enhancements to our current products to provide greater functionality and increased capabilities  based on our market research  customer feedback and our competitors product offerings and creating new product offerings 
in particular  we are focusing on developing products that allow us to enhance our position in our target market segment and enter new geographical markets 
additionally  we intend to continue to focus on selling our products to small to medium sized businesses and branch offices of larger corporations  which are business with less than employees  with particular emphasis in the internet protocol phone systems segment of the telecommunications market 
also  we plan to continue to recruit additional resellers and distributors that focus on selling phone systems to our target customers 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in developing any new products or enhancements to existing products  entering new geographical or product markets or expanding our network of resellers 
we believe that the adoption rate for this new technology is much faster with small to medium sized businesses because they have no significant investment on their books for traditional phone systems 
also we believe that small to medium sized businesses are looking for call center type administration to increase the productivity and efficiency of their contacts with customers 
assuming the continued market trends  successful product enhancements  the continuing acceptance of the call center products  continuing growth in the marketplaces of china  the united kingdom and norway  and the status quo of the north american economy  we expect to see continued revenue growth for fiscal at a rate equal to this fiscal year 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
revenues consist of sales to end users  including resellers  and to distributors 
revenues from sales to end users are recognized upon shipment  when risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the price is fixed and determinable 
sales to distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return and protection against subsequent price declines on the our products held by its distributors 
upon termination  any unsold products may be returned by the distributor for a full refund 
these agreements may be canceled by either party based on a specified notice 
as a result of the above provisions  we defer recognition of distributor revenues until such distributors resell our products to their customers 
the amounts deferred as a result of this policy are reflected as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the related cost of revenues is also deferred and reported in the consolidated balance sheets as inventory 
our total deferred revenue was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  we could be required to increase our allowance and our earnings could be adversely affected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
our inventory balance was million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
we regularly review the value of our inventory in detail  with consideration given to future customer demand for our products  obsolescence from rapidly changing technology  and other factors 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  and our estimates prove to be inaccurate  we could be required to increase our inventory provision and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
our inventory allowance was million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
warranty 
we accrue for warranty costs based on estimated product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if actual return rates and repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
the liability for product warranties was  and  as of september  and september   respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenues

net revenues by products fiscal year ended september  hardware software net revenues by geographic area fiscal year ended september  americas international net revenues by customers fiscal year ended september  altisys ingram micro synnex graybar revenues generated in the americas accounted for million or of revenues in fiscal year and million or of revenues in fiscal year net revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year due to the increased sales in telephone systems as a result of upgrading the quality of our authorized resellers  selling more products into the call center market space  the sales of larger systems and the doubling of our international revenues  especially in china 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in fiscal year increased million or to million from approximately million in fiscal year due to an increase in overall sales of products and the requisite increase in product costs 
cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease was caused by the decrease in warranty reserve of  due to the decline in the product return rate and the  adjustment of the inventory allowance associated with the sale of products which were previously reserved 
no additional provision for excess or obsolete inventory was necessary in either fiscal year and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products and enhancement of our converged telephone system software 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due in part to the increase in sales volume and the decrease in absolute dollars 
the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was primarily a result of decreases in headcount related costs of  resulting from a reduction in our workforce  a decrease in depreciation cost of  and a decrease in office rent expense of  associated with the facilities change in fremont  california 
we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively flat due to the uncertainty about customers spending patterns in the current economic environment 
management continues to monitor research and development expenses in line with revenue opportunities 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as trade shows  advertising  and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by approximately million or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due in part to the increase in sales volume and the decrease in absolute dollars 
the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily a result of a decrease in headcount related costs of  due to workforce reduction in the sales and marketing group  a decrease in depreciation costs of  and a decrease in office rent expense of  associated with the facilities change in fremont  california 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat due to the uncertainty about customers spending patterns in the current economic environment  however  some expenses vary with revenues  such as commissions  which grow with increasing sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  facilities  bad debt  legal  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at million for fiscal year and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due to the increase in sales volume 
we expect to maintain general and administrative expenses at the same level 
it is unclear at this time what the impact on expenses would be as a result of complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act during fiscal year amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we had no amortization of deferred stock compensation in fiscal year amortization of deferred stock compensation was  in fiscal year deferred stock compensation expense reflects the amortization of stock compensation charges resulting from granting stock options prior to our initial public offering at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock on the dates the options were granted 
we amortize these deferred amounts using the straight line method over the vesting period of the related stock options 
all remaining deferred stock compensation was amortized in fiscal year interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of interest received from full repayment of an outstanding promissory note held by our chief executive officer  gilbert hu in fiscal and a decrease in invested principal due to cash being used in operations 
we expect net interest and other income to remain relatively flat with little change in cash available to invest  and relatively flat interest rates 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues  net 
revenues consist of sales to end users including resellers and distributors 
net revenues by products fiscal year ended september  hardware software net revenues by geographic area fiscal year ended september  americas international net revenues by customers fiscal year ended september  altisys ingram micro synnex revenues generated in the americas accounted for million or of revenues in fiscal year and million or of revenues in fiscal year net revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year due to the introduction of a new line of altiserv office  altiserv ip and altiserv ip  which offer our customers an all voice over internet protocol phone system 
in fiscal year  we started selling our own internet protocol phone that generated revenue of million 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in fiscal year increased million or to million from approximately million in fiscal year due to an increase in overall sales of products and the requisite increase in product costs 
cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year production overhead and manufacturing and other related costs decreased in fiscal  compared with fiscal  which resulted in an increase in product gross margin and an increase in net revenues 
production overhead in fiscal decreased by  from  in fiscal to  this decrease was primarily caused by lower labor and overhead expenses 
in addition  manufacturing and other related costs in fiscal decreased by  from  in fiscal to  resulting from lower warranty reserve due to the decline in the product return rate  lower depreciation on equipment and facilities charges associated with manufacturing activities 
no additional provision for excess or obsolete inventory was necessary in either fiscal year and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products and enhancement of our converged telephone system software 
research and development expenses decreased slightly by approximately million or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due in part to the increase in sales volume and the decrease in absolute dollars 
the slight decrease in absolute dollars was primarily a result of decreases in headcount related costs of  resulting from reduction in workforce  depreciation cost of  partly offset by an increase in equipment expense and consultant cost of  and write off of equipment of  we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively flat due to the uncertainty about customers spending patterns in the current economic environment 
management continues to monitor research and development expenses in line with revenue growth 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as trade shows  advertising  and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by approximately million or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due in part to the increase in sales volume and the decrease in absolute dollars

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  facilities  bad debt  legal  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year due in part to the increase in sales volume and the decrease in absolute dollars 
the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to a reduction in professional fees of approximately  slightly lower personnel levels and related expenditures of approximately  as well as tighter controls over allowable discretionary spending amounts 
we expect to maintain general and administrative expenses at the same level 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was  in fiscal year as compared to  in fiscal year deferred stock compensation expense reflects the amortization of stock compensation charges resulting from granting stock options at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock on the dates the options were granted 
we amortize these deferred amounts using the straight line method over the vesting period of the related stock options 
all remaining deferred stock compensation was amortized in fiscal year write down of long term investment 
we perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment 
our investments are considered impaired when a review of the investees operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  limited prospects of receiving additional financing  and limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
during fiscal year  we recorded a noncash  permanent write down of  related to impairments of our investment 
no write down was recorded during fiscal year interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income decreased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to declining interest income caused by a decrease in invested principal due to cash being used in operations 
we expect net interest and other income to continue to decrease as a result of further decreases in cash available to invest and relatively flat or lower interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
as of september   we had cash and short term investments totaling million consisting of cash and cash equivalents of million with a maturity of less than days and million of short term investment with a maturity of greater than days 
dollars in thousand cash and cash equivalents    short term investments    total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  percentage of total assets cash used in operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities   cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents   changes in cash flows during fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was  which is million lower than the cash used in operating activities during fiscal due to a net profit being generated for the first time in fiscal year in fiscal  our use of cash for non operating activities was primarily attributable to the  of capital spending on equipment additions to support our operations   for investment in a korean company and a  increase in a long term deposit 
as a result  during the twelve months ended september   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities remained flat as compared to september  net accounts receivable increased to million at september  from million at september  the increase in net accounts receivable was primarily due to increases in sales of our products 
we ended the fourth quarter of fiscal with a cash conversion cycle of days as compared to days for the fourth quarter of fiscal the cash conversion cycle is the duration between purchase of inventories and services and the collection of the cash from the sale of our products and services and is a metric on which we have focused as we continue to try to efficiently manage our assets 
the cash conversion cycle results from the calculation of days of sales outstanding dso added to days of supply in inventories dos  reduced by days of payable outstanding dpo 
inventories increased to million at september  from million at september  and our inventory turn rate remained flat at times as of september  our inventory turn rate represents the number of times inventory is replenished during the year 
inventory management will continue to be an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
accounts payable decreased to  at september  from  at september  this decrease primarily was due to a decrease in the number of components purchased at the end of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year our accrued payroll related liabilities increased to  at september  from  at september   primarily as a result of a increase in incentive compensation  vacation accrual and employee stock purchase plan contribution 
in fiscal  our net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to the  of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan 
liquidity and capital resources we intend to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing investment grade securities 
our cash needs depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of and demand for our products  our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to existing products  the prices at which we can sell our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and expense associated with expanding our distribution channels  increases in manufacturing costs and the prices of the components we purchase  as well as other factors 
if we are unable to raise additional capital or if sales from our new products or enhancements are lower than expected  we will be required to make additional reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures to ensure that we will have adequate cash reserves to fund operations 
additional financing  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we also may require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products  or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we cannot raise funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to further develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business 
even if additional financing is available  we may be required to obtain the consent of our stockholders  which we may or may not be able to obtain 
in addition  the issuance of equity or equity related securities will dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of us 
we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of september  we have a commitment under our noncancellable operating lease in the amount of million as of september  we believe  we have sufficient cash reserves to allow us to continue operations for more than a year assuming our quarterly cash usage rate does not deteriorate over that period 
our cash and short term investments totaled million as of september   and our quarter ended september  generated  from operating activities 
payment due by period total less than year years years more than years operating leases obligation  capital leases obligation total  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no

r on a going forward basis 
certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial condition you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this form k 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition and result of operations could be harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
risks related to altigen we have had a history of losses and may incur future losses  which may prevent us from maintaining profitability 
we have had a history of operating losses since our inception  and as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may incur operating losses in the future  and these losses could be substantial and impact our ability to maintain profitability 
we do not expect to increase expenditures for product development  general and administrative expenses  and sales and marketing expenses  however  if we cannot maintain current revenues or revenue growth  we will not maintain profitability or positive operating cash flows 
even if we achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or positive operating cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and our future prospects 
we shipped our first products in july as a result of our limited operating history  we have limited financial data that you can use to evaluate our business 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and challenges we might encounter because we are at an early stage of development in a new and rapidly evolving market 
to address these risks and maintain profitability and increased sales levels  we must establish and increase market acceptance of our technology  products and systems  expand our network of distributors  dealers and companies that buy our products in bulk  customize them for particular applications or customers  and resell them under their own names  introduce products and systems incorporating our technology and enhancements to our product applications on a timely basis  respond effectively to competitive pressures  and successfully market and support our products and systems 
we may not successfully meet any of these challenges  and our failure to do so will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  because of our limited operating history  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and harm our business 
our operating results vary  making future operating results difficult to predict 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and likely will vary significantly in the future 
a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause our operating results to vary  including our sales cycle  which may vary substantially from customer to customer  unfavorable changes in the prices and delivery of the components we purchase  the size and timing of orders for our products  which may vary depending on the season  and the contractual terms of the orders  the size and timing of our expenses  including operating expenses and expenses of developing new products and product enhancements  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products  services or product enhancements introduced by us or by our competitors  and our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products 
our future projected budgets and commitments are based in part on our expectations of future sales 
if our sales do not meet expectations  it will be difficult for us to reduce our expenses quickly and  consequently  our operating results may suffer 
our dealers often require immediate shipment and installation of our products 
as a result  we have historically operated with limited backlog  and our sales and operating results in any quarter primarily depend on orders booked and shipped during that quarter 
any of the above factors could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance 
our market is highly competitive and we may not have the resources to adequately compete 
the market for our integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors develop new products and new competitors enter the market 
we believe that a critical component to success in this market is the ability to establish and maintain strong partner and customer relationships with a wide variety of domestic and international providers 
if we fail to establish or maintain these relationships  we will be at a serious competitive disadvantage 
we face competition from companies providing traditional private telephone systems 
our principal competitors that produce these telephone systems are avaya communications  nec and nortel networks 
we also compete against providers of multi function telecommunications systems  including shoreline communications  inc  com corporation  and cisco systems  inc  as well as any number of future competitors 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have significantly greater name recognition  financial resources  sales and marketing teams  technical and customer support  manufacturing capabilities and other resources 
these competitors also may have more established distribution channels and stronger relationships with service providers 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
these competitors may enter our existing or future markets with products that may be less expensive  provide higher performance or additional features or be introduced earlier than our phone systems 
we also expect that other companies may enter our market with better products and technologies 
if any technology that is competing with ours is more reliable  faster  less expensive or has other advantages over our technology  then the demand for our products and services could decrease and harm our business 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or new technologies 
if our competitors successfully introduce new products or enhance their existing products  our sales or market acceptance of our products and services could be reduced  price competition could decreased or make our products could become obsolete 
to be competitive  therefore  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive  which in turn will cause our business to suffer 
losing any of our key distributors would harm our business 
we also need to establish and maintain relationships with additional distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
sales through our four key distributors  altisys  ingram micro inc  graybar and synnex  accounted for of our net revenues in the fiscal year ended september  graybar became our distributor starting in june our business and operating results will suffer if any one of these distributors does not continue distributing our products  fails to distribute the volume of our products that it currently distributes or fails to expand our customer base 
we also need to establish and maintain relationships with additional distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
we may not be able to establish  or successfully manage  relationships with additional distribution partners 
in addition  our agreements with distributors typically provide for termination by either party upon written notice to the other party 
for example  our agreement with ingram micro provides for termination  with or without cause  by either party upon days written notice to the other party  or upon insolvency or bankruptcy 
generally  these agreements are non exclusive and distributors sell products that compete with ours 
if we fail to establish or maintain relationships with distributors and original equipment manufacturers  our ability to increase or maintain our sales and our customer base will be substantially harmed 
we sell our products through dealers and distributors  which limits our ability to control the timing of our sales  and which makes it more difficult to predict our revenues 
we do not recognize revenue from the sale of our products to our distributors until these products are sold to either resellers or end users 
we have little control over the timing of product sales to dealers and end users 
our lack of control over the revenue that we recognize from our distributors sales to resellers and end users limits our ability to predict revenue for any given period 
our future projected budgets and commitments are based in part on our expectations of future sales 
if our sales do not meet expectations  it will be difficult for us to reduce our expenses quickly  and consequently our operating results may suffer 
we rely on sole sourced components and third party technology and products  if these components are not available  our business may suffer 
we purchase technology from third parties that is incorporated into many of our products  including virtually all of our hardware products 
we order sole sourced components using purchase orders and do not have supply contracts for them 
one sole sourced component  a ti dsp chip  is particularly important to our business because it is included in virtually all of our hardware products 
if we were unable to purchase an adequate supply of these sole sourced components on a timely basis  we would be required to develop alternative products  which could entail qualifying an alternative source or redesigning our products based on different components 
our inability to obtain these sole sourced components  especially the ti dsp chip  could significantly delay shipment of our products  which could have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on resellers to promote  sell  install and support our products  and their failure to do so may substantially reduce our sales and thus seriously harm our business 
we rely on resellers who can provide high quality sales and support services 
as with our distributors  we compete with other telecommunications systems providers for our resellers business as our resellers generally market competing products 
if a reseller promotes a competitor s products to the detriment of our products or otherwise fails to market our products and services effectively  we could lose market share 
in addition  the loss of a key reseller or the failure of resellers to provide adequate customer service could cause our business to suffer 
if we do not properly train our resellers to sell  install and service our products  our business will suffer 
software or hardware errors may seriously harm our business and damage our reputation  causing loss of customers and revenues 
users expect telephone systems to provide a high level of reliability 
our products are inherently complex and may have undetected software or hardware errors 
we have detected and may continue to detect errors and product defects in our installed base of products  new product releases and product upgrades 
end users may install  maintain and use our products improperly or for purposes for which they were not designed 
these problems may degrade or terminate the operation of our products  which could cause end users to lose telephone service  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  damage our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems 
any significant delay in the commercial introduction of our products due to errors or defects  any design modifications required to correct these errors or defects or any negative effect on customer satisfaction as a result of errors or defects could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any claims brought because of problems with our products or services could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently offer a one year hardware guarantee to end users 
if our products fail within the first year  we face replacement costs 
our insurance policies may not provide sufficient or any coverage should a claim be asserted 
in addition  our introduction of products and systems with reliability  quality or compatibility problems could result in reduced revenues  uncollectible accounts receivable  delays in collecting accounts receivable  warranties and additional costs 
our customers  end users or employees could find errors in our products and systems after we have begun to sell them  resulting in product redevelopment costs and loss of  or delay in  their acceptance by the markets in which we compete 
further  we may experience significant product returns in the future 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may face infringement issues that could harm our business by requiring us to license technology on unfavorable terms or temporarily or permanently cease sales of key products 
we may become parties to litigation in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex litigation are difficult to predict 
on september   vertical networks  inc filed suit against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california  alleging infringement of vertical networks us patents nos 
    and  on october   vertical networks amended its complaint to add allegations of infringement of us patents nos 
 and  vertical networks filed a second amended complaint on november  to identify our products and or activities that allegedly infringe the seven patents in suit 
vertical networks seeks a judgment of patent infringement and an award of damages  including treble damages for alleged willful infringement  and attorneys fees and costs 
we filed an answer and counterclaims for declaratory relief on december  on december   vertical networks filed its answer to our counterclaims 
vertical networks served its preliminary infringement contentions on us on april  and we served vertical networks our preliminary invalidity contentions on june  and july  to date  the parties have exchanged some discovery  but no depositions have been taken  and no motions are currently pending 
on october   the parties filed a stipulation to stay this action  pending the outcome of the reissue of some of the subject patents before the us patent and trademark office 
we believe we have strong defenses and arguments in this dispute and intend to vigorously litigate our position 
management s view is that any loss from this litigation is not probable or estimable 
more generally  litigation related to these types of claims may require us to acquire licenses under third party patents that may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we believe that an increasing portion of our revenues in the future will come from sales of software applications for our hardware products 
the software market traditionally has experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of developers intellectual property rights 
this activity is difficult to detect  and legal proceedings to enforce developers intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and substantial costs 
any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and competitive position 
our success depends  to a certain extent  upon our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark law  together with non disclosure and invention assignment agreements  to establish and protect the proprietary rights in the technology used in our products 
although we have filed patent applications  we are not certain that our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  or that any patents issued will provide commercially significant protection of our technology 
in addition  other individuals or companies may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information not covered by patents to which we own rights  may obtain access to our know how or may claim to have issued patents that prevent the sale of one or more of our products 
also  it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our proprietary information without our authorization 
further  the laws of some countries  such as those in japan  one of our target markets  may not adequately protect our intellectual property or such protection may be uncertain 
our success also depends on trade secrets that cannot be patented and are difficult to protect 
if we fail to protect our proprietary information effectively  or if third parties use our proprietary technology without authorization  our competitive position and business will suffer 
our products may not meet the legal standards required for their sale in some countries  if we cannot sell our products in these countries  our results of operations may be seriously harmed 
the united states and other countries in which we intend to sell our products have standards for safety and other certifications that must be met for our products to be legally sold in those countries 
we have tried to design our products to meet the requirements of the countries where we sell or plan to sell them 
we also have obtained or are trying to obtain the certifications that we believe are required to sell our products in these countries 
we cannot  however  guarantee that our products meet all of these standards or that we will be able to obtain any certifications required 
in addition  there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the products we offer and may offer in the future 
these laws or regulations may include  for example  more stringent safety standards  requirements for additional or more burdensome certifications or more stringent consumer protection laws 
if our products do not meet a country s standards or we do not receive the certifications required by a country s laws or regulations  then we may not be able to sell our products in that country 
this inability to sell our products may seriously harm our results of operation by reducing our sales or requiring us to invest significant resources to conform our products to these standards 
our market is subject to changing preferences  failure to keep up with these changes would result in our losing market share  thus seriously harming our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customers and end users expect frequent product introductions and have changing requirements for new products and features 
in order to be competitive  therefore  we need to develop and market new products and product enhancements that respond to these changing requirements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our failure to do so promptly and cost effectively would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  introducing new products could require us to write off existing inventory as obsolete  which could harm our results of operations 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services 
we may seek additional funding in the future 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
we also may be required to reduce operating costs through lay offs or reduce our sales and marketing or research and development efforts 
if we issue equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our business will suffer 
we may not be successful in managing our future growth 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception 
in order to manage this expansion and grow in the future  we will need to expand or enhance our management  manufacturing  research and development and sales and marketing capabilities 
we may not be able to hire the management  staff or other personnel required to do so 
we may not be able to install adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned operational systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
difficulties in installing and implementing new systems  procedures and controls may significantly burden our management and our internal resources 
delays in the implementation of new systems or operational disruptions when we transition to new systems would impair our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
lead times for materials and components used in the assembly of our products vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if orders do not match forecasts  we may have excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  which may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our planned expansion in international markets will involve new risks that our previous domestic operations have not prepared us to address  our failure to address these risks could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the fiscal year  approximately of our net revenues came from customers outside of the united states 
we intend to expand our international sales and marketing efforts 
our efforts are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks include tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  such as import or export licensing imposed by foreign countries  especially on technology  potential adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could make our products relatively more expensive in foreign markets  and conflicting regulatory requirements in different countries that may require us to invest significant resources customizing our products for each country 
we depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business  our failure to promptly attract and retain qualified personnel may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  particularly engineers and sales and marketing personnel 
we need highly trained technical personnel to design and support our server based telecommunications systems 
in addition  we need highly trained sales and marketing personnel to expand our marketing and sales operations in order to increase market awareness of our products and generate increased revenues 
competition for highly trained personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area where most of our operations are located 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in our recruitment and retention efforts 
if we fail to attract or retain qualified personnel or suffer from delays in hiring required personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
our facility is vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters and other business interruptions  any such damage could seriously or completely impair our business 
we perform final assembly  software installation and testing of our products at our facility in fremont  california 
our facility is located on or near known earthquake fault zones and may be subject to rolling electrical blackouts and is vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
if such a disaster or interruption occurs  our ability to perform final assembly  software installation and testing of our products at our facility would be seriously  if not completely  impaired 
if we were unable to obtain an alternative place or way to perform these functions  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions 
our strategy to outsource assembly and test functions in the future could delay delivery of products  decrease quality or increase costs 
based on volume or customer requirements  we may begin outsourcing some assembly and test functions 
in addition  we may determine that we need to establish assembly and test operations overseas to better serve our international customers 
establishing overseas assembly and test operations may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
this outsourcing strategy involves certain risks  including the potential lack of adequate capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yield  quality and costs 
in the event that any significant subcontractors were to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or test our products in the required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
finding replacements could take time and we cannot be sure that additional sources would be available to us on a timely basis 
any delay or increase in costs in the assembly and testing of products by third party subcontractors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with changing regulations of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  our board members  chief executive officer  and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm our business 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
if  as of the end of our fiscal year  we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  or if our auditors are unable to confirm our assessment  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock price and our business could be adversely affected 
we are in the process of documenting  and plan to test during the current fiscal year  our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
commencing with september   the end of our fiscal year  the sarbanes oxley act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments 
during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented  or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
effective internal controls are important to help produce reliable financial reports and to prevent financial fraud 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of our fiscal year  or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on our management s evaluation or on the effectiveness of the internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock and our business could be adversely affected 
fasb s adoption of statement r will cause  and changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause  adverse revenue fluctuations  affect our reported results of operations or how we conduct our business 
on october   fasb adopted statement r  share based payment  which will require us  starting in the third quarter of fiscal year  to measure compensation costs for all stock based compensation including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  as currently constructed at fair value and take a compensation charge equal to that value 
this statement will have a future effect on our net income 
also  a change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
other new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
this change to existing rules  future changes  if any  or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
risks related to the industry integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems may not achieve widespread acceptance 
the market for integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
businesses have invested substantial resources in the existing telecommunications infrastructure  including traditional private telephone systems  and may be unwilling to replace these systems in the near term or at all 
businesses also may be reluctant to adopt integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems because of their concern about the current limitations of data networks  including the internet 
for example  end users sometimes experience delays in receiving calls and reduced voice quality during calls when routing calls over data networks 
moreover  businesses that begin to route calls over the same networks that currently carry only their data also may experience these problems if the networks do not have sufficient capacity to carry all of these communications at the same time 
future regulation or legislation could harm our business or increase our cost of doing business 
in april  the federal communications commission submitted a report to congress stating that it may regulate certain internet services if it determines that such internet services are functionally equivalent to conventional telecommunications services 
the increasing growth of the voice over data network market and the popularity of supporting products and services  heighten the risk that national governments will seek to regulate the transmission of voice communications over networks such as the internet 
in addition  large telecommunications companies may devote substantial lobbying efforts to influence the regulation of this market so as to benefit their interests  which may be contrary to our interests 
these regulations may include  for example  assessing access or settlement charges  imposing tariffs or imposing regulations based on encryption concerns or the characteristics and quality of products and services 
future laws  legal decisions or regulations  as well as changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could require us to expend significant resources to comply with them 
in addition  these future events or changes may create uncertainty in our market that could reduce demand for our products 
evolving standards may delay our product introductions  increase our product development costs or cause end users to defer or cancel plans to purchase our products  any of which could adversely affect our business 
the standards in our market are still evolving 
these standards are designed to ensure that integrated  multifunction telecommunications products from different manufacturers can operate together 
some of these standards are proposed by other participants in our market  including some of our competitors  and include proprietary technology 
in recent years  these standards have changed  and new standards have been proposed  in response to developments in our market 
our failure to conform our products to existing or future standards may limit their acceptance by market participants 
we may not anticipate which standards will achieve the broadest acceptance in our market in the future  and we may take a significant amount of time and expense to adapt our products to these standards 
we also may have to pay additional royalties to developers of proprietary technologies that become standards in our market 
these delays and expenses may seriously harm our results of operations 
in addition  customers and users may defer or cancel plans to purchase our products due to concerns about the ability of our products to conform to existing standards or to adapt to new or changed standards  and this could seriously harm our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in cash equivalents and short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents and investments  we have concluded that a change in interest rates does not pose a material market risk to us
