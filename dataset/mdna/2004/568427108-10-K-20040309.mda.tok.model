see also forward looking statements above 
the board of directors  at their quarterly meeting on january   authorized a three for two stock split by the issuance on march  of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at february  accordingly  the par value of additional shares issued will be adjusted between common stock and capital in excess of par value  and fractional shares resulting from the stock split will be settled in cash 
all share and per share data have been retroactively adjusted for this split 
overview marine products corporation  through its wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
the company sells its products to a network of independent dealers who in turn sells the products to retail customers 
these dealers are located throughout the continental united states and in several international markets 
marine products business is impacted by economic conditions  consumer confidence  interest rates  the weather  and other factors 
the company s management believes that it has the opportunity to continue to enhance its customers boating experience by providing them with high quality  innovative powerboats  and thereby increase its market share  net sales  and net income 
marine products management is also focused on the competitive nature of the recreational powerboat manufacturing business and factors which may lead to a decline in consumer confidence or consumers discretionary income  both of which could negatively impact sales of the company s powerboats 
outlook management believes that net sales and profits will continue to increase in  based on the projections of continued low interest rates and improving economic conditions 
this belief is also based on reports of attendance and sales during the winter retail boat show season  which began in december media reports regarding recent boat shows indicate that attendance has increased by as much as percent compared to last year  although several shows reported decreased attendance due to inclement weather 
boat show attendance has historically been positively correlated with retail boat sales later in the selling season because consumers attend shows due to their interest in recreational boating and make purchasing decisions at a boat show 
however  there can be no assurance that this relationship will continue in or subsequent years 
pleasure boating is a discretionary consumer expenditure  therefore  an increase in interest rates or decline in consumer confidence due to a weakening economy or renewed global conflict would have a serious and immediate negative impact on sales and profits 
at the present time  marine products corporation as well as other manufacturers are refining and improving their customer service capabilities  marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers to recreational boating as well as improve consumers boating experiences 
management believes that these efforts may result in increased marketing and other selling  general and administrative expenses in the future 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
recognition of sales the company sells its boats through its international network of independent dealers 
although sales orders are cancelable at any time  substantially all boats are pre sold to a dealer before entering the production line 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
accrued sales discounts the company s incentive programs include annual volume based discounts that promote early replenishment of dealer inventories after the spring and summer peak selling seasons and help to level out manufacturing volumes throughout the year 
these discounts are based on the dealer purchase volumes for the period july through june of the following year 
the company monitors dealer purchases and uses its judgment to determine an appropriate dealer discount reserve 
in addition  the company selectively creates retail sales incentive programs 
the company records these estimated sales discounts at the later of the recognition of sales or the announcement of an incentive program 
these estimates are based upon the company s assessment of the volume of sales that will qualify for each program 
our future financial results will be impacted by any differences between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle these liabilities 
dealer floor plan interest the company provides an option to pay a qualifying dealer s incurred floor plan interest costs on current model year inventory held during specified periods of time instead of additional cash discounts 
the costs to be paid by the company will vary depending upon the dollar amount and length of time the dealer maintains the inventory as well as variations in interest rates charged by the floor plan financing companies 
at the time the boat sales are recognized  the company records an experience based estimate of the future interest costs to be incurred 
while the company believes the recorded floor plan interest reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated amounts could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our future financial results will be impacted by any differences between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle these liabilities 
warranty accruals the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull 
warranty costs  if any  on other components of the boats are absorbed by the original manufacturer 
the warranty periods vary by component  but extend up to ten years 
at the time the boat sales are recognized  the company records an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred on boats sold 
while the company believes the recorded warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated amounts could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
prospective financial results will be impacted by any differences between these estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle these liabilities 
accrued insurance liabilities the company has exposure to various contingent liabilities and future claims 
the company self insures  up to specified limits  its employee health insurance plan costs 
the cost of claims under this self insurance program is estimated and accrued as the claims are incurred although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods 
these claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims 
to estimate the ultimate cost of the claims  the company uses its historical experience  and where appropriate  the advice of outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  future financial results will be impacted by the difference between these estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle the liabilities 
pension liabilities pension expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
pension costs are actuarially determined on an annual basis and affected by assumptions including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company utilizes the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield as a basis for determining the discount rate with a yield adjustment made for the longer duration of the company s obligations 
the company evaluates its assumption regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations with respect to investment returns and asset allocations 
the company chooses a rate of return on plan assets that it believes is an appropriate long term average return 
the expected return on plan assets takes into account estimated future investment returns for various asset classes held in the plans portfolio 
to the extent changes are required in the assumptions discussed above  the company s recorded liabilities may have to be adjusted and may result in a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of the company 
results of operations s in thousands total number of boats sold    average selling price per boat net sales    percentage of cost of goods sold to net sales percentage of selling  general and administrative expense to net sales operating income    research and development expense    warranty expense    year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
marine products net sales increased by  or percent in compared to the increase was primarily due to an percent increase in units sold  as well as a percent increase in the average sales price of boats sold 
the increases in units sold were realized primarily in the chaparral sportboat and cruiser lines  and in the robalo sport fishing boat line 
the increase in average sales prices resulted from increased sales of larger cruisers  increased robalo unit sales  and overall price increases that were implemented for the model year  which began in july the net sales increase was also due to higher parts and accessories sales  which is a result of the increasing numbers of boats sold in prior years that are still in operation and require routine maintenance and repair 
management believes that in general  the increase in unit volume during the year resulted from favorable economic and industry conditions  including continued low interest rates  an improving domestic economy  and a trend in which consumers choose recreational activities that are safe  close to home  and can be enjoyed in a controlled environment with family and friends 
the available industry statistics also indicate that chaparral continued to gain market share in the to foot sterndrive pleasure boat market during  which management believes is due to increased industry recognition of the company s product quality  enhanced dealer incentive and training programs  and new boat models with designs and features that have broader consumer appeal 
the robalo unit sales increased by percent  due to an expanded model offering including larger sizes and more available design options  which led to broader dealer acceptance of the robalo line and ultimately increased sales volumes 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased percent to  in compared to  in  an increase of  consistent with the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from to  because of efficiencies gained from higher production volumes  especially within the robalo line  and an overall shift in model mix to larger boats which typically generate higher margins

selling  general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or percent 
the company continued to create some expense leverage with higher net sales 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from costs that vary with increased sales and profitability  such as incentive compensation  sales commissions and warranty expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in research and development expense  related to less new model design activities in compared to when the company performed a large cruiser design project and several projects to expand the robalo line 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased because the incentive compensation and sales commission expenses were higher due to the increase in gross profit margin and operating margin percents 
marine products provides a five year transferable hull structural warranty on chaparral products against defects in material and workmanship and a year transferable structural hull warranty on robalo products

based on available industry statistics  chaparral has continued to gain market share 
the net sales increase in compared to resulted primarily from a percent increase in the volume of boats sold coupled with a percent increase in the average sales price per unit 
management believes that the increase in unit volume was partially related to the american consumers decision to pursue recreational activities closer to home due to political and economic uncertainty 
the increase in the average sales price resulted from an increase in the number of larger cruisers  sportboats  and deckboats sold during the year in combination with the elimination of our lowest price line of boats  the chaparral sse

the company s operations historically have generated sufficient cash for its operations and the excess was transferred to rpc 
in connection with the spin off from rpc  the company received  in cash and marketable securities from rpc 
the company is now able to retain any excess cash it generates  however  in the event capital is needed to fund operations  capital expenditures or acquisitions  it is no longer able to rely upon the capital resources of rpc 
cash provided by operations increased during by  compared to the increase was due to higher operating income in compared to  partially offset by higher working capital requirements at december  due to an increase in accounts receivable correlated with higher sales and related manufacturing activities  and an increase in income taxes receivable  together with decreases in accounts payable and income tax payable that were caused by timing differences in payments
