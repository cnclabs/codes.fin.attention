our revenues and expenses are affected by the number and timing of additional restaurant openings and the sales volumes of both existing and new restaurants 
effective november   checkers and rally s entered into a management services agreement agreement whereby checkers provided accounting  technology  and other functional and management services to predominantly all of the operations of rally s 
checkers received fees from rally s relative to the shared departmental costs times the respective restaurant ratio

franchise fees and other income franchise fees and other income increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily the result of franchise fees received in for the sale of restaurants between the company and a new franchisee in fiscal year restaurant food and paper costs restaurant food and paper costs totaled million or of restaurant sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal the increase in these costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to increased beef and cheese prices during the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year  net of increased volume rebates for soda syrup 
restaurant labor costs restaurant labor costs  which include restaurant employees salaries  wages  benefits  workers compensation costs  bonuses and related taxes totaled million or of restaurant sales for fiscal compared with million or for fiscal the decrease in restaurant labor costs as a percentage of restaurant sales compared to the prior year was due to the increase in restaurant same store sales  as well as a benefit from a decrease in workers compensation expense experienced in workers compensation costs as a percentage of sales decreased by basis points for as compared to  attributed primarily to favorable claims development 
restaurant occupancy expense restaurant occupancy expense  which includes rent  property taxes  licenses and insurance  was million or of restaurant sales in compared with million or of restaurant sales in the decrease in restaurant occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant sales is due primarily to the increase in comparable restaurant sales 
restaurant depreciation restaurant depreciation totaled million or of restaurant sales for fiscal compared to million or for fiscal the decrease was due primarily to the increase in same store sales growth and the result of million in impairments for under performing locations in and million in impairments in such impairments reduced the depreciable bases and depreciation expense on these assets 
this decrease was partially offset by depreciation on million of capital additions and restaurant assets acquired during other restaurant operating expenses other restaurant operating expense includes all other restaurant level operating expenses  and specifically includes utilities  repairs and maintenance and other costs 
these expenses totaled million  or of restaurant sales for the year ended december  compared to million  or of restaurant sales for the year ended december  repairs and maintenance decreased to as a percentage of restaurant sales for compared to for utilities increased slightly to in as compared to in as a percentage of restaurant sales 
other costs in this category remained relatively constant at as a percentage of restaurant sales as compared to in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues for fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues for fiscal these costs have increased due to increased professional fees for income tax related matters and legal costs to protect the company s trademarks and rights in the current year 

table of contents advertising advertising expense was million or of restaurant sales in fiscal as compared to million  or of restaurant sales for the increase was due primarily to increased spending on media for the motor sports initiative which began in the second quarter of impairment of long lived assets during fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges of million 
these impairments were for obsolete equipment and assets located at restaurants based upon the review of their current and projected operating results 
during  the company recognized million in impairment charges 
during  the company completed an evaluation of properties held for sale by obtaining appraisals on land and buildings for six locations which resulted in an impairment of million 
likewise  an impairment of million was necessary to reflect fair market value of non standard modular buildings and equipment held for sale 
an additional million charge was recognized for restaurant buildings in new orleans  which management initiated plans during to replace in the company also reviewed historical and projected cash flows of all operating restaurants and recorded impairment charges for under performing restaurants of million 
restaurant retirement costs during fiscal  the company recognized a benefit of million  resulting from management s successful negotiation out of lease obligations previously reserved for 
during  the company recognized charges of million from restaurant closures related to the estimated future cost of surplus properties 
the company remains obligated to make ongoing lease payments on vacant sites and other sites which are subleased for less than the company s lease cost 
gain on sale of assets during fiscal  the company recognized a gain of million from the sale of assets 
this gain was primarily due to the sale of restaurants in the california  phoenix and nashville markets to a new franchisee during the fourth quarter of income tax the company s income tax benefit represents current taxes of approximately  and a deferred tax benefit of approximately  the company recognized a reduction of million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in  for which million was recorded as a reduction of goodwill 
the valuation allowance was reduced because the company believes that the deferred tax assets will be realized  resulting from its current operating success  coupled with our future positive outlook 
the company s income tax expense represented current state income taxes 
comparison of historical results fiscal years and restaurant sales total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  company owned restaurant sales increased by million for the year  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal the primary reason for the increase was the addition of restaurants during fiscal and the full year of revenues for restaurants acquired during fiscal restaurants added during the current year accounted for approximately million of the increase while restaurants acquired in accounted for approximately million of the increase 
the increase in revenues from these additional restaurants was partially offset by the closure or sale of restaurants and negative year over year comparable sales of for fiscal franchise royalty revenue franchise royalties decreased by million as compared to primarily as a result of the decrease in franchise restaurant locations during fiscal as compared to fiscal the acquisition of franchise restaurants by the company during both and  and a decrease in year over year comparable sales of at franchise locations also contributed to the decrease in royalties 
franchise fees and other income franchise fees and other income decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of franchise fees received in for the transfer of approximately restaurants between franchisees in fiscal year restaurant food and paper costs restaurant food and paper costs totaled million or of restaurant sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal the decrease in these costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to decreased beef and cheese prices during the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year in addition  gross margin for the promotional campaigns run in fiscal year were more favorable to the company compared to the promotions that ran in fiscal year restaurant labor costs restaurant labor costs  which include restaurant employees salaries  wages  benefits  workers compensation costs  bonuses and related taxes totaled million or of restaurant sales for fiscal compared with million or for fiscal 
table of contents the staffing at our restaurants was increased significantly subsequent to the merger of checkers drive in restaurants  inc and rally s hamburgers  inc on august  this was approximately the same time new management began running the combined company 
at the time of the merger  the restaurants were understaffed and several were without managers 
management s initial goal was to increase staffing levels in an effort to reduce service time and increase customer satisfaction 
by the end of  the restaurants were deemed adequately staffed and management then began to focus on properly managing the labor costs 
a labor management matrix  primarily based upon sales  was created for the company and labor cost management was added to the restaurant manager performance evaluations 
as a result  the cost of management labor and direct labor as a percentage of sales decreased basis points for as compared to workers compensation costs as a percentage of sales increased by basis points for as compared to the increase in workers compensation costs was due to an increase in the estimated loss per claim for claims in based upon the independent actuarial report  and an increase in estimated total losses on claims for years prior to based upon the same actuarial report 
restaurant occupancy expense restaurant occupancy expense  which includes rent  property taxes  licenses and insurance totaled million or of restaurant sales in compared with million or in the decrease in restaurant occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant sales is due primarily to the increase in comparable restaurant sales in the california market by for six comparable periods of  and the increase in comparable restaurant sales in the macon  ga market by for five comparable periods of  although total company year over year comparable sales decreased in restaurant depreciation restaurant depreciation and amortization totaled million or of restaurant sales for fiscal compared to million or for fiscal the increase was the result of management s plan to continue to operate company owned restaurants which were originally forecasted to be sold as part of the restructuring plan 
the assets at these locations were reclassified from held for sale to held for use at december  as a result  we began recording depreciation on these assets during fiscal year the increase in depreciation was also due to capital additions during fiscal year other restaurant operating expenses other restaurant operating expense includes all other restaurant level operating expenses  and specifically includes utilities  repairs and maintenance and other costs 
these expenses totaled million  or of restaurant sales for the year ended december  compared to million  or of restaurant sales for the year ended december  repairs and maintenance  the largest component of this category  increased to as a percentage of restaurant sales for compared to for utilities remained consistent at as a percentage of restaurant sales for and  whereas other costs increased to as a percentage of restaurant sales for compared to for the increase in the category was attributed to additional repairs and maintenance as we continue to improve and refurbish the restaurants  additional expenses incurred for maintenance agreements on new pos equipment rolled out during the course of the prior year  as well as increased utilities in acquired company restaurants 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues for fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues for fiscal these costs have decreased as a percentage of total revenues due to their relatively fixed nature and increased revenues 
advertising advertising expense increased approximately million to million  or of restaurant sales for compared with for the increase was due to an increase in the average number of company owned restaurants operated during fiscal as compared to fiscal  incremental marketing to spur sales and increase brand awareness in regions where the company began operating restaurants which were previously franchise only regions  and additional outlays to roll out soft serve treats 
other depreciation and amortization other depreciation and amortization decreased by million to million 
the decrease was due to the adoption of sfas no 
for intangible assets on january  as a result  the goodwill and tradename carried on the books of the company are no longer amortized 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill and tradename as of january  based upon the review  no impairment charge was required 
amortization for goodwill and the tradename amounted to approximately million for the remaining decrease was attributed to locations acquired in july  which were operated by a franchisee under a separate operating agreement 
depreciation for these locations was classified as other depreciation while operated by the franchisee 
as they are now company owned  it is classified as restaurant depreciation 
impairment of long lived assets during  the company recognized million in impairment charges 
the company completed an evaluation of properties held for sale by obtaining appraisals on land and buildings for six locations which resulted in an impairment of million 

table of contents likewise  an impairment of million was necessary to reflect fair market value of non standard modular buildings and equipment held for sale 
an additional million charge was recognized for restaurant buildings in new orleans  which management initiated plans during to replace in the company also reviewed historical and projected cash flows of all operating restaurants and recorded impairment charges for under performing restaurants of million 
during fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges of million 
restaurant retirement costs during  the company recognized charges totaling million from restaurant closures related to the estimated future cost of surplus properties 
this charge represents only properties held under operating leases 
the company remains directly obligated to make lease payments on vacant sites plus other sites which are subleased for amounts less than the company s original lease obligation 
while the lease agreements do allow for subleasing  they do not allow for cancellation 
after significant efforts by the company to sublease the remaining vacant sites with minimal progress  the lease accrual was increased to reflect our best estimate of our remaining obligations under the leases  generally representing the remaining payments under their minimum lease obligations 
during fiscal  the company recognized losses of million from restaurant closures 
income tax the company s income tax expense represents income taxes assessed at the state level for states which the company does not have any net operating losses available or the state has suspended the use of net operating losses during the company s income tax expense represented federal alternative minimum tax based upon estimated federal alternative minimum taxable income after utilizing the allowable portion of our net operating loss carryforwards  prior to the jobs creation and workers assistance act of a valuation allowance was provided for percent of the net deferred tax assets in the benefit related to the net deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and credit carryforwards will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense and goodwill when realization is more likely than not to occur 
liquidity and capital resources the restaurant industry  in general  operates with a working capital deficit because most of our investments are in long term restaurant operating assets 
we do not normally require large amounts of working capital to maintain operations since sales are for cash  purchases are on open accounts and meat and produce inventories are limited to a three to five day supply to assure freshness 
we do not have significant levels of accounts receivable or inventory  and receive credit from our trade suppliers 
funds available from cash sales not needed immediately to pay our trade suppliers are generally used for non current capital expenditures or invested in high quality short term investments 
we have working capital of million at december  as compared to million at december  this change was primarily due to the decrease in the the valuation allowance on current deferred tax assets of million  the reduction of accounts payable for food and paper purchases by million to take advantage of vendor term discounts offered  and the decrease of million in accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of our real estate tax payments 
the company is subject to certain restrictive financial and non financial covenants under certain of its debt agreements  including ebitda and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants for fiscal year the company obtained a credit facility with us bancorp equipment finance  inc in that allows it to borrow up to million  which is available through december  the agreement allows the company to borrow at plus the year interest rate swap published in the federal reserve statistical release 
during fiscal year  the company had received separate commitments from two lenders for financing 
the commitments were for obligations up to million in the aggregate for property development 
the credit facility with merrill lynch was available through october  with an interest rate equal to the year swap rate plus basis points 
the credit facility with cnl franchise network  lp cnl was available through december  the agreement committed cnl to enter into a sale leaseback transaction for properties to be developed and operated by the company as checkers or rally s restaurants 
both commitments expired under their original terms 
there were no borrowings or sale leaseback transactions under these facilities as of december  cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately million to million since the fiscal year ended december  cash flow provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year current year operating cash flows are largely attributable to current profits net of non cash expenses  a decrease in outstanding notes receivable  offset by an increase to accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash flow used for investing activities was million and related primarily to capital expenditures at existing restaurants  the construction of three new restaurants and the acquisition of restaurants and one equity interest for a joint venture restaurant from 
table of contents former franchisees  net of proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment in the current year 
cash used by financing activities was million 
over the past two years we have paid down million in outstanding debt 
in fiscal  we paid down principal of million on outstanding debt 
in fiscal  we paid down million of debt  along with other principal payments of million 
the company purchased treasury stock for million and increased restricted cash by million 
these outlays were offset against receipts of million from the exercise of stock options during the year ended december  we continue to evaluate the company s capital structure and refinancing opportunities 
we have capital lease receivables for certain restaurants previously sold which are subject to capital lease and mortgage obligations for which we continue to be the primary obligor  and have equivalent liabilities recorded 
the amount of capital lease receivables as of december  was approximately million 
the company  as original lessee  has also subleased certain land associated with the sale of company owned restaurants under operating leases 
the revenue from these subleases is offset against rent expense  as we continue to be responsible for the rent payments to the original lessors 
sublease rental income recorded for december   december  and december   was million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to total million 
these expenditures include the development of new restaurants  the remodeling of existing restaurants as well as other capital equipment and improvements on operating restaurants 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that our existing cash at december   the expected cash provided from operations  and the available million credit facility with us bancorp equipment finance  inc will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financials statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions we consider reasonable at the time of making those estimates 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or using different assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition franchise fees and area development franchise fees are generated from the sale of rights to develop  own and operate restaurants 
such fees are based on the number of potential restaurants in a specific area which the franchisee agrees to develop pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement between the company and the franchisee and are recognized as income when substantially all of the company s obligations per location are satisfied generally at the opening of the restaurant 
franchise fees are nonrefundable 
franchise fees and area development franchise fees received prior to substantial completion of the company s obligations are deferred 
the company receives royalty fees from franchisees based on a percentage of each restaurant s gross revenues 
royalty fees are recognized as earned 
gains associated with the sale of certain company owned restaurants to franchisees with associated mortgages and capital leases are recognized over the life of the related capital leases 
during fiscal years and  several company owned restaurants were sold to franchisees with associated mortgages and capital leases 
as a result of the sales  we have recorded lease receivables for those restaurants sold which are subject to capital lease and mortgage obligations 
the amount of capital lease receivables as of december  was approximately million 
we have recorded deferred gains of million from these sales since we continue to be responsible for the payment of the obligations to the original lessors and mortgagors 
the deferred gains are included in our consolidated balance sheet under the captions accrued liabilities current and deferred revenues for million and million  respectively and will be recognized over the next years 
additionally  the company has deferred approximately million of gains in accordance with sfas no 
 where notes receivable were accepted as consideration for sales of certain company owned restaurants 
these notes as well as the associated deferred gains are scheduled to be collected and recognized over the term of the notes  which are due over the next years 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following offers from current or potential franchisees for restaurants below carrying value  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires the write down of certain intangibles and tangible property associated with under performing assets 
in applying sfas no 
 we reviewed historical and projected cash flows of all restaurants and performed a discounted cash flow analysis where indicated for each restaurant based upon such results projected over a ten year period 
this period of time was selected based upon the lease term and the age of the related buildings 
impairments or recoveries are recorded to adjust the asset values to the amount recoverable under the discounted cash flow analysis  in accordance with sfas no 
the effect of applying these standards resulted in a reduction of property  equipment and intangible assets of approximately million for the fiscal year  million for the fiscal year  and million for the fiscal year for further discussion  see note j summary of significant accounting policies valuation of long lived assets of the consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report on form k 
allowance for doubtful receivables management must make estimates of the collectability of our receivables 
management specifically analyzes its receivables and related historical bad debts  franchise concentrations  franchise credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
current portion of accounts  notes and leases receivable totaled million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  contingencies management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where a range of loss has been identified 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
restaurant retirement costs reserves for restaurant relocations and abandoned sites consist of our estimates for the ongoing costs of each location which has been closed or was never developed 
those costs include rent  property taxes  costs associated with relocating the modular restaurant to a storage facility  and any other retirement costs 
the cash outlays for these costs have been estimated for the remaining terms of the lease obligations  ranging from less than year to years 
although the company has negotiated out of several of these sites  the current economic outlook and lack of alternative investment opportunities have hindered the company s ability to successfully negotiate out of the remaining sites 
as a result  management believes that cash outlays for these sites will continue through lease maturity 
during fiscal  the company recognized a benefit of million from successfully negotiating out of certain lease obligations 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes

realization of the deferred tax benefits is dependant on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
the deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided for as necessary 
during  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance 
as of december  the company has deferred tax assets available to reduce future income taxes 
currently there is a valuation allowance of million recorded against approximately million of the net deferred tax assets 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of intangible assets on an annual basis  including such assets as franchise rights  tradename and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and million for the intangible value of our tradename in fiscal we recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization for and in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill and tradename as of january  subsequently  we performed annual impairment reviews on december  and december  based upon these reviews  no impairment was required  and we do not believe circumstances have changed since the review date which would 
table of contents make it necessary to reassess their values subsequent to the balance sheet date 
we will continue our annual evaluation  unless circumstances call for us to perform an evaluation prior to then 
the company recorded an adjustment to goodwill in fiscal of million  reducing goodwill to million in conjunction with the reduction to the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets 
new accounting standards in november  fasb interpretation no

risks factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the following risk factors and others that we may add from time to time  are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements 
we may experience operating losses if we cannot sustain our current sales volume 
in fiscal and prior to fiscal  we had net losses for the previous four years 
while we had net income of   and million for fiscal   and  respectively  we cannot assure you that we will not have a loss for the current fiscal year which will end on january  our prior years losses were primarily caused by impairment charges related to lower restaurant sales at certain restaurants during these periods  and these losses may occur again if we are unable to sustain our current level of sales 
our available cash is limited by our debt service obligations 
at december   we had outstanding long term debt and capital lease obligations of approximately million  pursuant to which we are required to make principal  interest and lease payments 
during fiscal  we paid million in interest on our long term debt 
our debt service and capital lease obligations limit our available cash flow 
our debt and lease agreements contain financial covenants 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial and non financial covenants under certain of our debt and lease agreements  including ebitda and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
though we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants at december   if we are unable to make the required interest payments or to comply with the provisions of our debt covenants  our creditors may accelerate the due date of our debt and foreclose upon the operating assets we used to secure these obligations 
any such actions would adversely affect our operations and strain our cash flow 

table of contents we may incur substantial liability arising from lawsuits to which we are a party 
we are parties to the litigation described in item note d commitments and contingencies litigation  in this filing 
although we cannot determine at this time the outcome of the lawsuits to which we are a party  if the result in one or more of the cases is adverse to us  the potential liability could be material 
in addition  we believe that the costs of defending these actions could be significant 
the litigation matters include disputes with our franchisees and include claims of fraud and violations of state franchise laws  and a securities class action 
there are many risks associated with the food services industry 
the food service industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional  and local economic conditions  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number  and location of competing restaurants 
food service chains can also be adversely affected by publicity resulting from food quality  illness  injury or other health concerns including food borne illness claims stemming from one store or a limited number of stores 
claims relating to foreign objects or food borne illness are common in the food services industry and a number of such claims may exist at any given time 
dependence on frequent deliveries of produce and supplies also subjects food service businesses such as ours to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability  quality  and cost of ingredients 
in addition  material changes in  or our failure to comply with  applicable federal  state  and local government regulations  and factors such as inflation  increased food  labor  and employee benefits costs  regional weather conditions and the availability of an adequate number of experienced managers and hourly employees may also adversely affect the food service industry in general and our results of operations and financial condition 
the quick service restaurant industry is intensely competitive and our operating results may be adversely affected by our need to adjust our operations to meet this competition 
there is intense competition in the quick service restaurant industry which has adversely affected us 
we expect to continue to experience intense competition  especially from the major chains  which have substantially greater financial resources and longer operating histories then us  and dominate the quick service restaurant industry 
we compete primarily on the basis of food quality  price and speed of service 
a significant change in pricing or other marketing strategies by one or more of our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our sales  earnings and growth 
in order to compete with each other  all of the major quick service chains have increasingly offered selected food items and combination meals at discounted prices 
we anticipate that the major quick service hamburger chains will continue to offer promotions of value priced meals  many specifically targeting the 
price point at which we sell many of our products 
as a result  we cannot rely on low prices to give us a competitive advantage 
our growth strategy is dependent upon franchisees 
as of december   restaurants were operated by us  and were operated by franchisees 
our growth strategy will continue to be heavily dependent upon the opening of new stores owned by franchisees  and the manner in which they operate and develop their restaurants to promote and develop our concepts and our reputation for quality food and speed of service 
the opening and success of stores is dependent on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable sites  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for such sites  permitting and regulatory compliance  the ability to hire and train qualified personnel  the financial and other capabilities of our franchisees and area developers  and general economic and business conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control or the control of our franchisees and area developers 
we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control 
franchisees are generally independent operators and are not our employees 
we provide training and support to franchisees  but the quality of franchised store operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control 
consequently  area developers and individual franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements  or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel 
if they do not  our image and reputation may suffer  and systemwide sales could decline 
the ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel is extremely important and our failure to do so could adversely affect us 
we are heavily dependent upon the services of our officers and key management involved in restaurant operations  marketing  finance  purchasing  expansion  human resources and administration 
the loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
other than our chief executive officer and vice president of operations  we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our employees 
our success is also dependent upon our franchisee s ability to attract and maintain a sufficient number of qualified managers and other restaurant employees 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some geographic areas 
the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may result in higher employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents our resources may be strained by implementing our business strategy 
our growth strategy may place a strain on our management  financial and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must maintain the level of quality and service at our existing and future restaurants 
we must also continue to enhance our operations  financial and management systems and locate  hire  train and retain experienced and dedicated operating personnel  particularly restaurant managers 
we may not be able to effectively manage any one or more of these aspects of our expansion 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to anticipate and react to our food and labor costs  our profitability could be adversely affected 
our stores operating costs consist principally of food and labor costs 
our profitability is dependent in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and labor costs 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions and governmental regulation  may affect our food costs 
we may not be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs  whether through purchasing practices  menu composition or menu price adjustment in the future 
in the event that food or labor price increases cause us to increase our menu prices  we face the risk that our customers will choose our competitors if their prices are lower 
failure to react to changing food costs  or retaining customers if we are forced to raise menu prices  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our ability to develop new franchised stores and to enforce contractual rights against franchisees may be adversely affected by franchise laws and regulations  which could cause our franchise revenues to decline and adversely affect our growth strategy 
as a franchisor  we are subject to regulation by both the federal trade commission and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
our failure to obtain or maintain approvals to sell franchises would cause us to lose franchise revenues 
if we are unable to sell new franchises  we will not be able to accomplish our growth strategy 
in addition  state laws that regulate substantive aspects of our relationships with franchisees may limit our ability to terminate or otherwise resolve conflicts with our franchisees 
because we plan to grow primarily through franchising  any impairment of our ability to develop new franchised stores will negatively affect us and our growth strategy more than if we planned to develop additional company stores 
our quarterly results may fluctuate and could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly and yearly results have varied in the past  and we believe that our quarterly operating results will vary in the future 
for this reason  you should not rely upon our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance 
in some future periods  our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall 
factors such as seasonality and unanticipated increases in labor  food  insurance or other operating costs may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate 
you should not rely on our same store sales as an indication of our future results of operations because they may fluctuate significantly 
a number of factors have historically affected  and will continue to affect  our same store sales results 
such factors include unusually strong sales performance by new stores operated at least one year  competition  regional and national economic conditions  consumer trends  and our ability to execute our business strategy effectively 
significant fluctuations could result in lower than planned sales  adversely impacting our profitability goals and straining cash flow 
future sales of shares of our common stock could decrease its market price 
as of february   we had  shares of our common stock outstanding and grants of options outstanding to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
possible or actual sales of any of these shares under rule or otherwise  may in the future decrease the price of shares of our common stock 
our largest stockholders still have a significant influence on matters put to a vote 
the percentage interest held by our largest shareholders may have significant influence on elections of directors and other matters put to a vote of stockholders 
ownership percentages of such large shareholders can be found under the heading security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management in the company s definitive proxy statement to be used in connection with the company s annual meeting of stockholders  which will be filed with the commission on or before april  item a 
quantitive and qualit ive disclosures about market risks interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations our exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes and availability could have on our debt 
borrowings under our primary debt facilities and capital lease obligations bear interest ranging from to 
an increase in short term and long term interest rates would result in a reduction of pre tax earnings 
substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the company and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 

table of contents commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within the company s control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements have been negotiated in advance to minimize price volatility 
typically  the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  the company believes it will be able to address commodity cost increases  which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting its menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower restaurant level operating margins
