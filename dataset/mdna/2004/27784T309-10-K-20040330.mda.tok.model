item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this form k 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset or otherwise reduce all or any of the cancellation of debt income resulting from the elimination of debt pursuant to our debt restructuring 
if we do not succeed in substantially increasing our revenues  our losses may recur 
we may need to raise capital in the future to invest in the growth of our business and to fund necessary expenditures 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
see part i 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our principal fixed commitments consist of subordinated convertible notes  senior convertible notes  notes payable  obligations under capital leases  obligations under office space leases  accounts payable and other current obligations  commitments for capital expenditures and commitments for telecommunications services 
for each of the four years ended december    and  we received a report from our independent accountants containing an explanatory paragraph stating that we suffered recurring losses from operations since inception and have a working capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we may need additional financing to invest in the growth of our business and to pay other obligations  and the availability of such financing when needed  on terms acceptable to us  or at all  is uncertain 
see risk factors we have incurred significant indebtedness for money borrowed  and we may be unable to pay debt service on this indebtedness 
if we are unable to raise additional financing  generate sufficient cash flow  or restructure our debt obligations before they become due and payable  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities  stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest 
the amount of dilution resulting from issuance of additional shares of class a common stock and securities convertible into class a common stock and the potential dilution that may result from future issuances has significantly increased in light of the decline in our stock price 
moreover  we could issue preferred stock that has rights senior to those of the class a common stock 
some of our stockholders have registration rights that could interfere with our ability to raise needed capital 
if we raise funds by issuing debt  our lenders may place limitations on our operations  including our ability to pay dividends  although we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future 
we have incurred significant indebtedness for money borrowed  and we may be unable to pay debt service on this indebtedness 
as of december   we had outstanding million in subordinated convertible notes due in  million in principal amount of notes and other obligations due in installments through june   obligations under office space leases  and commitments for telecommunications services 
we currently have million in principal and interest  including capitalized interest  payments due during the twelve month period after december  we had an operating loss and negative cash flow for each of the years ended december  and in addition  we have a substantial amount of outstanding accounts payable and other obligations 
accordingly  cash generated by our operations would have been insufficient to pay the amount of principal and interest payable annually on our outstanding indebtedness or to pay our other obligations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay interest and other amounts due on our outstanding indebtedness  or our other obligations  on the scheduled dates or at all 
if our cash flow and cash balances are inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we otherwise fail to comply with any covenants in our indebtedness  we would be in default under these obligations  which would permit these lenders to accelerate the maturity of the obligations and could cause defaults under our indebtedness 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due on our indebtedness if payment of the indebtedness were accelerated following the occurrence of an event of default under  or certain other events specified in  the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and capital leases 
the elimination of outstanding debt pursuant to our debt restructuring completed in and prior years resulted in substantial cancellation of debt income for income tax purposes 
we intend to minimize income tax payable as a result of the restructuring by  among other things  offsetting the income with our historical net operating losses and otherwise reducing the income in accordance with applicable income tax rules 
as result  we do not expect to incur any material current income tax liability as a result of the elimination of this debt 
however  the relevant tax authorities may challenge our income tax positions  including the use of our historical net operating losses to offset some or all of the cancellation of debt income and the application of the income tax rules reducing the cancellation of debt income 
if we are not able to offset or otherwise reduce the cancellation of debt income  we may incur material income tax liabilities as a result of the elimination of debt and we may be unable to pay these liabilities 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness  make it difficult to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
where resources permit  we intend to continue to acquire  or make strategic investments in  other businesses and acquire or license technology and other assets and we may have difficulty integrating these businesses or generating an acceptable return 
we have completed a number of acquisitions and strategic investments since our initial public offering 
for example  we acquired netmoves corporation  a provider of production messaging services and integrated desktop messaging services to businesses 
we also acquired swift telecommunications  inc and the easylink services business that it had contemporaneously acquired from at t corp 
where resources permit  we will continue our efforts to acquire or make strategic investments in businesses and to acquire or license technology and other assets  and any of these acquisitions may be material to us 
we cannot assure you that acquisition or licensing opportunities will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
such acquisitions involve risks  including inability to raise the required capital  difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and personnel  inability to retain any acquired member or customer accounts  disruption of our ongoing business  the need for additional capital to fund losses of acquired businesses  inability to successfully incorporate acquired technology into our service offerings and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and lack of the necessary experience to enter new markets 
we may not successfully overcome problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by diluting our stockholders equity  causing us to incur additional debt or requiring us to incur acquisition expenses or amortize or depreciate acquired intangible and tangible assets or to incur impairment charges as a result of the write off of goodwill recorded as a result of such acquisition 
we may be unable to successfully complete the migration of the network relating to our business acquired from at t off of at t premises 
on february   we completed the acquisition of swift telecommunications  inc which had contemporaneously acquired the easylink services business of at t corp 
the easylink services business acquired from at t provides a variety of transaction delivery services 
this business was a division of at t and was not a separate independent operating entity 
we hired only a portion of the employees of the business 
under a transition services agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition  at t agreed to provide us with a variety of services to enable us to continue to operate the business pending the transition to easylink 
we have successfully transitioned virtually all of these services provided by at t under the transition services agreement to ourselves  including customer service  network operations center  telex switching equipment and services and office space in a variety of locations 
however  the network for the portion of this business relating to edi  fax and email services continues to reside on at t s premises  but is being operated and maintained by easylink 
the agreement expires on january  we plan to seek to extend this agreement prior to its expiration 
if we are unable to extend the agreement  we will need to either migrate the network off of the at t premises to easylink s premises or migrate the customers to a replacement network 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully migrate the remaining easylink services customers or network from at t s premises to our own premises  or successfully integrate them into our operations  in a timely manner or without incurring substantial unforeseen expense or without service interruption to our customers 
even if successfully migrated  we may be unable to operate the business at expense levels that are ultimately profitable for us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain all of the customers of the easylink services business 
our inability to successfully migrate  integrate or operate the network and operations  or to retain customers  of the easylink services business will result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
outsourcing of transaction delivery and transaction management services may not prove to be viable businesses 
an important part of our business strategy is to leverage our existing global customer base and global network by continuing to provide our existing transaction delivery services and by offering these customers additional transaction delivery and new transaction management services in the future 
the market for transaction management services is only beginning to develop 
our success will depend on the continued expansion of the market for outsourced transaction delivery services such as edi  production messaging services and integrated desktop messaging services and the development of viable markets for the outsourcing of additional transaction delivery services and new transaction management services 
each of these developments is somewhat speculative 
there are significant obstacles to the full development of a sizable market for the outsourcing of transaction delivery and transaction management services 
outsourcing is one of the principal methods by which we will attempt to reach the size we believe is necessary to be successful 
security and the reliability of the internet  however  are likely to be of concern to enterprises and service providers deciding whether to outsource their transaction delivery and transaction management or to continue to provide it themselves 
these concerns are likely to be particularly strong at larger businesses and service providers  which are better able to afford the costs of maintaining their own systems 
while we intend to focus exclusively on our outsourced transaction delivery and transaction management services  we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or expand our business customer base 
in addition  the sales cycle for many of these services is lengthy and could delay our ability to generate revenues in this market 
our strategy of developing and offering to existing customers additional transaction delivery and transaction management services may be unsuccessful 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to develop and offer to existing customers additional transaction delivery and transaction management services that will automate more of our customers business processes 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop these additional services in a timely manner or at all or  if developed  that our customers will purchase these services or will purchase them at prices that we wish to charge 
standards for pricing in the market for new transaction delivery and transaction management services are not yet well defined and some businesses and service providers may not be willing to pay the fees we wish to charge 
we cannot assure you that the fees we intend to charge will be sufficient to offset the related costs of providing these services 
we may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which would cause our stock price to decline 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
it is likely that our operating results in some quarters will be below market expectations 
in this event  the price of our class a common stock is likely to decline 
the following are among the factors that could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results incurrence of other cash and non cash accounting charges  including charges resulting from acquisitions or dispositions of assets  including from the disposition of our remaining non core assets  and write downs of impaired assets  increases or decreases in the number of transactions generated by our customers such as insurance claims  trade and travel confirmations  purchase orders  invoices  shipping notices  funds transfers  among others  which is affected by factors that affect specific customers  the respective industries in which our customers conduct business and the economy generally  gains from the restructuring or settlement of debt and other obligations  non cash charges associated with repriced stock options  if our stock price rises above  system outages  delays in obtaining new equipment or problems with planned upgrades  disruption or impairment of the internet  demand for outsourced transaction delivery and transaction management services  attracting and retaining customers and maintaining customer satisfaction  introduction of new or enhanced services by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing policy or that of our competitors  changes in governmental regulation of the internet and transaction delivery and transaction management services in particular  and general economic and market conditions and global political factors 
other such factors in our non core assets include incurrence of additional expenditures without receipt of offsetting revenues pending the sale of these assets 
we may incur significant stock based compensation charges related to repriced options if our stock price rises above 
in light of the decline in our stock price and in an effort to retain our employee base  on november   the company offered to certain of its employees  officers and directors  other than gerald gorman  the right to reprice certain outstanding stock options to an exercise price equal to per share  the closing price of the company s class a common stock on nasdaq on november  as adjusted for our reverse stock split effected on january  options to purchase  shares were repriced 
the repriced options vest at the same rate that they would have vested under their original terms 
in march  financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
interpretation 
among other issues  this interpretation clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
as a result  under the interpretation  stock options repriced after december  are subject to variable plan accounting treatment 
this guidance requires the company to remeasure compensation cost for outstanding repriced options each reporting period based on changes in the market value of the underlying common stock 
if our stock price rises above the exercise price of the repriced options  this accounting treatment may result in significant non cash compensation charges in future periods 
several of our competitors have substantially greater resources  longer operating histories  larger customer bases and broader product offerings 
our business is  and we believe will continue to be  intensely competitive 
see part i item business competition contained in this form k and subsequent reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
many of our competitors have greater market presence  engineering and marketing capabilities  and financial  technological and personnel resources than those available to us 
as a result  they may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily  and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition to direct competitors  many of our larger potential customers may seek to internally fulfill their messaging needs through the deployment of their own on premises messaging systems 
some of our competitors provide a variety of telecommunications services and other business services  as well as software and hardware solutions  in addition to transaction delivery or transaction management services 
the ability of these competitors to offer a broader suite of complementary services and software or hardware may give them a considerable advantage over us 
the level of competition is likely to increase as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
in the future  as we expand our service offerings  we expect to encounter increased competition in the development and delivery of these services 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors 
we have aggressively expanded our operations in anticipation of continued growth in our business and as a result of our acquisitions 
we have also developed the technology and infrastructure to offer a range of services in our target market 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer 
it is difficult to retain key personnel and attract additional qualified employees in our business and the loss of key personnel and the burden of attracting additional qualified employees may impede the operation and growth of our business and cause our revenues to decline 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  but they have no contractual obligation to remain with us 
in particular  our success depends on the continued service of gerald gorman  our chairman  thomas f 
murawski  our president and chief executive officer  george abi zeid  our president international operations  and michael a 
doyle  our vice president and chief financial officer 
the loss of the services of messrs 
gorman  murawski or abi zeid or of mr 
doyle  or several other key employees  would impede the operation and growth of our business 
to manage our existing business and handle any future growth  we will have to attract  retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees 
in particular  we will need to hire and retain qualified sales people if we are to meet our sales goals 
we will also need to hire and retain additional experienced and skilled technical personnel in order to meet the increasing technical demands of our expanding business 
competition for employees in messaging related businesses is intense 
we have in the past experienced  and expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
if we are unable to do so  our management may not be able to effectively manage our business  exploit opportunities and respond to competitive challenges 
our business is heavily dependent on technology  including technology that has not yet been proven reliable at high traffic levels and technology that we do not control 
the performance of our computer systems is critical to the quality of service we are able to provide to our customers 
if our services are unavailable or fail to perform to their satisfaction  customers may cease using our service 
in addition  our agreements with several of our customers establish minimum performance standards 
if we fail to meet these standards  our customers could terminate their relationships with us and assert claims for service fee rebates or monetary damages 
we may need to upgrade some of our computer systems to accommodate increases in traffic and to accommodate increases in the usage of our services  but we may not be able to do so while maintaining our current level of service  or at all 
we must continue to expand and adapt our computer systems as the number of customers and the amount of information they wish to transmit increases and as their requirements change  and as we further develop our services 
because we have only been providing some of our services for a limited time  and because our computer systems for these services have not been tested at greater capacities  we cannot guarantee the ability of our computer systems to connect and manage a substantially larger number of customers or meet the needs of business customers at high transmission speeds 
if we cannot provide the necessary service while maintaining expected performance  our business would suffer and our ability to generate revenues through our services would be impaired 
the expansion and adaptation of our computer systems will require substantial financial  operational and managerial resources 
we may not be able to accurately project the timing of increases in traffic or other customer requirements 
in addition  the very process of upgrading our computer systems could cause service disruptions 
for example  we may need to take various elements of the network out of service in order to install some upgrades 
our computer systems may fail and interrupt our service 
our customers have in the past experienced interruptions in our services 
we believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time 
these interruptions are due to hardware failures  failures in telecommunications and other services provided to us by third parties and other computer system failures 
these failures have resulted and may continue to result in significant disruptions to our service 
some of our operations have redundant switch over capability 
although we plan to install backup computers and implement procedures on other parts of our operations to reduce the impact of future malfunctions in these systems  the presence of single points of failure in our network increases the risk of service interruptions 
in addition  substantially all of our computer and communications systems relating to our services are currently located in glen head  new york  jersey city  new jersey  piscataway  new jersey  washington  dc  bridgeton  missouri  dayton  ohio  and london  england 
we currently do not have alternate sites from which we could conduct these operations in the event of a disaster 
our computer and communications hardware is vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
our services would be suspended for a significant period of time if any of our primary data centers was severely damaged or destroyed 
we might also lose customer transaction documents and other customer files  causing significant customer dissatisfaction and possibly giving rise to claims for monetary damages 
as a result of the recent relocation of our corporate headquarters during the first quarter of  we plan to consolidate over time an increasing portion of our computer systems and networks at the new location 
this consolidation may result in interruptions in our services to some of our customers 
our services will become less desirable or obsolete if we are unable to keep up with the rapid changes characteristic of our business 
our success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing services and to introduce new services in order to adapt to rapidly changing technologies  industry standards and customer demands 
to compete successfully  we will have to accurately anticipate changes in business demand and add new features to our services very rapidly 
we may not be able to integrate the necessary technology into our computer systems on a timely basis or without degrading the performance of our existing services 
we cannot be sure that  once integrated  new technology will function as expected 
delays in introducing effective new services could cause existing and potential customers to forego use of our services 
our business will suffer if we are unable to provide adequate security for our service  or if our service is impaired by security measures imposed by third parties 
security is a critical issue for any outsourced transaction delivery or transaction management service  and presents a number of challenges for us 
if we are unable to maintain the security of our service  our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers may suffer  and we may be exposed to liability 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers whose networks we may maintain or for whom we provide services 
if they are successful  they could obtain information that is sensitive or confidential to a customer or otherwise disrupt a customer s operations or obtain confidential information  including our customer s profiles  passwords  financial account information  credit card numbers  message content  stored email or other personal or business information 
our customers or their employees may assert claims for money damages for any breach in our security and any breach could harm our reputation 
our computers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar incursions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we expect to expend significant capital and other resources to license or create encryption and other technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
nevertheless  these measures may prove ineffective 
our failure to prevent security breaches may expose us to liability and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and develop our business market 
security measures taken by others may interfere with the efficient operation of our service  which may harm our reputation  adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers 
firewalls and similar network security software employed by third parties can interfere with the operation of our services 
our customers are subject to  and in turn require that their service providers meet  increasingly strict guidelines for network and operational security 
if we are unable to meet the security requirements of a customer  we may be unable to obtain or keep their business 
this is particularly the case for customers in the health insurance and financial services industries 
we are dependent on licensed technology and third party commercial partners 
we license a significant amount of technology from third parties  including technology related to our virus protection  spam control and content filtering services  internet fax services  billing processes and database 
we also rely on third party commercial partners to provide services for our trading community enablement services  document capture and management services and some of our other services 
we anticipate that we will need to license additional technology or to enter into additional commercial relationships to remain competitive 
we may not be able to license these technologies or to enter into arrangements with prospective commercial partners on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
third party licenses and strategic commercial relationships expose us to increased risks  including risks relating to the integration of new technology  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  a greater need to generate revenues sufficient to offset associated license or service fee costs  and the possible termination of or failure to renew an important license or other agreement by the third party licensor or commercial partner 
if the internet and other third party networks on which we depend to deliver our services become ineffective as a means of transmitting data  the benefits of our service may be severely undermined 
our business depends on the effectiveness of the internet as a means of transmitting data 
the recent growth in the use of the internet has caused frequent interruptions and delays in accessing and transmitting data over the internet 
any deterioration in the performance of the internet as a whole could undermine the benefits of our services 
therefore  our success depends on improvements being made to the entire internet infrastructure to alleviate overloading and congestion 
we also depend on telecommunications network suppliers such as at t corp  mci and xo communications for a variety of telecommunications and internet services 
the network for the easylink services business acquired from at t continues to reside on at t s premises 
see risk factors we may be unable to successfully complete the migration of the network relating to our business acquired from at t off of at t premises 
above  item business technology contained in this form k and subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission 
gerald gorman and george abi zeid collectively beneficially owned as of february  approximately of the total outstanding voting power of easylink and will be able to exert significant influence over any vote of stockholders 
gerald gorman  our chairman  beneficially owned as of february  class a and class b common stock representing approximately of the voting power of our outstanding common stock 
each share of class b common stock entitles the holder to votes on any matter submitted to the stockholders 
george abi zeid  our president international operations and director  beneficially owned as of february  class a common stock representing approximately of the voting power of our outstanding common stock 
based on their voting power as of february   mr 
gorman and mr 
abi zeid will likely be able to exert significant influence over the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  amendment of our charter and approval of significant corporate transactions 
mr 
gorman and mr 
abi zeid may be in a position to prevent a change in control of easylink even if other stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the shares not held by mr 
gorman and mr 
abi zeid were in favor of the transaction 
our charter contains provisions that could deter or make more expensive a takeover of easylink 
these provisions include the ability to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval 
our expansion into international markets is subject to significant risks and our losses may increase and our operating results may suffer if our revenues from international operations do not exceed the costs of those operations 
we intend to continue to expand into international markets and to expend significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
we may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
if our revenues from international operations do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations  our losses will increase and our operating results will suffer 
we face significant risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as uncertain demand in foreign markets for transaction delivery and transaction management services  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  differing technology standards  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  economic instability and fluctuations in currency exchange rates and imposition of currency exchange controls  potentially adverse tax consequences  regulatory limitations on the activities in which we can engage and foreign ownership limitations on our ability to hold an interest in entities through which we wish to conduct business  political instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  export restrictions  terrorism  and difficulties in enforcing contracts and potentially adverse consequences 
regulation of transaction delivery and transaction management services and internet use is evolving and may adversely impact our business 
there are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate activity on the internet 
however  laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy  pricing  and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
for example  the telecommunications act of restricts the types of information and content transmitted over the internet 
several telecommunications companies have petitioned the fcc to regulate isps and online service providers in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on these companies 
this could increase the cost of transmitting data over the internet 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
moreover  the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as property ownership  pornography  libel and personal privacy are applicable to the internet is uncertain 
we could face liability for defamation  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the content of messages transmitted over our system 
we may also face liability for unsolicited commercial and other email and fax messages sent by users of our services 
we do not and cannot screen all the content generated and received by users of our services 
some foreign governments  such as germany  have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the united states 
a majority of our services are currently classified by the fcc as information services  and therefore are exempt from public utility regulation 
to the extent that we are permitted to offer all of our services as a single bundle of interrelated products  then the whole bundle is currently exempt from regulation as a hybrid service 
if considered independent of the bundle  however  our fax to fax services  when conducted over circuit switched network lines  and our telex services  qualify as telecommunications services  and would thus be subject to federal regulation 
moreover  while the fcc has until now exercised forbearance in regulating ip communications  it has indicated that it might regulate certain ip communications as telecommunications services in the future 
there can be no assurance that the fcc will not change its regulatory classification system and thereby subject us to unexpected and burdensome additional regulation 
in addition  a variety of states regulate certain of our services when provided on an intrastate basis 
we obtained authorizations from the fcc to provide such telecommunications services in conjunction with our acquisition of these telecommunications services from netmoves  and are classified as a non dominant interexchange carrier 
while the fcc has generally chosen not to exercise its statutory power to closely regulate the charges or practices of non dominant carriers  it will act upon complaints against such carriers for failure to comply with statutory obligations or with the fcc s rules  regulations and policies to the extent that such services are  in the fcc s view  subject to regulation 
continued changes in telecommunications regulations may significantly reduce the cost of domestic and international calls 
to the extent that the cost of domestic and international calls decreases  we will face increased competition for our fax services which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results in operations 
in connection with the deployment of internet capable nodes in countries throughout the world  we are required to satisfy a variety of foreign regulatory requirements 
we intend to explore and seek to comply with these requirements on a country by country basis as the deployment of internet capable fax nodes continues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the regulatory requirements in each of the countries currently targeted for node deployment  and the failure to satisfy such requirements may prevent us from installing internet capable fax nodes in such countries 
the failure to deploy a number of such nodes could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our fax nodes and our faxlauncher service utilize encryption technology in connection with the routing of customer documents through the internet 
the export of such encryption technology is regulated by the united states government 
we have authority for the export of such encryption technology other than to countries such as cuba  iran  iraq  libya  and north korea 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that such authority will not be revoked or modified at any time for any particular jurisdiction or in general 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such export controls  either in their current form or as may be subsequently enacted  will not limit our ability to distribute our services outside of the united states or electronically 
while we take precautions against unlawful exportation of our software  the global nature of the internet makes it virtually impossible to effectively control the distribution of our services 
moreover  future federal or state legislation or regulation may further limit levels of encryption or authentication technology 
any such export restrictions  the unlawful exportation of our services  or new legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the legal structure and scope of operations of our subsidiaries in some foreign countries may be subject to restrictions which could result in severe limits to our ability to conduct business in these countries 
to the extent that we develop or offer messaging services in foreign countries  we will be subject to the laws and regulations of these countries 
the laws and regulations relating to the internet in many countries are evolving and in many cases are unclear as to their application 
for example  in india  the prc and other countries we may be subject to licensing requirements with respect to the activities in which we propose to engage and we may also be subject to foreign ownership limitations or other approval requirements that preclude our ownership interests or limit our ownership interests to up to of the entities through which we propose to conduct any regulated activities 
if these limitations apply to our activities  including our activities conducted through our subsidiaries  our opportunities to generate revenue will be reduced  our ability to compete successfully in these markets will be adversely affected  our ability to raise capital in the private and public markets may be adversely affected and the value of our investments and acquisitions in these markets may decline 
moreover  to the extent we are limited in our ability to engage in certain activities or are required to contract for these services from a licensed or authorized third party  our costs of providing our services will increase and our ability to generate profits may be adversely affected 
our intellectual property rights are critical to our success  but may be difficult to protect 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets  domain names and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  customers  strategic partners and others to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our precautions  unauthorized third parties may improperly obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
third parties may submit false registration data attempting to transfer key domain names to their control 
our failure to pay annual registration fees for domain names may result in the loss of these domains to third parties 
third parties have challenged our rights to use some of our domain names  and we expect that they will continue to do so  which may affect the value that we can derive from the planned disposition of the domain names included among our non core assets 
the status of united states patent protection for software products and services is not well defined and will evolve as additional patents are granted 
we have applied for a patent for some of our services  and we do not know if our application will be issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop similar technology 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  other parties have asserted and may in the future assert infringement claims against us 
we cannot be certain that our services do not infringe issued patents 
because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our services 
we have been and may continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  including claims related to the use of our domain names and claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
third parties have challenged our rights to register and use some of our domain names based on trademark principles and on the anticybersquatting consumer protection act 
if domain names become more valuable to businesses and other persons  we expect that third parties will continue to challenge some of our domain names and that the number of these challenges may increase 
in addition  the existing or future laws of some countries  in particular countries in europe  may limit or prohibit the use in those countries or elsewhere of some of our geographic names that contain the names of a city in those countries or the name of those countries 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
these claims and the potential for such claims may reduce the value that we can expect to receive from the disposition of our domain names 
in connection with the sale of our consumer based email and advertising network business  we transferred to the buyer the rights to direct the mx record  or the right to direct email messages addressed to domain names owned by us and used in this business 
although we do not operate the service or have any role in the delivery of messages sent by users of the service  our position as the registrant of the domain names used as addresses for email accounts maintained by such service may subject us to claims from time to time 
we could face liability for defamation  copyright  patent or trademark infringement  harassment  unsolicited commercial e mail and other claims based on the content of the messages transmitted over the service of this business 
these claims  even if without merit  can cause us to incur legal expenses and may divert management time and resources 
we may incur expenses and liabilities as a result of pending legal proceedings 
the company is involved in legal proceedings that may result in additional expenses or liability 
see legal proceedings contained in part i  item of this form k 
these proceedings include a broker s fee dispute in which the company is appealing a  judgment imposed on it  a claim by a landlord for an unspecified amount of damages arising out of the termination of a lease and tax assessments relating to our discontinued india 
com business in the amount of approximately  see part i  item  legal proceedings contained in this annual report on form k 
although the company intends to pursue its defense of these matters vigorously  no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
to the extent that the company is not successful in appealing the judgment or defending the claims  it will be required to pay the judgment in the broker s fee dispute or to pay any damages or tax assessments that may be found to apply in the lease termination dispute or the india tax proceedings 
to date  the company has funded  and by june the company will have paid  into a trust account to secure the payment of the judgment relating to the broker fee if the judgment is upheld on appeal 
although we intend to defend vigorously these matters  we cannot assure you that our ultimate liability  if any  in connection with these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
a substantial amount of our common stock may come onto the market in the future  which could depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our class a common stock to decline 
as of february   we had an aggregate of  shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding 
as of february   we had options to purchase approximately million shares of class a common stock outstanding 
as of february   we had warrants to purchase  shares of class a common stock outstanding 
as of february   we had approximately  shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible notes and an indeterminate number of additional shares of class a common stock issuable over three years in payment of interest on  in principal amount of notes 
as of february   over million shares of class a common stock and class b common stock were freely tradable  in some cases subject to the volume and manner of sale limitations contained in rule the remainder of our shares of class a common stock will become available for sale at various dates upon the expiration of one year holding periods or upon the expiration of any other applicable restrictions on resale 
we may issue large amounts of additional class a common stock  which may also be sold and which could adversely affect the price of our stock 
approximately million of our outstanding shares were issued in connection with the elimination of debt during the six months ended september  if the holders of these shares sell large numbers of shares  these holders could cause the price of our class a common stock to fall 
as of february   the holders of approximately million shares of outstanding class a common stock  the holders of million shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants and the holders of approximately  shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding senior convertible notes had the right  subject to various conditions  to require us to file registration statements covering their shares  or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or for other stockholders 
by exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares  these holders could cause the price of the class a common stock to fall 
an undetermined number of these shares have been sold publicly pursuant to rule our class a common stock may be subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
our class a common stock may face potential delisting from the nasdaq national market which could hurt the liquidity of our class a common stock 
we may be unable to comply with the standards for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
these standards require  among other things  that our class a common stock have a minimum bid price of specifically  an issuer will be considered non compliant with the minimum bid price requirement only if it fails to satisfy the applicable requirement for any consecutive trading day period 
it would then be afforded a calendar day grace period in which to regain compliance 
in addition  the listing standards require that we maintain compliance with various other standards  including market capitalization or total assets and total revenue  number of publicly held shares  which are shares held by persons who are not officers  directors or beneficial owners of of our outstanding shares  and market value of publicly held shares 
alternatively  we can comply with certain other standards  including a million minimum stockholders equity requirement 
the minimum bid price of our stock was below during various periods in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of and was below during the period from march  through january  on january   we effected a ten for one reverse stock split 
although our stock price exceeded the minimum bid price requirement for a period of time since our reverse stock split  our stock price was also below during the period from july  through july  and from july  through august  and from november  until july  although the company regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement on august  after a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel  no assurance can be given that we will maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
if we are unable to maintain compliance  we may be subject to delisting 
we had a total stockholders equity in the amount of million as of december  as a result  we are currently not in compliance with the million minimum total stockholders equity requirement 
an alternative listing standard to the minimum total stockholders equity standard requires that we maintain a minimum market value of our publicly held shares of not less than million 
as of the filing of this form k  we were in compliance with the million minimum market value of publicly held shares alternative standard 
there can be no assurance that easylink will maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or that it will maintain compliance with the other listing standards  including the million minimum market value of publicly held shares requirement 
if our common stock were to be delisted from trading on the nasdaq national market and were neither re listed thereon nor listed for trading on the nasdaq small cap market or other recognized securities exchange  trading  if any  in the class a common stock may continue to be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in the non nasdaq over the counter market 
delisting would result in limited release of the market price of the class a common stock and limited news coverage of easylink and could restrict investors interest in our class a common stock and materially adversely affect the trading market and prices for our class a common stock and our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing 
our stock price has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile 
our stock price has been volatile since our initial public offering and we expect that it will continue to be volatile 
as discussed above  our financial results are difficult to predict and could fluctuate significantly 
in addition  the market prices of securities of electronic services companies have been highly volatile 
a stock s price is often influenced by rapidly changing perceptions about the future of electronic services or the results of other internet or technology companies  rather than specific developments relating to the issuer of that particular stock 
as a result of volatility in our stock price  a securities class action may be brought against us 
class action litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources

 goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  overview we are a provider of services that facilitate the electronic exchange of information between enterprises  their trading communities and their customers 
on an average business day  we handle approximately one million transactions that are integral to the movement of money  materials  products and people in the global economy such as insurance claims  trade and travel confirmations  purchase orders  invoices  shipping notices and funds transfers  among many others 
we offer a broad range of information exchange services to businesses and service providers  including transaction delivery services such as electronic data interchange or edi  telex  desktop fax  broadcast and production messaging services  services that protect corporate e mail systems such as virus protection  spam control and content filtering services  and document capture and management services such as fax to database  fax to data and data conversion services 
until march   we also offered advertising services and consumer e mail services to web sites  isp s and direct to consumers 
in this market  we provided web based e mail services or webmail to internet service providers isps including several of the world s top isps  and we partnered with top branded web sites to provide webmail services to their users 
in addition  we served the market directly through our flagship web site www 
mail 
com 
on october   we announced our intention to sell our advertising network business and stated that we would focus exclusively on our established outsourced messaging business 
we also announced that as a result of our decision to focus on outsourced messaging business  we would streamline the organization and further integrate our technological and operational infrastructures 
on march   we completed the sale of our advertising network and consumer e mail business to netphone 
in connection with the sale  we entered into a hosting agreement under which we would host or arrange for a third party to host the consumer e mailboxes for netphone for a minimum of one year 
in november  we terminated the hosting agreement with netphone 
in march  we formed world 
com to develop the company s extensive portfolio of domain names into major web properties  such as asia 
com and india 
com  which served the business to business and business to consumer marketplace 
through its subsidiaries  world 
com generated revenues primarily from sales of information technology products  system integration and website development for other companies  advertising related sales and commissions earned from booking travel arrangements 
on november   we announced our intent to sell all assets not related to our core outsourced messaging business  including asia 
com inc  india 
com inc  and our portfolio of domain names 
on may   our majority owned subsidiary asia 
com  inc sold its business to an investor group 
in october  we sold a subsidiary of india 
com  inc and we have ceased conducting its portal business 
accordingly  the results of world 
com and its subsidiaries have been reclassified as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented 
see notes c and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
revenues for the year ended december  total revenues were million compared to million in and million in the declines in revenue in and as compared to the prior year primarily occurred in our production messaging services  which include fax  telex and email hosting as a result of lower volumes and negotiated individual customer price reductions at the time of service contract renewals and loss of certain customers 
however  the declines may continue 
these services have been impacted by continuing pricing pressures in the telecommunications market and by technological factors that replace or reduce the deployment of such services by our customers 
we intend to offset this continuing revenue erosion by offering new services including document capture and management services and integrated desktop management services 
during and  we generated substantially all of our revenues from information exchange services to enterprises 
during  we generated approximately of our revenues from information exchange services provided to enterprises and approximately of our revenue from the advertising network business and other sources 
all revenues from information exchange services for the years ended december  and were generated from companies we acquired since august approximately of our revenues came from these acquired businesses during operating results our operating results have significantly improved in even though revenues declined in comparison to and our net income was million for as compared to net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improved results are attributable to a number of key factors including the decision to stop offering advertising and consumer email services and to discontinue the operations of the world 
com businesses as described above  the acquisition of the easylink services business as part of the swift acquisition and the restructuring of our debt obligations which reduced interest expense to million in from million in and from million in and which resulted in gains of million in  million in and million in the results for and also included charges of million and million  respectively for the impairment of intangible assets and  in  amortization of goodwill amounted to million 
in light of the evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we believe the nature of our revenues in future periods will be more comparable to that of our prospects should be considered in light of risks described in the section of this report entitled risk factors that may affect future results 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities exchange commission s sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies were identified to be those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  long lived assets and intangible assets  contingencies and litigation  and restructurings 
revenue recognition the company s business messaging services include message delivery services such as electronic data interchange or edi  telex  desktop fax  broadcast and production messaging services  groupware hosting services  services that help protect corporate e mail systems such as virus protection  spam control and content filtering services  and professional messaging services and support 
the company derives revenues from monthly fees and usage based charges for our message delivery services  from monthly per user or per message fees for groupware hosting and virus protection  spam control and content filtering services  and license and consulting fees for our professional services 
revenue from e mail and groupware hosting services  virus protection  spam control and content filtering services  message delivery services and professional services is recognized as the services are performed 
facsimile license revenue is recognized over the average estimated customer life of years 
prior to the sale of the advertising network business on march  see note  advertising revenues were derived principally from the sale of banner advertisements 
revenue on banner advertisements was recognized ratably as the advertisements or respective impressions were delivered either on a cost per thousand or cost per action basis 
revenue on upfront placement fees and promotions was deferred and recognized over the term of the corresponding agreement 
the company also traded advertisements on its web properties in exchange for advertisements on the internet sites of other companies as part of the ad network business 
barter revenues and expenses were recorded at the fair market value of services provided or received  whichever was more determinable in the circumstances 
revenue from barter transactions were recognized as income when advertisements were delivered on the company s web properties 
barter expense was recognized when the company s advertisements are run on other companies web sites  which is typically in the same period when barter revenue was recognized 
barter revenues  which are a component of advertising revenue  amounted to million for the year ended december  barter expenses  which are a component of cost of revenues  were approximately the same million for the year ended december  other revenues includes revenues from the sale of domain names  which are recognized at the time when the ownership of the domain name is transferred provided that no significant company obligation remains and collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the licensing of domain names wherein the revenue is recognized ratably over the license periods 
to date  such revenues have not been material 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
impairment of long lived assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets 
we assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually unless events occur that require more frequent reviews 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess indefinite lived intangible impairment while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess long lived asset impairment 
if an assessment indicates impairment  the impaired asset is written down to its fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured with discounted estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate undiscounted and discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts 
on an on going basis  management reviews the value and period of amortization or depreciation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
during this review  we reevaluate the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets 
although the assumptions may vary from transaction to transaction  they generally include revenue growth  operating results  cash flows and other indicators of value 
management then determines whether there has been an impairment of the value of long lived assets based upon events or circumstances  which have occurred since acquisition 
the impairment policy is consistently applied in evaluating impairment for each of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries and investments 
contingencies and litigation we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
restructuring activities restructuring activities in and are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
prior to  restructuring activities are accounted for in accordance with the guidance provided in the consensus opinion of the emerging issues task force eitf in connection with eitf issue eitf 
eitf generally requires  with respect to the recognition of severance expenses  management approval of the restructuring plan  the determination of the employees to be terminated  and communication of benefit arrangement to employees 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
will supersede emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that costs associated with an exit or disposal plan be recognized when incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
in accordance with the standard  the company will apply sfas no 
to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  acquisitions  investments and divestitures continuing operations gn comtext during july  we acquired the assets of gn comtext gn for additionally  we received a million unsecured interest free loan from the former parent company of gn  gn store nord a s  which was paid in the fourth quarter of  and received approximately  for transition services revenues which were recorded as a reimbursement of costs during the third quarter of gn offers value added messaging services to over  customers ranging from small business to multi national companies around the world 
the excess of fair market value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed over the purchase price resulted in negative goodwill of  which was recognized as an extraordinary gain during the quarter ended september  in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no

com  inc of  after the closing of the sale  we issued  shares to elong 
com  inc in as full satisfaction of an indemnity obligation 
the indemnity obligation arose out of elong 
com s settlement of a claim brought by former lohoo shareholders for a contingent payment 
lohoo was previously acquired by elong 
com  inc results of operations and revenues revenues in were million as compared to million in the decrease of million was due primarily to reduced revenues in our production messaging services  which include fax  telex and email hosting  as a result of lower volumes and negotiated individual customer price reductions and loss of certain customers 
revenues consist almost entirely of revenues from providing information exchange services to businesses and are derived from electronic data interchange services or edi  production messaging services  integrated desktop messaging services  boundary and managed email services  and other services 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for decreased to million from million in as a percentage of revenues these costs decreased to in as compared to in however  the costs are net of a million of revenues reversal of previously accrued telecom costs as a result of a negotiated agreement with one of the company s providers 
without the reversal  costs as a percentage of revenue would have remained unchanged at 
cost of revenue reflects a decrease in costs as a percentage of revenue equal to due to depreciation charges and an increase in other costs as a percentage of revenues equal to due to fixed network expenses and fixed telecom expenses 
reductions in costs from continuing cost reduction programs in network operations  telecom rates  reductions in facilities  including reducing the number of circuits  and reduced variable telecom charges consistent with reduced customer volumes also reduced total costs in comparison to cost of revenues consists primarily of costs incurred in the delivery and support of our services  including depreciation of equipment used in our computer systems  the cost of telecommunications services including local access charges  leased network backbone circuit costs and long distance domestic and international termination charges  and personnel costs associated with our systems and databases 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million and million in and  respectively 
included in this category are costs related to salaries and commissions for sales  marketing  and business development personnel 
also included are costs for promotional programs  trade shows and marketing materials 
the cost decrease of million is primarily the result of lower staffing levels in we anticipate increases in sales and marketing expenses beyond general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the million decrease is the net impact of various cost component changes but the most significant reduction was million in our provision for bad debts as a result of improved collection and credit activities 
while certain cost components may vary  we anticipate general and administrative expenses in total to be comparable to levels 
product development expenses product development costs  which consist primarily of personnel and consultants time and expense to research  conceptualize  and test product launches and enhancements to our products  were million for as compared to million in the net decrease in costs mostly relates to lower consultants costs and lower salaries attributable to fewer employees 
we anticipate that spending for product development will increase over in connection with continuing development of new services 
restructuring charges during the year ended december   restructuring charges of million were recorded by the company 
the company s restructuring initiatives are related to the relocation and consolidation of its new jersey office facilities into one location which was completed in and a similar consolidation of facilities for our operations in england
