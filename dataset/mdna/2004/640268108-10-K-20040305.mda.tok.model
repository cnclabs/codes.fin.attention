item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are marked with and asterisk 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this report under the heading risk factors 
overview on january  we changed our name from inhale therapeutic systems  inc to nektar therapeutics 
we believe our new name better reflects our broadened capabilities and approach to drug delivery 
our new corporate identity represents the integration of our three proprietary technology platforms developed through our internal research and development efforts as well as our acquisitions of shearwater corporation now referred to as nektar al and bradford particle design  ltd 
now referred to as nektar uk 
we are working to become one of the world s leading drug delivery products based companies by providing a portfolio of technologies and expertise that will enable us and our pharmaceutical partners to improve drug performance throughout the drug development process 
to date the revenues we have received from the sales of our approved products and in connection with our collaborative arrangements have been insufficient to meet our operating and other expenses and we believe this will continue to be the case for several years 
to date  except for sales from six products using nektar advanced pegylation technology  we have not sold any commercial products and do not anticipate receiving significant revenue from product sales or royalties in the near future 
the development of a successful product is dependent upon several factors that are outside of our control 
these include  among other things  the need to obtain regulatory approval to market these products and our dependence upon our collaborative partners 
as a result of these or other risks  potential products for which we have invested substantial amounts in research and development may never produce revenues or income 
we have generally been compensated for research and development expenses during initial feasibility work performed under collaborative arrangements for all three of our technologies nektar advanced pegylation technology  nektar pulmonary technology  and nektar supercritical fluid technology 
in a typical advanced pegylation technology collaboration  we manufacture and supply the peg reagents and receive manufacturing revenues and possible royalties from sales of the pegylated commercial product 
prior to commercialization of pulmonary delivery and advanced pegylation products  we receive revenues from our partners for partial or full funding of research and development activities and progress payments upon achievement of certain developmental milestones 
in a typical pulmonary technology collaboration  our partner will provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient the majority of which are already approved by the us food and drug administration fda in another delivery form  fund clinical and formulation development  obtain regulatory approvals  and market the resulting commercial product 
we may manufacture and supply the drug delivery approach or drug formulation  and may receive revenues from drug manufacturing  as well as royalties from sales of most commercial products 
in addition  for products using our pulmonary technology  we may receive revenues from the supply of our device for the product along with revenues for any applicable drug processing or filling 
in addition to our partner funded programs  we are applying our technologies independently through internal early stage proprietary product development efforts 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and sell products using our drug delivery and other drug delivery systems 
there can be no assurance that we can generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
to fund the substantial expense related to our research and development activities  we have had to raise significant amounts of capital through the sale of equity and convertible debt 
our ability to meet the repayment obligations of our outstanding convertible debt  which as of december  totaled approximately million in outstanding principal  is dependent upon our ability to develop successful products without unexpected significant delay or expense 
even if we are successful in this regard  we may require additional capital to repay the debt obligations 
our revenues generated from our collaborative arrangements increased as a result of achieving milestones during the year ended december  revenues from product sales also increased  both in total amount and as a percentage of our overall revenues 
because of the magnitude of the revenues and resulting gross margins we receive  we do not expect that sales of our currently approved products will be sufficient for us to achieve profitability 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on the approval of and successful marketing of products with significant markets  and for which we realize relatively higher royalties 
to address our ongoing working capital needs  we sold million of convertible notes due june during the year ended december  we also attempted to address the timing of our repayment obligations by entering into privately negotiated transactions to exchange outstanding notes due in for notes due in while these transactions resulted in an overall reduction in our outstanding debt and an extension of the maturity of our repayment obligations  they also had a dilutive effect in that the notes issued in these transactions are convertible into approximately million more shares of our common stock in the aggregate than the notes which were exchanged 
we expect that we may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our working capital requirements and further secure our ability to repay our outstanding indebtedness 
recent developments in march  pfizer and aventis announced that the european medicines evaluation agency emea has accepted the filing of a marketing authorization application for exubera 
in february  the holder of our outstanding series b convertible preferred stock converted an aggregate  shares of such stock into an aggregate  shares of our common stock 
the conversion rate was approximately common shares for each preferred share which represents a conversion price of approximately per share 
we issued the shares of common stock under an exemption from the registration requirement of the act provided by section a of the act 
in february  we announced the existence of a collaboration with roche under which we have licensed a proprietary peg pegylation reagent used in the manufacture of roche s product cera continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator 
under the collaboration  we receive milestone and manufacturing revenues during development and will receive royalty and manufacturing revenues upon successful commercialization of the product 
in february  in a limited number of privately negotiated transactions  certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due june issued in october converted approximately million in aggregate principal amount of such notes for shares of our common stock 
the conversion price was per share  for an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock 
in connection with the conversion  we agreed to pay per  of the notes to be converted  for an aggregate payment of approximately million 
we recorded an expense of approximately million associated with this transaction 
we issued the shares of common stock under an exemption from the registration requirement of the act provided by section a of the act 
in january  in a privately negotiated transaction  certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due october completed an exchange and cancellation of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes held by such holders  for the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
we recorded an expense of approximately million associated with this transaction 
we issued the shares of common stock under an exemption from the registration requirements of the act provided by section a of the act 
in january  celltech announced the initiation of phase iii trials for cdp for crohn s disease 
cdp  which used our advanced pegylation technology  is also being tested in phase iii trials for rheumatoid arthritis 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vie 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well at the creation date of the vie 
special purpose entities spes created prior to february  may be accounted for under the original or revised interpretation s provisions no later than december  we have not entered into any arrangements with vies created after january  in october  we entered into a financing arrangement with a real estate partnership to complete construction of existing office facilities and provide financing for future capital improvements of up to million 
as a result of our continuing involvement and significant influence in the real estate partnership  and other provisions in the leasing transactions  the facility costs and capital lease obligations of the real estate partnership are recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
we have consolidated the real estate partnership since its inception including property and equipment of million and capital lease obligations of million as of december  our maximum exposure to loss with respect to the real estate partnership is equal to the outstanding capital lease obligation at december  of million 
the facility leased by our alabama subsidiary is owned by shearwater polymers  llc 
this entity is owned by nektar  al with the remaining owned by j 
milton harris who is one of our executive officers 
nektar  al and dr 
harris have jointly guaranteed the lease on the nektar  al facility 
the adoption of fin  as modified resulted in the consolidation of shearwater polymers  llc  including property and equipment of million  capital lease obligations of million and minority interest included in other long term liabilities of million 
our maximum exposure to loss with respect to shearwater polymers  llc  at december  is the outstanding capital lease obligation of million 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
eitf is applicable to agreements entered into after june  our adoption of eitf effective july  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
senior management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of each of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee 
judgments impacting fixed asset capitalization certain amounts have been expensed for plant design  engineering and validation costs based on our evaluation that it is unclear whether such costs are ultimately recoverable 
these assets may become fully recoverable only if and when exubera is approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies and commercial production commences 
the total amounts expensed amount to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the total amount capitalized amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december  the capitalized net book value of such assets totals million 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment 
we have adopted a policy for measuring goodwill on an annual basis 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare our fair value to our carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenues  which are difficult to predict 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level  which we have identified to be our only business segment 
in the future  we may determine that impairment tests should be performed at a level below the reporting unit level  depending on whether certain criteria are met 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a test for recoverability of our intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized only if the carrying amount of an individual intangible asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
to date  we have not determined that there has been any such impairment 
revenue recognition our research revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and consists of reimbursement of development costs  reimbursement of certain expenses  payment for clinical supplies  and amortization of milestones 
payments received for milestones achieved are deferred and recorded as revenue ratably over the next period of continued development 
management makes its best estimate of the period of time until the next milestone is reached 
this estimate affects the recognition of revenue for completion of the previous milestone 
the original estimate is evaluated every three months to determine if circumstances have caused the estimate to change and if so  amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively 
an acceptable alternative milestone revenue recognition policy could have been adopted whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by an immaterial amount compared to total revenue recognized 
stock based compensation we apply the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
under this opinion  no stock based employee compensation expense is charged for options that were granted at an exercise price that was equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  which also requires that the information be determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility factor weighted average expected life years years years the black scholes options valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in our opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee and director stock options 
however  we have presented the pro forma net loss and pro forma basic and diluted net loss per common share using the assumptions noted above 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation in thousands  except per share information years ended december  net loss  as reported    add stock based employee compensation included in reported net loss deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value methods for all awards    pro forma net loss net loss per share basic and diluted  as reported basic and diluted  pro forma results of operations years ended december   and the following table summarizes the dollar and percentage changes in the line items on our statements of operations for compared to and for compared to in thousands  except percentages 
increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs research revenue      product revenue      total revenue      cost of goods sold      product gross margin      research and development      general and administrative      purchased in process r d   n a n a amortization of intangibles     amortization of goodwill   n a n a gain on debt extinguishment   n a n a other income expense    interest income      interest expense      revenue revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased in compared to levels and increased in compared to levels 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to increases in product revenue as well as increased activities under our existing collaboration agreements with chiron and solvay 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to increased activities under our existing collaborative agreement with pfizer and chiron and revenues from our acquired subsidiaries in pfizer represented of our revenue for the years ended december  and  and for the year ended december  product sales accounted for of revenues for the year ended december   as compared to of revenues for the year ended december  contract research revenue for the years ended december   and included reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of deferred up front signing and progress payments received from our collaborative partners 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenue cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon future success in obtaining timely completion of feasibility studies  the continuation of existing collaborations  and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
product sales are dependent upon regulatory approval of new products for sale and adoption of current products in the market 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million or of product revenue 
cost of goods sold was million for the year ended december  or of product revenue 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million or of product revenue 
cost of goods sold is highly influenced by the mix of products sold and their relative stage of commercial readiness 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the workforce reduction completed in december we also have deferred certain research and development expenses to the increase for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributed to the increased spending on partner funded programs and the operating expenses of our nektar al subsidiary 
in addition  we made a one time payment of million to alliance for the rights beyond pulmonary applications for pulmosphere technology and other considerations for the year ended december   which was expensed as research and development 
we expect research and development spending to increase over the next few years as we continue to expand our development efforts under collaborative agreements using our expanded technology portfolio and to support our commercial manufacturing operations 
we forecast an increase in internally funded research spending in the next few years because we intend to increase the number of products we take through phase i clinical testing and  in some cases  phase ii  before offering the products to our biopharmaceutical partners for commercialization 
we could have an additional one to two products in clinical trials as part of our proprietary products program by the end of the following table summarizes our partner development programs for products approved for use or in clinical trials  including the indication for the particular drug or product  its present stage of clinical development or approval in the united states unless otherwise noted  and  with respect to our announced partner development programs  the identity of the corporate partner for such program

phase ii clinical trials to establish dosing and efficacy in patients 
phase i clinical trials typically in healthy subjects to test safety 
phase i trials for inhaled tobramycin and inhaled leuprolide were conducted by us prior to our collaborations with chiron and enzon  respectively 
chiron is currently conducting a phase i trial with inhaled tobramycin  and enzon may conduct a phase i trial in the future with inhaled leuprolide 
as of december   we currently have collaborations ongoing with more than biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  of which are announced 
our product pipeline includes products approved in the united states  additional product approved in europe  products in phase iii trials  products in phase ii trials  and products in phase i trials 
the length of time that a project is in a given phase varies substantially according to factors relating to the trial  such as the type and intended use of the end product  the trial design  the ability to enroll suitable patients 
generally  a project s advancement from one phase to the next is dependent upon factors that are mostly controlled by our partners 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs  clinical development programs and commercial readiness 
we estimate the costs associated with research and preclinical programs  clinical development programs and commercial readiness over the past three years to be the following in thousands years ended december  research and preclinical programs    clinical development programs    commercial readiness    total    general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to december  was primarily due to the workforce reduction completed in december the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to incremental support associated with our manufacturing and development efforts  including administrative staffing  business development and marketing 
in december  we recorded a charge of million related to a workforce reduction of employees  which represented about of our base employees 
the reduction affected all business functions and job classes mainly at our san carlos facility 
the million charge included million in severance compensation  million in health benefits and million in out placement services 
approximately million was non cash related to stock compensation 
approximately million of this amount is included in research and development costs and million is included in general and administrative costs 
during december  million was paid out associated with severance and other employee benefits 
at december   we had a remaining accrual of million of which million was paid out in the first quarter of the excess million was reversed during the second quarter of purchased in process research and development purchased in process research and development ipr d represents the portion of the purchase price of an acquisition related to research and development activities which i have not demonstrated their technological feasibility  and ii have no alternative future uses 
for the years ended december  and  we did not incur any ipr d charges 
for the year ended december   we incurred charges of million related to our acquisitions of bradford particle design and shearwater corporation 
in june  we completed our acquisition of shearwater in exchange for approximately million shares or options to acquire shares of our common stock and cash of million 
of the total purchase consideration of million  million was allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  to ipr d  and other intangible assets 
the residual amount of million was allocated to goodwill 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d  which was determined to have no alternative future use and was charged as an expense during the year ended december  in january  we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of bradford particle design in exchange for approximately million in newly issued shares of our common stock and approximately million in cash 
of the total purchase consideration of million  million was allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  to ipr d and to other intangible assets 
the residual amount of million was allocated to goodwill 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d  which was determined to have no alternative future use and was charged as an expense in the year end ended december  amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets expenses were million million included in operating expense and million is included in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and this expense item increased million from the year ended december  to december  due to the acquisition activity in amortization of goodwill there was no amortization of goodwill expenses for the years ended december  and as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease between the year ended december  and the year ended december  was associated with the adoption of sfas  business combinations  and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting standards on january  with respect to business combinations 
no impairment charges have been recorded for the years ended december  or in accordance with sfas and  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill  which resulted in a decrease in reported net loss by approximately million in  as compared to the accounting prior to the adoption of sfas and see note  goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements of part ii  item of this form k 
gain on debt extinguishment for the year ended december   gain on debt extinguishment totaled million 
gain on debt extinguishment included a million gain from the repurchase of million of convertible subordinated notes due october for million during the second quarter of gain on debt extinguishment also included a million gain from the exchange of million of convertible subordinated notes due october for the issuance of million of newly issued convertible subordinated notes due june  less million of debt origination costs 
other income expense other income expense  net  was million income for the year ended december   as compared to million expense and million expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our equity investment in alliance was determined to be fully impaired and a loss of million and million was recorded in the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income interest income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and the million decrease in interest income for the year ended december  as compared to december  and the million decrease in interest income for the year ended december  compared to december  was due to our lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and the million increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to december  primarily relates to the increase in principal amount of outstanding convertible subordinated notes resulting from our issuance in june and july of million due june this expense was offset by the decrease in the interest payable on notes exchanged in certain privately negotiated transactions  and a reduction in the principal amount of outstanding notes resulting from such exchanges  and the repurchase of outstanding notes 
the million increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to december  relates to the interest expense on our capital lease obligation associated with our build to suit lease for additional space leased at the end of provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  and nil for the years ended december  and the provision relates entirely to state taxes on our alabama subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our debt and equity securities  revenue from development contracts  product sales and short term research and feasibility agreements  financing of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements  and interest income earned on our investments of cash 
we do not utilize off balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing 
at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
year ended december  in millions  except current ratio cash  cash equivalents and short term investments current ratio cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above our operations used cash of million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the million cash used in operations primarily reflected the net loss of million and the non cash gain on debt extinguishment of million 
for the year ended december   the million of cash used in operations primarily reflects the net loss of million  partially offset by depreciation and other changes in our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the million of cash used in operations primarily reflects our net loss of million  partially offset by million of ipr d associated with our acquisitions  million in amortization of goodwill expenses  depreciation and changes in the balance sheet 
cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million cash used for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows for the year ended december  and were generated primarily by the sale and maturity of investment securities 
these cash proceeds were either reinvested or used in operations 
cash used for investing activities in was primarily related to our acquisition activity 
in connection with our acquisition of bradford  we paid net cash of million  which represented cash paid to bradford s shareholders of million  net of bradford s cash balance of million 
the remainder of this acquisition was non cash in nature 
in connection with our acquisition of shearwater  we paid net cash of million  which represents cash paid to shearwater s shareholders of million  net of shearwater s cash balance of million 
we purchased property and equipment of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and respectively 
the increase in purchased property and equipment in as compared to primarily reflects the cost of improvements made to our huntsville  alabama facility 
the decrease in purchased property and equipment in as compared to primarily reflects the completion of the second phase of construction of a new san carlos laboratory and office facility offset by continued investment in our commercial manufacturing facilities  including device manufacturing at third party contract manufacturers and expansion of our san carlos powder processing facility 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flow provided by financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes due the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to december  was primarily related to our strategic alliance with enzon which included a million investment in our preferred stock offset by a decrease in capital lease financing related to our san carlos lab facility that was substantially completed in we may continue to seek additional capital through sales of our debt and or equity securities and additional financing of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements 
in june  we entered into privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in october  for the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes in exchange for cash payments of approximately million 
in connection with this repurchase  we recorded a gain of approximately million for the early extinguishment of debt 
in october  in a limited number of privately negotiated transactions  certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due october exchanged and cancelled approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  for the issuance of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued convertible subordinated notes due june in connection with this exchange  we recorded a gain of approximately million for the early extinguishment of debt 
at december   million of convertible subordinated notes due october remained outstanding 
at december   million of convertible subordinated notes due june remained outstanding 
in addition  as of december   million of convertible subordinated notes due february and million of convertible subordinated notes due october remained outstanding 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years after years build to suit lease      huntsville  al tenant improvement loan  san carlos tenant improvement loan   shearwater polymers  llc capital lease  interest payable      operating leases      principal amount of convertible subordinated notes and debentures purchase obligations   other obligations  total      assumes current rate on huntsville  al tenant improvement loan remains at over the entire term of the loan

if canceled  we could be charged restocking and or cancellation fees ranging from to 
consists of contractual obligations to certain partners 
does not include million non interest bearing loan from pfizer  which is contingently payable upon commercial launch of exubera 
in august  we entered into a supply agreement with two contract manufacturers to provide for the manufacturing of our pulmonary inhaler device 
under the terms of the agreement  we may be obligated to reimburse both parties for the actual unamortized and unrecovered portion of any equipment procured or facilities established and the interest accrued for their capital overlay in the event that exubera does not gain fda approval to the extent that the contract manufacturers cannot re deploy the assets 
at the present time  it is not possible to estimate the loss that will occur as a result of these obligations should exubera not be approved 
research and development costs will be dependent upon the number of collaborative agreements we are engaged in  the number of our internally funded projects and the timing of our transition to commercial manufacturing of our san carlos  alabama and uk locations 
we forecast a increase in internally funded research spending in the next few years because we intend to increase the number of products we take through phase i clinical testing and  in some cases  phase ii  before offering the products to potential biopharmaceutical partners for commercialization 
this is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this report under the heading risk factors 
given our current cash requirements  we forecast that we will have sufficient cash to meet our net operating expense requirements for at least the next two years 
we plan to continue to invest in our growth and the need for cash will be dependent upon the timing of these investments 
our capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development arrangements  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and the rate of scaling up each manufacturing operation of our technologies  the timing and cost of our late stage clinical and early commercial production facility  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes and debentures as of december   million  million  and million will mature in   and  respectively 
we are not able to satisfy all of these obligations through cash flow generated by our operations 
to satisfy our long term needs  we intend to seek additional funding  as necessary  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
because we are an early stage biotechnology company  we do not qualify to issue investment grade debt or have access to certain credit facilities 
as a result  any financing we undertake will likely involve the issuance of equity  convertible debt instruments or high yield debt to fund our working capital 
to date we have been primarily dependent upon equity and convertible debt financings for capital and have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes and debentures that are convertible into our common stock 
our substantial debt  the market price of our securities and the general economic climate  among other factors  could have material consequences for our financial position and could affect our sources of short term and long term funding 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities
