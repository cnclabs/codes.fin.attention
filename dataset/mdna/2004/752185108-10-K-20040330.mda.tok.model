rand is incorporated under the law of new york and is regulated under the act as a business development company bdc 
in addition  a wholly owned subsidiary  rand capital sbic  lp is regulated under the laws of delaware and the small business administration sba 
the corporation anticipates that most  if not all  of its investments in the next year will be originated through the sbic subsidiary 
the corporation s primary business is investing in businesses usually through investments in the form of subordinated debt generally with detachable equity warrants  preferred common stock or membership interests 
we look for small and medium sized companies that meet certain criteria  including a highly qualified management team new or unique products or services with favorable industry and competitive advantage a potential for growth in cash flow a potential to realize appreciation in our equity position  if any 
our investments in portfolio companies typically range from  to  we invest either directly in the equity of a company through equity shares or through a debt instrument 
our debt instruments usually have a maturity of not more than five years and have detachable warrants 
interest is either current pay paid monthly or deferred 
in a typical private financing  we review  analyze  and confirm  through due diligence  the business plan and operations of the potential portfolio company 
we study the industry and competitive landscape and may conduct additional reference checks with customers and suppliers 
investment opportunities are identified for the corporation by the management team 
investment proposals may  however  come to the corporation from many other sources  and may include unsolicited proposals from the public and from referrals from banks  lawyers  accountants and other members of the financial community 
we believe that our reputation in the community and our experience provide a competitive advantage in originating new investments 
throughout our history we have established an extensive network of investment referral relationships 
following our initial investment in a portfolio company  the corporation may be requested to make follow on investments in a company 
follow on investments may be made to take advantage of warrants or other preferential rights granted to the corporation or otherwise to increase or maintain the corporation s position in a promising portfolio company 
the corporation may also be called upon to provide an additional investment to a portfolio company in order for that company to fully implement its business plans  to develop a new line of business or to recover from unexpected business problems 
follow on investments in a portfolio company are evaluated on a case by case basis 
we exit our private finance investments generally through the maturation of the debt security or when a liquidity event takes place  such as the sale  recapitalization  or initial public offering of a portfolio company 
the method and timing of the disposition of the corporation s portfolio investments can be critical to the realization of maximizing total return 
the corporation expects to dispose of its equity securities through the private sales of securities to other investors through an outright sale of the company or a merger 
the corporation anticipates its debentures will be repaid with interest and hopes to realize further appreciation from the warrants or other equity type instruments it receives in connection with the origination of the debenture 
economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating income 
the corporation anticipates generating cash for new investments and operating expenses through sba leverage draw downs and interest and principal payments from its portfolio concerns 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require us to closely monitor our accounting policies 
the corporation has identified three critical accounting policies that require significant judgment 
the following summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements is the valuation of its investments and the related unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
the corporation has adopted the sba s valuation guidelines for sbic s which describes the policies and procedures used in valuing investments 
investments are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for our investments 
the board of directors considers fair value to be the amount which the corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date 
the corporation analyzes and values each individual investment on a quarterly basis  and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  the corporation will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  our equity security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value and because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the favorable or unfavorable differences could be material 
in the valuation process  the corporation uses financial information received monthly  quarterly  and annually from its portfolio companies which includes both audited and unaudited financial statements  annual projections and budgets prepared by the portfolio company and other financial information supplied by the portfolio companies management 

this information is used to determine financial condition  performance  and valuation of the portfolio investments 
valuation should be reduced if a company s performance and potential have significantly deteriorated 
if the factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome  the valuation may be restored 
another key factor used in valuing the equity investments is recent arms length equity transactions entered into by the investment company that the corporation utilizes to form a basis for its underlying value 
many times the terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to those of the corporation and the impact on these variations as it relates to market value may be impossible to quantify 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized depreciation appreciation 
revenue recognition interest income interest income from portfolio debentures is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
interest on debt securities is not accrued if we have doubt about interest collection  and a reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is created  if appropriate 
collection may be considered doubtful if among other things  the company is delinquent in payment of interest  it is in default under the investment agreement or it appears that its future estimated cash will be insufficient to make the required interest payments 
deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets are primarily related to future tax benefits associated with the utilization of the corporations net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
the realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on the corporation generating sufficient taxable income through operations and realization of gains on its investments to utilize these nol s 
management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required based upon future estimated income and historical significant gains realized on the liquidation of its portfolio investment 
in the event that management s estimates or expectations regarding its future profitability do not come to fruition  the corporation may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
financial condition the corporation s total consolidated assets decreased by  or to  and its net assets decreased by  or to  at december   versus  and  at december   respectively 
the decrease in total assets and net assets can be attributed to operating losses  the revaluation of our investment and interest receivable in somerset gas transmission company  llc somerset and the realized and unrealized gain on investments 
the net investment loss of  was offset by a realized gain of  and the net increase in unrealized depreciation of 
the realized gain is comprised of the net gain derived from the sale of  shares of advanced digital information corporation adic stock during at an average sale price of and a cost basis of 
the corporation s financial condition is dependent on the success of its portfolio holdings 
it has invested a substantial portion of its assets in small and medium sized companies 
these businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  small companies that may lack experienced management 
the following summarizes the corporation s investment portfolio at the year ends indicated 
december  december  investments  at cost   unrealized depreciation appreciation  net   investments at fair value   the increase in investments at cost is due to the  of new investments made in by the corporation 
in addition  the corporation converted the accrued interest of synacor  inc synacor in the amount of  and the accrued interest of ultra scan corporation ultra scan in the amount of  into preferred equity shares of the individual companies 
an  ultra scan loan made in november was also converted in equity shares in the increase in unrealized depreciation of the investments is primarily attributable to the establishment of a reserve on the somerset membership interest for 
this adjustment was done in accordance with the corporation s established valuation policies 
see investment income below for further discussion 
during the first quarter of  the corporation revalued its equity holdings in ustec  from  to  in accordance with the established valuation policies and based on the fact that ustec received a new round of financing from an unrelated sbic lead investor at a lower valuation 
the corporation s total investments at fair value  whose fair value have been estimated by the board of directors  approximated of net assets at december  and of net assets at december  this increase in this percentage is due to the increase in new investments during the cash and cash equivalents approximated of net assets at december  compared to at december  the decrease in cash as it relates to net assets from december  to december  can be attributed to the  in new investments during the year 
the effect of the increase in tax net operating loss carryforwards and the change in unrealized depreciation on investments resulted in a net increase in the net deferred tax asset from  at december  to a net deferred tax asset of  at december  results of operations investment income the corporation s investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation on its equity investments while maintaining a current cash flow from its debenture instruments 
therefore  the corporation will invest in a mixture of debenture and equity instruments which will provide a current return on a portion of the portfolio 
the equity features contained in our investment portfolio are structured to realize capital appreciation over the long term and may not necessarily generate current income in the form of dividends or interest 
in addition  the corporation earns interest income from investing its idle funds in money market instruments

the somerset note matured on january   and accrued interest at a rate subsequent to that date 
the corporation has issued a demand letter to somerset regarding its repayment  however  as the note is in technical default and is more that days due to non payment  the corporation s accounting policies require a reserve to be established for the unpaid interest 
in september  the corporation established a reserve for the accrued interest of  and has ceased further accrual of interest under the note 
the corporation has had continuing communications with somerset  and has been active with its management team throughout the time of the investment  and believes that somerset will successfully obtain additional financing resulting in the repayment or conversion of the note into a more favorable debt or equity investment 
somerset has advised rand that its pipeline operations have begun to generate cash flows and that projected short supplies and higher prices for natural gas should continue to improve its financial outlook 
the dividend and other investment income was  in and  in this income increased due to an increase in llc related distributions generated by topps meat company  llc topps and g tec natural gas systems g tec 
the corporations investment agreements with certain pass through entities require the entities to distribute funds to the corporation for payment of income taxes on its allocable share of the entities profits 
these dividends will fluctuate based upon the profitability of the entities 
the remaining interest income from idle cash was  in and  in the reduction is primarily due to the redeployment of cash from idle cash money market accounts into investment instruments 
this  coupled with lower short term interest rates  accounted for the  decrease in the income from idle cash balances category 
for the years ended december  and total investment income was  and  for the years ended december  and  an increase of  or 
this income is comprised mainly of interest and dividend income from portfolio companies as well as interest income on idle cash

interest from other investments was  in and  in  an increase of  this income is derived from interest income on idle cash balances

liquidity and capital resources the corporation s principal objective is to achieve capital appreciation 
therefore  a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential for capital appreciation and certain of the corporation s portfolio investments may be structured to provide little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest payments 
the corporation does earn interest income on idle cash balances and has historically relied on and continues to rely to a large extent upon proceeds from sales of investments rather than investment income to defray a significant portion of its operating expenses 
because such sales cannot be predicted with certainty  the corporation attempts to maintain adequate working capital necessary for short term needs 
as of december   and  the corporation s total liquidity  consisting of cash and cash equivalents  was   and  respectively 
as of december  although the corporation had paid  to the sba to reserve  of its approved  leverage  it had not drawn down any of this leverage 
subsequent to year end as of march  the corporation borrowed  from the sbic in the form of year debentures 
management expects that it will be necessary to draw down leverage in the next fiscal year from the sbic in order to fund operations and new investments 
net cash used in operating activities has averaged  over the last three years and management anticipates this amount will continue at similar levels 
the cash flow may fluctuate based on possible expenses associated with compliance with potential new regulatory rules 
management believes that the cash and cash equivalents at december  coupled with the anticipated sbic leverage draw downs and interest and dividend payments on its portfolio investments will provide the corporation with the liquidity necessary to fund operations over the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes the cash to be received over the next five years from portfolio companies based on contractual obligations as of december  these payments represent scheduled principal and interest payments that are contained in the investment documents of each portfolio company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s investment activities contain elements of risk 
the portion of the corporation s investment portfolio consisting of equity and equity linked debt securities in private companies is subject to valuation risk 
because there is typically no public market for the equity and equity linked debt securities in which it invests  the valuation of the equity interests in the portfolio is stated at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors in accordance with the corporation s investment valuation policy 
the discussion of valuation policy contained in the notes to schedule of portfolio investments in the financial statements contained in item of this report is hereby incorporated herein by reference 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the corporation s portfolio may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the investments existed

at times a portion of the corporation s portfolio may include marketable securities traded in the over the counter market
