overview the company has been engaged in the construction  development  management and operation of cellular telephone systems in the southeastern united states 
effective august   the company contributed substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its operating subsidiary  price communications wireless  inc pcw  to the verizon partnership 
accordingly  the financial information for the year ended december  is not comparable to the year ended december  the company remains listed on the new york and other stock exchanges  has no operating assets and approximately billion in an illiquid preferred partnership interest in the verizon partnership  cash and marketable securities 
contribution of the company s wireless business to the verizon partnership on december   the company agreed to contribute substantially all of the assets of pcw and approximately million in cash to the verizon partnership in exchange for a preferred limited partnership interest in the verizon partnership 
the transaction was consummated on august  the verizon partnership assumed certain liabilities of pcw relating to the contributed business 
after giving effect to certain adjustments  as defined in the transaction agreement  pcw s initial capital account approximated billion 
according to the partnership agreement  the company is entitled to an allocation of any profits from the verizon partnership for a period of up to four years after august  equal to its preferred return  which currently approximates per annum 
the company will receive in cash of its preferred return  with the balance being added to its capital account under a letter agreement dated august   verizon communications provided the verizon partnership with million of debt financing which was used in connection with the covenant defeasance and redemption of pcw s senior subordinated notes and senior secured notes 
pcw guaranteed such indebtedness 
however  pcw is not obligated to make payment under the guaranty until verizon communications has exhausted all remedies against the verizon partnership 
the company believes that the probability of the guaranty being enforced is remote 
price has guaranteed pcw s obligation under the guaranty  and upon the closing of the transaction deposited million now million in cash and other property into a collateral account to secure the guaranty 
price controls the investment of the assets in the collateral account  has the right to withdraw certain sums such as dividends and interest on investments from the account  and has the right  in addition  to withdraw up to million from the account to cover its ordinary operating expenses 
price and verizon communications have further agreed that price will retain its cash existing at the closing of the asset contribution which is not reserved to satisfy known liabilities existing at such time and in any event in a minimum amount of million for the purpose of making such investments as price deems appropriate 
if a qualifying initial public offering of verizon wireless inc common stock as defined in the transaction agreement occurs before august  the company will have an option to subject to approval of price s shareholders exchange its preferred exchangeable interest for shares of verizon wireless common stock 
if this happens  the number of shares the company would receive would be calculated by dividing the existing balance in the company s capital account in the verizon partnership by the verizon wireless initial public offering price 
if the company chooses not to exercise such option including as a result of the failure of the company s shareholders to approve such exchange  it will be obligated to exchange its preferred exchangeable interest for verizon communications common stock on august  or such earlier date as may be specified by verizon communications 
in this latter case  the number of shares the company will receive will be determined by dividing the amount in the company s capital account as of the date of exchange by the greater of the trailing day average closing price of verizon communications common stock as of the exchange date or 
in the event a qualifying initial public offering of verizon wireless does not occur prior to august   or if verizon wireless does complete such an offering but an exchange into verizon wireless common stock does not occur solely as a result of a breach of agreement by verizon wireless  the preferred exchangeable interest will be manditorily exchanged for shares of verizon communications common stock on approximately august  in these circumstances  the number of shares of verizon communications common stock issuable to the company will equal the balance in the company s capital account in the verizon partnership on august  divided by the trailing day average closing price of verizon communications common stock  but such price may not be less than or more than at december  the closing market price of verizon communications common stock was 
although this is below the floor price of per share established in the agreement  the company believes this is a temporary decrease in the value of its investment in the verizon partnership 
during  the closing market price of verizon communications common stock was above numerous times and during the period january  to march  it fluctuated between and 
in addition  in certain circumstances including a change in control of the company or a transfer of the preferred exchangeable interest to a secured creditor of the company  verizon communications will have the right to cause an exchange of the preferred exchangeable interest into verizon communications common stock  whether or not an initial public offering of verizon wireless common stock has occurred 
after adjustments for working capital as defined in the asset contribution agreement  the amount of pcw s initial capital account in the verizon partnership approximated billion 
pursuant to the partnership agreement for the verizon partnership  pcw is entitled to receive taxable allocations of any profits from the verizon partnership in an amount up to its preferred return  which is currently at per annum 
any losses incurred by the verizon partnership will be allocated to cellco partnership and its affiliates up to an amount equal to their capital account before being allocated to pcw 
the initial investment in the verizon partnership  represented by the preferred exchangeable interest  was recorded on the company s balance sheet in an amount equal to the credit balance in the company s capital account on the verizon partnership s financial statements 
thereafter  the company has increased its investment by the amount of income it was entitled to based on the availability of profits and the agreed upon preferred rate of return and reduced such investment balance by any cash distributed by the verizon partnership to the company 
the board of directors and management have the right  consistent with their fiduciary duties and exercise of their business judgment  to recommend to the shareholders that the company be liquidated subject to the requisite vote of at least of the company s outstanding shares at a future meeting of shareholders  to seek other potential business opportunities  or to follow another course of action with respect to the company s future 
under new york state law  the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of pcc s outstanding shares will be required at a future shareholders meeting to approve a liquidation of the company 
in recent votes of pcc s shareholders between and of pcc s shareholders have failed to vote with any such failure to vote at such a future meeting of pcc s shareholders making it more difficult to reach the affirmative vote required to approve liquidation 
the board of directors consequently believes that it may be difficult at any future shareholders meeting to obtain the necessary votes to approve liquidation 
the company and mr 
price in his capacity as chief executive officer of the company and in his personal capacity have been shown a variety of potential acquisitions and opportunities 
these include the purchase of a mutual fund management company  banks  cellular properties  independent telephone companies  broadcasting and or publishing companies and the conversion of the company into a closed end investment company 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  as previously stated  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company s operating subsidiary were contributed to the verizon partnership on august  accordingly  the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  include seven and one half months of operating activity which therefore precludes any comparison of that year s operations with the year ended december   when the company did not own an operating business 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million of income from the verizon partnership whereas during the year ended december  that income was only million 
such amounts are not comparable since in  the company had only five and a half months of income from the partnership since the sale to verizon occurred on august  as stated above 
the company had million of selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  that expense is comprised mainly of salaries and severance million  legal expenses million and settlements of two legal matters million that the company had related to the cellular business that it sold 
net interest expense  other income  income taxes and net income 
interest expense decreased to million related to a tax audit  which was completed during the year ended december  such audit resulted in a net cash cost to the company of approximately  the company s long term debt was transferred to the verizon partnership upon the sale of the cellular business and therefore  there was no interest expense related to such debt during the company had million of other income for the year and that amount was mainly derived from gains on the sale of securities in both the collateral account and the company s unrestricted accounts 
see footnote to consolidated financial statements 
the company recognized million of income tax expense for the year ended december   based on pretax income of approximately million 
included in the company s taxable income was approximately million of dividend income that is subject to the dividends received exclusion 
there were also million in alternative minimum tax credits carried over to as a result of the tax audit mentioned above 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net income in contained a gain of million on the sale of the company s cellular business and as stated above  the operating results of the company s cellular business through august   whereas in the company had no operating business and its main source of income was the verizon partnership 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the company determined that the accounting for a non cash item related to the conversion of preferred stock by the company s chief executive officer and the related accrual of deferred tax benefits in prior years was not correct 
consequently  the company has restated its previously reported results for the years to to remove the effects of the prior accounting for these items  which in to included the amortization of deferred compensation and recording a related deferred tax benefit  and instead recorded compensation expense of  and  in and  respectively 
additionally  the company eliminated amortization of deferred compensation expense of  in and  in each of and and eliminated deferred tax benefits of in and  in each of and in the third quarter of  the company had written off the remaining balance of the deferred compensation of  and had reversed the previously recorded deferred tax benefits of  in conjunction with the sale of its cellular business 
in the audited financial statements for the year ended december   these write offs are now eliminated because the deferred compensation charges are now recognized in prior years and the deferred tax benefit should not have been recorded 
therefore  the net impact on retained earnings of these changes is zero as of december  although the expense is recognized in different years 
in addition  because the company s prior independent auditors have ceased operations  they are unable to issue reports on the company s restated financial statements for years ended prior to december  consequently the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and have been labeled as restated and unaudited 
the company has determined that a re audit of the prior years financial statements is not practicable and consequently has submitted the prior years statements as unaudited 
as previously stated  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company s operating subsidiary were contributed to the verizon partnership on august  accordingly  the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  include seven and one half months of operating activity which therefore precludes any comparison of that year s operations with the twelve months of operations included in the year ended december  during the first quarter of  the company adopted financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
management believes the company s cellular licenses qualified as indefinite life intangibles  which were not subject to amortization as of january  accordingly  the year ended december  does not include any amortization for cellular licenses  which amounted to million for the year ended december   and is included in depreciation and amortization 
in addition  had financial accounting standards no 
been adopted on january   net income would have been million and basic as well as fully diluted earnings per share would have been 
net interest expense  other income  income taxes and net income 
net interest expense decreased by million to million for the current year from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in interest expense on the company s long term debt as a result of the assumption by the verizon partnership of the company s long term debt million on august  effective august   the company contributed the assets of its operating subsidiary pcw and recorded a gain on the transaction 
pcw contributed million of cash  its cellular licenses million net of accumulated amortization and fixed assets million net of accumulated depreciation to the new partnership 
the new partnership assumed pcw s outstanding long term debt million and credited pcw s capital account for billion 
the gain on the transaction was million 
other income expense for amounted to an expense of  compared with income of million for the year ended december  or a net unfavorable change of million 
during the year ended december   the company realized a gain on the disposal of their minority interest in other cellular properties approximating million 
during  the company wrote off sundry investments approximating million 
in addition  includes  of net investment gains for securities including put and call options  some of which are from the company s own stock 
included in the  are certain losses not deductible for income tax purposes 
the year ended december  resulted in gains on security and put and call transactions approximating million some of which are from the company s own stock 
included in the million are gains some of which are not taxable for income tax purposes 
as previously stated  the contribution transaction is a non taxable exchange except that for financial statement purposes there is a provision for deferred taxes of million 
the million deferred tax liability on the company s balance sheet as of december  is a result of the estimated potential liability for the difference between the tax basis of the assets contributed by the company and the total consideration received by the company including the forgiveness of long term debt 
the deferred provision included in the total tax provision in the statement of operations for the current year is the difference between deferred taxes on the books of the company prior to the contribution and the million 
in addition  certain expenses netted against the gain on the contribution of the wireless business  are deductible for tax purposes and accordingly reduce taxable income for financial statement purposes 
the total provision was million for compared with a tax provision of million for the year ended december  net income of million for the year ended december  compared with net income of million for the year ended december   is a function of the items discussed above including the operating results of the company s wireless subsidiary for twelve months in but only seven and one half months in liquidity and capital resources as a result of the asset contribution transaction with verizon  the company has substantial assets but due to their illiquid nature  limited future sources of revenue 
from the asset contribution transaction august  to the exchange of the preferred exchangeable interest for either the common stock of verizon wireless inc or verizon communications inc  the preferred exchangeable interest  and the investments in the collateral account described under contribution of the company s wireless business to the verizon partnership above are expected to be substantially all of the company s assets 
after the asset contribution for a period of up to four years  pcw s share of partnership profits if available will be determined by multiplying a rate of return currently approximately per annum by the balance in its capital account 
of such share of profits taxable whether or not distributed  pcw is entitled to receive in cash  with the balance being added to its capital account in the verizon partnership 
during the year ended december  the company received million in distributions and expects to receive such distributions in the future 
during the period following the asset contribution  the company retained sufficient cash to meet its requirement under the collateral agreement and as of december  had unencumbered cash and securities equal to approximately million to meets its current needs 
besides the anticipated quarterly cash distributions from the verizon partnership  the company will have potential additional sources of cash from interest and dividends on investments in the collateral account and its other cash 
as part of the collateral agreement  the company is authorized to withdraw an aggregate of million from the collateral account to cover its ordinary operating expenses 
the company has provided a reserve for an additional million for its previous minority interests  which amount is currently being disputed by such parties 
of this amount  million was allocated to liquidate the minority interest payable balance with the remainder being allocated to the basis of the licenses contributed to the verizon partnership 
the company currently anticipates that its cash and income will be sufficient to meet any cash obligations in the future 
there is a remote risk  however  if significant unexpected cash needs arise such as a demand for payment under the company s guaranty to verizon communications  that its funds including distributions  interest and dividends will be insufficient to meet its obligations and if the company needs to borrow money to meet such obligations  it may be forced to do so on unfavorable terms 
significant accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of our critical significant accounting policies and estimates financial instruments 
at december  all of the company s investment securities were marketable equity securities classified as available for sale securities 
at december   substantially all of the company s investment securities were marketable equity securities classified as available for sale securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses for available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported  net of taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the company sells put and call options some of which are in the company s own stock 
these options entitle the holders to buy from or to sell publicly traded securities to the company during certain periods at certain prices 
the company is required to maintain collateral to support options issued 
therefore  such unsettled contracts have been classified as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets if unsettled at the balance sheet date  with changes in fair values recorded as part of other income expense 
as of december   such amount was immaterial 
revenue recognition 
service revenue from cellular operations for prepaid and post paid customers included local subscriber revenue and outcollect roaming revenue 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which was adopted in the fourth quarter of effective january   prepaid airtime revenue was recognized when the airtime was utilized and activation revenue was recognized over the estimated life of the subscriber s contract or the expected term of the customer s relationship  whichever was longer 
local subscriber revenue was earned by providing access to the cellular network access revenue or  as applicable  for usage of the cellular network airtime revenue 
access revenue was billed one month in advance and was recognized when earned 
postpaid airtime revenue was recognized when the service was rendered 
outcollect roaming revenue represented revenue earned for usage of its cellular network by subscribers of other cellular carriers 
outcollect roaming revenue was recognized when the services were rendered 
based on discussions with the sec  the company revised the classification of incollect roaming revenue for the year ended december  to reflect such revenue as part of revenues from cellular service  rather than as an offset to incollect roaming costs  as the company has historically done in the past 
such recommended change by the sec in classification resulted in an increase in corporate revenue from cellular service and a corresponding increase in engineering  technical and other direct costs of million for the years ended december  total income  net income and all other financial statements were not affected by this change in classification equipment sales and installation revenues were recognized upon delivery to the customer or installation of the equipment 
for financial reporting purposes  the company reported of revenues and expenses for the markets for which it provided cellular telephone service 
however  in several of its markets  the company held less than of the equity ownership prior to december  the minority stockholders and partners share of income in those markets is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as minority interest 
cost to add a subscriber 
the cost to add a subscriber  which consisted principally of the net loss on the sale of equipment  as well as commissions  was recognized at the time the subscriber started to receive cellular service 
both commissions and the loss on the sale of handsets  which represent a separate earnings process  were expensed in the same month that the subscriber commenced using the company s system 
engineering  technical and other direct 
engineering  technical and other direct expenses represented certain costs of providing cellular telephone services to customers 
these costs included incollect roaming expense 
incollect roaming expense was the result of the company s subscribers using cellular networks of other cellular carriers 
acquisitions and licenses 
the cost of acquired companies was allocated first to the identifiable assets  including licenses  based on the fair market value of such assets at the date of acquisition 
accordingly  the company did not record any goodwill 
licenses were amortized on a straight line basis over a year period 
subsequent to the acquisition of licenses and other long lived assets  the company continually evaluated whether subsequent events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of such licenses might warrant revision or that the remaining balance of the license rights may not be recoverable 
the company utilized projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the licenses and sales of comparable businesses to evaluate the recorded value of licenses 
expensing stock options 
the company has always submitted stock option plans for shareholder approval 
in addition  stock options have generally been granted in small amounts  often  shares or less  to fifty to one hundred employees with management never receiving excessive amounts 
currently  the principal stock options outstanding are  shares each to robert price and kim pressman at per share with another  shares each to robert price and kim pressman at per share 
in the opinion of robert price  these options are incapable of pricing and it would have harmed shareholders to expense them 
management believes stock options have helped employee performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company generally utilized fixed debt to fund its acquisitions 
management believes that the use of fixed rate debt minimized the company s exposure to market conditions and the ensuing increases and decreases that could arise with variable rate financing 
as of december   the company had no outstanding debt 
the only market risk that the company is exposed to relates to the company s investment securities  whose values fluctuate with the market and have been adjusted to reflect the market values as of december  in addition  the realizability of the company s investment in the verizon partnership could be affected if the price of verizon communications common stock is below for an extended period of time at the date it becomes convertible into verizon common stock 
the company believes its investment in the verizon partnership is realizable at its recorded value at december
