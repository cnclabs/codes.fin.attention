research and development we believe that one of the keys to our success is product innovation 
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development as a way to differentiate our existing products  while bringing new technologies and innovative  high value products to market 
we believe that our many intellectual properties are of substantial value in the manufacturing  marketing and application of our various products 
though we are not dependent  to a material extent  upon any one trademark  patent or license  certain of our businesses may be so dependent 
as such  we allocate a significant amount of our operating budget to research and development 
with the exception of  historically we have increased our annual spend from year to year 
in however  total spending decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily driven by the discontinuation of our gene regulation research program in late  which was donated to the university of pittsburgh in  the absence of one time costs in directly associated with previous restructuring initiatives  primarily the shutdown of our bristol technical center in september  and improved cost controls and the benefits earned from earlier restructuring efforts 
our spend was million 
in  we expect to spend approximately million 
approximately two thirds of our research and development efforts are currently focused in the electronic materials and coatings segments 
our principal research and development laboratories for our chemicals businesses are located in spring house  pennsylvania 
a list of our technical and research centers throughout the world can be found in item properties

we are a global specialty materials company that brings technology and innovation to the market that enhances the performance of end use consumer products made by our customers 
our salt business is one of the most recognizable brand names in the world 
our products are sold primarily for use in the construction and building  electronics  household products and personal care  packaging  food and retail  and automotive markets 
we operate six business segments coatings  adhesives and sealants  electronic materials  performance chemicals  salt and monomers 
a year in review our performance this year was a substantial improvement over and reflects our continued emphasis on growth through new product introduction  our strong global presence  and the efficiency improvements we have been implementing throughout the organization 
other significant items affecting the results of our operations include the impact of foreign currency translation  escalating raw material and energy prices  and restructuring and asset impairment charges 
in  we reported sales of  million  a increase over about one third of this increase is from organic growth through improved demand and higher selling prices in our coatings  electronic materials  salt and performance chemicals segments 
the remainder of the increase in sales was due to the impact of favorable foreign currency  primarily from the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar as well as the contribution of our recent acquisitions 
gross profit margin was  compared with in  due to the impact of higher raw material and energy costs 
selling  administrative and research expenses were relatively consistent with the prior year as our continuing focus on efficiency improvements largely offset the inflationary impact of employee related expenses 
we reported earnings from continuing operations in of million  or per share  as compared to earnings from continuing operations of million or per share 
significant items affecting the results of operations impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  we ceased amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
as a result of our impairment testing in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 a non cash charge of million million after tax  was reflected in the results as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
the impairment charges impacted the majority of our reportable segments as follows coatings million  electronic materials million  performance chemicals million and salt million 
the impairment charges were primarily the result of the economic downturn over the past two years affecting growth assumptions in certain key markets 
in addition  customer consolidation in some areas had led to downward pressure on pricing and volume

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements if the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment  and if different estimates and assumptions were used  the result could have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
those estimates critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are listed below 
litigation and environmental reserves we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business including personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
additionally  we are involved in environmental remediation and spend significant amounts for both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to assess these matters to determine if a liability is probable  and record such a liability when the financial exposure can be reasonably estimated 
the determination and estimation of these liabilities are critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
in reviewing such matters  we consider a broad range of information  including the claims  demands  settlement offers received from a governmental authority or private party  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute and our prior experience  to determine if a liability is probable and if the value is estimable 
if both of these conditions are met we record a liability 
if we believe that no best estimate exists  we accrue the minimum in a range of possible losses as we are required to do under gaap 
if we determine a liability to be only reasonably possible  we consider the same information to estimate the possible exposure and disclose the potential liability 
our most significant reserves have been established for remediation and restoration costs associated with environmental damage 
as of december   we recorded million for environmental remediation 
we conduct studies and site surveys to determine the extent of environmental damage and necessary remediation 
with the expertise of our environmental engineers and legal counsel we determine our best estimates for remediation and restoration costs 
these estimates are based on forecasts of future costs for remediation and change periodically as additional and better information becomes available 
changes to assumptions and considerations used to calculate remediation reserves could materially affect our results of operations 
if we determine that the scope of remediation is broader than originally planned  discover new contamination  discover previously unknown sites or become subject to related personal injury or property damage claims  our estimates and assumptions could materially change 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate reserves for both our environmental and other legal liabilities are appropriate 
these estimates are based in large part on information currently available and the current laws and regulations governing these matters 
if additional information becomes available or there are changes to the laws or regulations or actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating our reserves  the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated results of our operations and statement of position 
page 
table of contents income taxes the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
in the determination of our current year tax provision  we assume that all foreign earnings are remitted to the united states and since  upon remittance  such earnings are taxable  we provide federal income taxes on income from our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits 
since significant judgment is required to assess the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  we consider such estimates to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the current year effective and deferred tax positions are appropriate 
however  if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of position 
a change in the effective tax rate would change the current year income tax expense by million 
restructuring when appropriate  we record charges relating to efforts to strategically reposition our manufacturing footprint and support service functions 
in the past three years  we recorded million  million and million in  and  respectively  for severance and other employee benefits within the provision for restructuring and asset impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
reserves are established for such initiatives by calculating our best estimate of employee termination costs utilizing detailed restructuring plans approved by management 
reserve calculations are based upon various factors including an employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary level and health care benefit choices 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to calculate these restructuring provisions are appropriate  and although significant changes are not anticipated  actual costs could differ from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating reserves 
the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of position 
long lived assets our long lived assets include land  buildings  equipment  long term investments  goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  other than investments  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in addition  changes in the expected useful life of these long lived assets may also be an impairment indicator 
as a result  future decisions to change our manufacturing footprint or exit certain businesses could result in material impairment charges 
when such events or changes occur  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the assets 
the key variables that we must estimate include assumptions regarding sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic factors 
these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
for this reason  we consider our estimates to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated results of operations 
if such assets are considered impaired  they are written down to fair value as appropriate 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually or sooner if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test for recoverability  we typically utilize discounted estimated future cash flows to measure fair value for each reporting unit 
this calculation is highly sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit and the discount rate assumed in these calculations 
these components are discussed below estimated future cash flows the key variables that we must estimate to determine future cash flows include assumptions for sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and they include inherent uncertainties page 
table of contents since they are forecasting future events 
for example  unanticipated changes in competition  customer sourcing requirements and product maturity would all have a significant impact on these estimates 
discount rate we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determining our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing 
our wacc calculation includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company and therefore beyond our control 
the average wacc used in our annual test of goodwill recoverability was and in and  respectively 
the decrease in wacc was due largely to the decline in the yield on long term treasuries which we use to determine the risk free rate of return 
a change in the wacc will result in an approximate change in the computed fair value of our reporting units 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used in the above estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
since inception of the annual goodwill recoverability testing in  our automotive coatings  powder coatings  adhesives and sealants  printed wiring board  and process chemicals reporting units have historically had fair values only slightly in excess of the book value of their net assets 
accordingly  even a small adverse change in the estimated future cash flows for these reporting units or increases in the wacc could result in the fair value of these reporting units falling below the book value of their net assets 
this could result in material goodwill impairment charges when assets are appraised and implied goodwill values are compared to carrying values 
the fair values of our long term investments are dependant on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest  as well as volatility inherent in their external markets 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we will consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of its investment entities 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used to measure plan obligations and related assets of company sponsored defined benefit pension plans  post retirement benefits  post employment benefits eg medical  disability and other employee liabilities 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  the expected long term rate of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
we typically use actuaries to assist us in preparing these calculations and determining these assumptions 
these assumptions involve inherent uncertainties  which may not be controllable by management  and as a result  adjustments to expense may be required in future periods 
we believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate plan obligations and annual expense are appropriate 
however  if the actual outcome differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of position 
the weighted average discount rate and the estimated return on us plan assets  which constitute the majority of our plan assets  used in our determination of pension expense are as follows weighted average discount rate estimated return on plan assets the following illustrates the impact on pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease from the assumptions used at december  weighted estimated combined average return on increase decrease in millions discount rate plan assets pension expense basis point increase basis point decrease page

consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net sales and operating margins in  our consolidated net sales were  million  an increase of or million  from net sales of  million 
major components of the increase included the impact of favorable foreign currency representing  increased volume and improved selling prices  with acquisitions  net of divestitures  representing the majority of the remaining 
our coatings  performance chemicals  salt and electronic materials segments performed well in  accounting for or million of the total increase over results 
the impact of favorable foreign currencies on the results of these segments accounted for of this increase 
other factors contributing to the improvement are reported as follows coatings the september acquisition of the ferro corporation s european powder coatings business and improved selling prices  performance chemicals the december acquisition of the kureha plastics additives business and improved selling prices  salt higher ice control volume resulting from the impact of the severe winter weather in  and electronic materials higher demand for advanced technology product lines in microelectronics and advanced packaging in electronic and industrial finishes 
net sales from adhesives and sealants and monomers accounted for the remaining increase of  or million  of the total increase in consolidated net sales and are more fully described in the segment section below 
page 
table of contents gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in on higher sales 
gross profit margin decreased in to from in as the impact of significantly higher raw material and energy costs were only partially offset by selling price increases 
gains from insurance settlements were material in both and results 
we recorded income of million and million in and  respectively 
although we have recorded significant gains from insurance settlements in the past two years  we cannot expect to receive like amounts in future settlements 
in  we anticipate raw material and natural gas prices to significantly exceed levels  however  it is difficult to predict the extent and duration of higher prices 
to support our operations  we purchase over billion pounds of petrochemical based raw materials globally 
the single largest of these raw materials is propylene at approximately billion pounds annually 
we are making efforts to mitigate the impact of escalating raw material and energy costs primarily by exercising control over discretionary spending  utilizing swap  option and collar contracts and increasing selling prices 
however  we anticipate the gap between raw material and selling prices to increase at least in the short term  negatively impacting gross margin in additionally  we anticipate higher expenses for employee related benefits  such as pension expense  in selling and administrative expenses in  selling and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million from million in we are beginning to see the favorable impact from recent restructuring efforts with lower salary and administrative costs as compared to however  the addition of full year results from our acquisitions  along with the unfavorable impact of foreign currency  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar on european expenses  outweighed these cost reductions 
we believe that our cost savings initiatives will continue to reduce certain administrative costs as we improve efficiencies 
however  we anticipate higher employee related costs in as a result of an increase in pension costs due to a combination of the decline in the discount rate and amortization of prior unrecognized asset losses  normal salary increases  the increasing rate of health care costs  and increased stock based compensation expense for stock option and restricted stock grants 
research and development expense we spent million on research and development costs in  a decrease of million from spending of million 
the decrease was driven by the discontinuation of our gene regulation research program in late  which was donated to the university of pittsburgh in  the absence of one time costs in directly associated with previous restructuring initiatives  primarily the shutdown of our bristol technical center in september  and improved cost controls and the benefits earned from earlier restructuring efforts 
we have budgeted for research and development expense to increase slightly in interest expense interest expense for was million  a reduction from million in  primarily due to lower us interest rates 
higher interest expense due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency on our non us denominated debt was offset by the effect of lower us interest rates 
in december  we retired million of our debt 
we expect interest expense to decrease by approximately in as a result of this retirement 
included in the reduction is a slight increase in interest expense as capitalized interest associated with our enterprise resource planning implementation begins to be amortized when those assets are placed in service 
amortization of finite lived intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for was million  a decrease from million in the decrease is due to a lower asset base as compared to  resulting primarily from the december impairment of million and the june impairment of million of certain finite lived intangible assets associated with our printed wiring board and powder coatings businesses  respectively

the initiatives included million pertaining to a european restructuring initiative which commenced in the second quarter  million associated with the elimination of positions primarily in our north american support services  such as logistics  human resources  procurement and information technology announced in the fourth quarter  and million associated with several smaller reduction in force efforts in all of our businesses throughout the year 
in most cases  separated employees were offered early termination benefits 
the charge is based on actual amounts paid to employees as well as amounts expected to be paid upon termination 
all of these initiatives were designed to address business and infrastructure inefficiencies  reduce redundant costs and reposition our workforce to capitalize on the enhancements made possible by the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
included in the million charge  is million of expense  comprised of a million reversal of charges recorded in for current year initiatives and million of expense pertaining to prior year initiatives 
changes in estimates are recorded as actual costs are compared to original estimates and reserves are adjusted as expenses are finalized 
the changes to prior year initiatives mostly include settlement losses on pension obligations as individual pension liabilities were settled from the pension plan 
we recognize pension settlement gains or losses at the time an employee s individual liability is settled within the pension plan 
as of december   positions of the  identified have been eliminated 
all initiatives will be materially complete within months from the date of implementation 
the balance at december   recorded for these severance and employee benefits  was million and included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
asset impairments in  we recognized million  net of asset impairment charges 
of the total  million was recognized as asset impairment charges recorded to adjust the carrying value of certain assets to their fair value  which was calculated using cash flow analyses 
the largest impairment of approximately million of finite lived intangible assets related to the lamineer product line of the powder coatings business in the coatings segment 
the remaining charge consisted primarily of million of finite lived intangible assets and million of net fixed assets associated with our specialty magnesia product line in the performance chemicals segment  which was acquired from morton  and million of other building and equipment impairments 
gains on sales of previously impaired assets offset the total impairment charge by million 
in  we recognized million for restructuring and asset impairments 
this charge is comprised of million for the impairment of certain long lived assets  million for costs associated with workforce reductions initiated in and million for contract lease termination penalties 
offsetting this charge was million of income resulting from pension settlement gains associated with individuals terminated from our pension plans and changes to estimates  both of which were in connection with our repositioning 
of the total charges  the million of asset impairments was recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain identified assets to their fair values  which were calculated using cash flow analyses 
the assumptions used in the page 
table of contents calculations were consistent with our internal planning process 
the largest single asset write down was million  recorded to write down certain long lived intangible and fixed assets of the printed wiring board business in the electronic materials segment 
the remaining million of non cash charges  recorded during  related largely to the closure of two european plants and other building and equipment impairments 
in a continued effort to streamline operational efficiencies  approximately million of expense was recognized for costs associated with the closure of the european plants and a general reduction in force of over positions throughout various functions of our organization 
in most cases  separated employees were offered early termination benefits 
the charge was based on actual amounts paid to employees as well as amounts expected to be paid upon termination 
the anticipated annual costs savings from the general reduction in force efforts is approximately million  primarily in compensation expense 
in general  we continue to analyze other efficiency initiatives  including plant closures  manufacturing footprint redesign and organizational restructuring brought about by the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
if approved by management  significant future initiatives could result in material restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we believe that it is possible that additional restructuring activities will be approved during and could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we are currently not able to estimate the impact of these charges although they could be material 
other income  net in  net other income increased to million from million in this increase was primarily driven by foreign exchange gains recognized on net monetary assets which increased in value with the strengthening of the euro and yen 
effective tax rate in  we recorded a provision for income tax expense of million

earnings from continuing operations were million in  compared to a loss of million in the earnings increase is primarily due to fewer costs in directly associated with restructuring activities and costs incurred to implement prior year initiatives and the impact of favorable foreign currency 
earnings in included million  after tax for restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with our european profit improvement initiatives announced in june earnings in included million  after tax of restructuring and asset impairments and million  after tax of one time costs directly associated with implementing these initiatives 
we are concerned with the recent financial performance of the adhesives and sealants business  which is performing below its potential in the marketplace and below our expectations of to net earnings margins 
as a result  we are currently developing a comprehensive plan to improve results through a combination of lowering fixed costs  stabilizing production  and driving volume growth in the high margin product lines 
we expect this business to improve its profitability in these future improvement plans could contain aspects which could result in material restructuring and asset impairment charges 
if we are unable to achieve the expected margins for this business  it would adversely impact the discounted estimated future cash flows for this segment which are used to test the recoverability of goodwill 
this could result in material goodwill impairment charges if the fair value falls below the book value of adhesives and sealants net assets

environmental there is a risk of environmental impact in chemical manufacturing operations 
our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the possibility of significant environmental impact 
the laws and regulations under which we operate require significant expenditures for capital improvements  the operation of environmental protection equipment and remediation 
future developments and even more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
our major competitors are confronted by substantially similar environmental risks and regulations 
we are a party in various government enforcement and private actions associated with former waste disposal sites  many of which are on the us environmental protection agency s epa national priority list  and we have been named a potentially responsible party prp at approximately inactive waste sites where remediation costs have been or may be incurred under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and similar state statutes 
in some of these cases we may also be held responsible for alleged property damage 
we have provided for future costs at certain of these sites 
we are also involved in corrective actions at some of our manufacturing facilities 
we consider a broad range of information when we determine the amount necessary for remediation accruals  including available facts about the waste site  existing and proposed remediation technology and the range of costs of applying those technologies  prior experience  government proposals for this or similar sites  the liability of other parties  the ability of other prps to pay costs apportioned to them and current laws and regulations 
we assess the accruals quarterly and update as additional technical and legal information becomes available 
however  at certain sites  we are unable  due to a variety of factors  to assess and quantify the ultimate extent of our responsibility for study and remediation costs 
among the sites for which we have accrued liabilities are both non company owned superfund sites and company facilities 
our significant sites are described in more detail below 
wood ridge site in wood ridge  new jersey  morton and velsicol chemical corporation velsicol have been held jointly and severally liable for the cost of remediation of environmental problems associated with a mercury processing plant site acquired by a morton predecessor 
as of the date we acquired morton  morton disclosed and accrued for certain ongoing studies related to the site 
additional data gathering has delayed completion of these studies 
in our allocation of the purchase price of morton  we accrued for additional study costs and additional remediation costs based on the ongoing studies 
page 
table of contents our exposure at the site will depend in part on the results of attempts to obtain contributions from others believed to share responsibility 
in  velsicol stopped paying its share of expenses 
velsicol s indemnitor  fruit of the loom  inc  has been reorganized under chapter bankruptcy and was discharged of its responsibility for this site after a payment to us of approximately million 
in  the bankruptcy court approved a government settlement entered into with velsicol  fruit of the loom  and other parties  which created a fund to be used to respond to the velsicol liabilities at several sites  including wood ridge 
although morton has contractual rights against velsicol for payment of a share of remedial costs that are not affected by the government settlement  we believe velsicol s ability to pay is limited 
in addition  we paid  for the epa to develop a work plan for a separate study of contamination in berry s creek  which runs near the site  and of the surrounding wetlands 
in  the epa requested information relating to sources of contamination in berry s creek  we understand this request was sent to over ninety potentially responsible parties 
today  there is much uncertainty as to what will be required to address berry s creek  but cleanup costs could be very high and our share of these costs could be material to the results of our operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position 
moss point during  the epa notified morton of possible irregularities in water discharge monitoring reports filed by its moss point  mississippi plant in early morton investigated and identified other environmental issues at the plant 
although at the date of acquisition morton had accrued for some remediation and legal costs  we revised these accruals as part of the allocation of the purchase price of morton based on our discussions with the authorities and on the information available as of june  in  we reached agreement with the epa  the department of justice and the state of mississippi  resolving these historical environmental issues 
the agreement received court approval in early the accruals established for this matter were sufficient to cover the costs of the settlement 
as a part of this agreement  chemical facilities were subject to environmental audit by an independent consultant 
findings were provided to the government  but penalties  if any  associated with the findings have not yet been negotiated 
in december  we closed the chemicals portion of the moss point facility and are in the process of closing the remaining electronic materials portion as part of the sale of the dry film business 
in december  a complaint was filed in mississippi on behalf of over plaintiffs against morton international  rohm and haas  joseph magazzu  a former morton employee  and the mississippi department of environmental quality alleging personal injury and property damage caused by environmental contamination 
similar complaints were filed in march in mississippi on behalf of additional plaintiffs 
at this time  we see no basis for these claims and we will defend these cases vigorously 
paterson we closed the former morton plant at paterson  new jersey in december  and are currently undertaking remediation of the site under new jersey s industrial site recovery act 
investigation of contamination of shallow soils and groundwater is nearly complete  with further investigation of deeper groundwater ongoing 
remediation systems for product and shallow groundwater recovery are in operation 
removal of most of the contaminated soil is complete and further soil remediation measures are under design 
an accrual was recorded for known remediation activities in september  and revised in september  to address information obtained during the ongoing site investigation 
groundwater treatment and monitoring major remediation for certain sites  such as kramer  whitmoyer  woodlands and goose farm has been completed 
we are continuing groundwater remediation and monitoring programs 
reserves for these costs have been established 
company manufacturing facilities we also have accruals for corrective action programs under governmental environmental laws at several of our manufacturing sites 
the more significant of these accruals have been recorded at the following sites bristol  pennsylvania  houston  texas  ringwood  illinois  and mozzanica  italy 
page 
table of contents remediation reserves  reasonably possible amounts and insurance settlements our reserves for environmental remediation  as presented below  are recorded appropriately as current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
in millions balance note december  amounts charged to earnings spending december  amounts charged to earnings spending december  note includes an adjustment to decrease the liability for our whitmoyer site  based on a favorable settlement with glaxosmithkline in january our reserves represent those costs that we believe to be probable and reasonably estimable 
other costs  which have not met the definition of probable  but are reasonably estimable have been included in our disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies 
in addition to accrued environmental liabilities  we have identified reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
further  we have identified other sites  including our larger manufacturing facilities  where additional future environmental remediation may be required  but these loss contingencies cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
these matters involve significant unresolved issues  including the number of parties found liable at each site and their ability to pay  the outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  the alternative methods of remediation and the range of costs associated with those alternatives 
we believe that these matters  when ultimately resolved  which may be over an extended period of time  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows  but could have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given period 
we have actively pursued lawsuits over insurance coverage for certain environmental liabilities 
it is our practice to reflect environmental insurance recoveries in the results of operations for the quarter in which the litigation is resolved through settlement or other appropriate legal processes 
these resolutions typically resolve coverage for both past and future environmental spending 
we settled with several of our insurance carriers and recorded earnings pre tax of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although we have recorded significant gains from insurance settlements in the past two years  we cannot expect to receive like amounts in future settlements 
other environmental matters capital spending for new environmental protection equipment was million in versus million in and million in spending for and is expected to be million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in this category include projects whose primary purposes are pollution control and safety  as well as environmental aspects of projects in other categories that are intended primarily to improve operations or increase plant efficiency 
we expect future capital spending for environmental protection equipment to be consistent with prior year spending patterns 
capital spending does not include the cost of environmental remediation of waste disposal sites 
the cost of operating and maintaining environmental facilities was million  million and million in  and respectively  and was charged against current year earnings 
other litigation in february  we were served with european commission decisions requiring submission to investigations in france and the united kingdom  a search permit in japan from the japanese fair trade commission  an order for the production of records and information in canada and two grand jury records subpoenas in the united states all relating to a global antitrust investigation of the plastics additives industry 
we also received a request for information from the japanese fair trade commission 
page 
table of contents the japanese fair trade commission has initiated proceedings against named japanese plastics additives producers but did not initiate action against rohm and haas 
we do not expect further action in the japanese investigation 
we are cooperating fully with all governmental authorities 
in addition  the company has been served with seven private civil antitrust actions in us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania and one in state court in ohio 
these actions have been brought against rohm and haas and other producers of plastics additives products by purchasers of these products and seek civil damages as a result of alleged violations of the antitrust laws 
the named plaintiffs in each of these actions are seeking to sue on behalf of all similarly situated direct purchasers of plastics additives products 
federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damages plus attorneys fees 
ohio state antitrust law provides for double damage indemnity 
we do not believe these cases have merit and will defend them vigorously 
there has been increased publicity about asbestos liabilities faced by manufacturing companies 
in the past  many companies with manufacturing facilities had asbestos on their premises 
as a result of the bankruptcy of asbestos producers  plaintiffs attorneys are increasing their focus on peripheral defendants  including the company  which had asbestos on its premises 
historically  these premises cases have been dismissed or settled for minimal amounts because of the minimal likelihood of exposure at our facilities 
as the asbestos producers are bankrupted  the demands against companies with older manufacturing facilities of any type in the united states  such as the company  are increasing 
we have reserved amounts for premises asbestos cases that we currently believe are probable and estimable  we cannot reasonably estimate what our asbestos costs will be if the current situation deteriorates and there is no tort reform 
there are also pending lawsuits filed against morton related to employee exposure to asbestos at a manufacturing facility in weeks island  louisiana with additional lawsuits expected 
we expect that most of these cases will be dismissed because they are barred under worker s compensation laws  however  cases involving asbestos caused malignancies may not be barred under louisiana law 
subsequent to the morton acquisition  we commissioned medical studies to estimate possible future claims and recorded accruals based on the results 
morton has also been sued in connection with asbestos related matters in the former friction division of the former thiokol corporation  which merged with morton in settlement amounts to date have been minimal and many cases have closed with no payment 
we estimate that all costs associated with future claims  including defense costs  will be well below our insurance limits 
we are also parties to litigation arising out of the ordinary conduct of our business 
recognizing the amounts reserved for such items and the uncertainty of the ultimate outcomes  it is our opinion that the resolution of all these pending lawsuits  investigations and claims will not have a material adverse effect  individually or in the aggregate  upon our results of operations  cash flows or our consolidated financial position 
indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of several of our operating businesses  we have agreed to retain  and or indemnify the purchaser against certain liabilities of the divested business  including liabilities relating to defective products sold by the business or environmental contamination arising or taxes accrued prior to the date of the sale 
our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible  minimum claim amount or cap 
as such  it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss 
no company assets are held as collateral for these indemnifications and no specific liabilities have been established for such guarantees

table of contents new accounting pronouncements asset retirement obligations effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires us to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation during the period in which it is incurred 
the corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related long lived assets and depreciated over the asset s useful life 
changes in the liability balance due to the passage of time are measured by applying an interest method of allocation to the liability amount at the beginning of the period 
this amount is recognized as an increase to the liability balance and as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows  are recognized as an increase or decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the related asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the underlying long lived asset 
our asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the following the capping of certain brine and gas wells used by our salt segment for the production of various products  and the contractual requirement to remove or dismantle certain leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a transition charge of million million after tax  reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
at january   we recognized a liability of million representing total asset retirement obligations  which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  the carrying values of the related long lived assets were increased by million  net of accumulated depreciation 
the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
provide that the pro forma liability be presented upon adoption 
our pro forma asset retirement obligation would have been million if sfas no 
was adopted on january  the liability for certain asset retirement obligations cannot currently be measured as the retirement dates are not yet determinable 
we will recognize the liability when sufficient information exists to estimate a range of potential retirement dates 
debt extinguishment and lease accounting in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and other existing authoritative pronouncements in order to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions and also limits the classification of debt extinguishments as extraordinary items 
we adopted this statement effective january  for the years ended december  and  we recorded losses on early extinguishment of debt of million million after tax and million million after tax  respectively as an extraordinary item 
in accordance with this statement  we have now reclassified the million and million pre tax loss from extraordinary to continuing operations 
guarantor s accounting in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that the guarantor recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantees 
fin also requires additional disclosure requirements about the guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements were effective for financial statement periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures page 
table of contents in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the methods used to calculate reported results 
while sfas no 
does not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the transition guidance and annual and interim disclosure provisions of sfas no 
were effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the annual disclosure provisions as of december  effective january   we prospectively adopted the fair value method of recording stock based compensation as defined in sfas no 
as a result  in we began to expense the fair value of stock options that were awarded to employees after january  prior to  we did not recognize compensation expense for stock options 
under the prospective method  the initial year impact is roughly one third based on our vesting policy of the total estimated fair value of the grants 
the annual impact of adopting this pronouncement will increase expense in subsequent years until a full run rate of expense is achieved 
results for prior years have not been restated 
variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that a variable interest be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
on february   we adopted fin for variable interest entities created after january  and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb deferred the provisions of fin for all other variable interest entities until march  we believe that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact

cautionary statements any statements we make in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including this filing  or other communications including press releases and analyst meetings and calls that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these statements include  without limitation  those relating to anticipated product plans  litigation and environmental matters  currency effects  profitability  and other commitments or goals 
forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following page 
table of contents currencies and economic conditions approximately of our sales are derived from outside the united states  a significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies 
also  significant production facilities are located outside of the united states 
our financial results therefore can be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
we use certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects  but we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
accordingly  reported sales  net earnings  cash flows and fair values have been and in the future may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  because of the extensive nature of our foreign business activities  financial results could be adversely affected by changes in worldwide economic conditions  changes in trade policies or tariffs  changes in interest rates  and political unrest 
competition and demand our products are sold in a competitive  global economy 
competitors include many large multinational chemical firms based in europe  asia and the united states 
new competitive products or pricing policies of our competitors can materially affect demand for and pricing of our products 
in addition  financial results are subject to fluctuations in demand  the seasonal activity of certain of our businesses and weather conditions  particularly for the salt segment 
we also manufacture and sell our products to customers in industries and countries that are experiencing periods of rapid change  most notably countries in eastern europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
these factors can affect demand for our products and therefore may have a significant impact on financial results 
supply and capacity from time to time  certain raw materials we require become limited 
it is likely this will occur again in the future 
should such limitations arise  disruptions of our supply chain may lead to higher prices and or shortages 
also  we are subject to increases in raw material prices and  from time to time  experience significant capacity limitations in our manufacturing operations 
these limitations  disruptions in supply  price increases and capacity constraints could adversely affect financial results 
technology we have invested significant resources in intellectual properties such as patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
since we depend on these intellectual resources for our financial stability and future growth  we rely on the protection that these intellectual property rights provide 
the development and successful implementation of new  competing technologies in the market place could significantly impact future financial results 
joint ventures  acquisitions and alliances we have entered  and in the future may enter  into arrangements with other companies to expand product offerings and to enhance our own capabilities 
we may continue to make strategic acquisitions and divestitures 
the success of acquisitions of new technologies  companies and products  or arrangements with third parties  is not predictable and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in realizing our objectives  or that realization may not take longer than anticipated  or that there will not be unintended adverse consequences from these actions 
environmental litigation risks and uncertainties related to environmental matters are discussed previously in this section under the caption environmental 
page 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices since we denominate our business transactions in a variety of foreign currencies  finance our operations through long and short term borrowings  and purchase raw materials at market prices 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
our operating and financing plans include actions to reduce this uncertainty including  but not limited to  the use of derivative instruments 
we have established policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments of which the fair market values are not available from independent third parties 
we manage counter party risk by entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating and by limiting amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause where each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of december   the fair market value of all such contracts was million which is carried as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
all of these contracts were with investment grade financial institutions 
we enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations 
the analyses quantify the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period  most commonly within a one year period 
the range of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over the forecast period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices 
foreign exchange rate risk short term exposures to changing foreign exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
known and anticipated exposures are covered by using foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts 
most significant foreign currency exposures are related to germany  france  italy  netherlands  the united kingdom  sweden  switzerland  brazil  mexico  canada  japan  taiwan  china and australia 
we estimate that an instantaneous appreciation or depreciation in all the currencies of these countries from their levels against the dollar as of december   with all other variables held constant  would increase or decrease by million the fair value of foreign currency hedging contracts held at december  this estimate is based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
our products are manufactured and sold in a number of locations around the world 
we generate revenues and incur costs in a variety of european  asian and latin american currencies 
additionally  we finance operations outside of the united states in local currencies 
our diverse base of local currency costs  financings  and foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts will partially counterbalance the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates on revenues  earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
nevertheless  when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
our current strategic policy is to maintain from to of floating rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities including short and long term debt by million  net of derivative contracts outstanding as of december  a basis point decrease in interest rates will increase the fair value by million 
however  such changes in fair values would not have a material impact on our earnings per page 
table of contents share or cash flows as the majority of our debt obligations at december  consisted of fixed rate instruments 
a basis point movement is equivalent to approximately of the weighted average rate on our worldwide debt 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas  propylene  acetone  butanol and styrene under short and long term supply contracts 
the purchase prices are generally determined based on prevailing market conditions 
changing raw material and energy prices have historically had material impacts on our earnings and cash flows in the past  and will likely continue to have significant impacts on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
commodity derivative instruments are used to reduce portions of commodity price risks 
assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  the potential change in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts held at december  approximates million
