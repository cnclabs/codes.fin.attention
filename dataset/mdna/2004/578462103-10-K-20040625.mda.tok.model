overview as of march   mayor s operated luxury jewelry stores in south and central florida and metropolitan atlanta  georgia 
on april   mayor s opened its first free standing location in florida at pga commons in palm beach gardens to replace the store in the gardens of the palm beaches mall which was closed on january   bringing the total number of stores back to during the fiscal year ended march   the company operated between and stores located in its core market of south and central florida and metropolitan atlanta  georgia as well as stores in non core areas of arizona  california  illinois  michigan  texas and virginia 
the reduction in the number of stores was a result of the execution in fiscal of a restructuring plan restructuring plan that was adopted in fiscal  which included closing under performing stores outside of the company s core market of florida and georgia 
during fiscal  mayor s operated an average of stores both within its core marketplace and the non core areas noted above 
the retail jewelry market is particularly subject to the level of consumer discretionary income and the subsequent impact on the type and value of goods purchased 
with the consolidation of the retail industry  the company believes that competition and consolidation both within the luxury goods retail industry and with other competing general and specialty retailers and discounters will continue to increase 
the luxury watch brands business comprise a significant portion of the company s business  which management believes is a result of the company s ability to effectively market high end watches 
during fiscal  watch sales constituted approximately of the company s total net sales with rolex sales alone comprising of total net sales in fiscal if  for any reason  the company is unable to obtain or sell certain watches  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the success of the company s operations depends to a certain extent on the ability of mall anchor tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic in the vicinity of the mayor s stores 
the negative performance of a mall could have an adverse effect on mayor s operations  caused by events such as the loss of mall anchor tenants in the regional malls where the mayor s stores are located  the opening of competing regional malls or stores and other economic downturns affecting customer mall traffic 
one of the company s core strategies is to continue to increase gross profit and gross margin over the next several years 
the company s strategy for gross profit and gross margin improvement is to reduce the cost of merchandise purchased through leveraging the company s purchasing power and increasing sales of exclusive and brand merchandise  and to move the mix of sales towards higher margin jewelry items  including a renewed focus on the bridal business 
in addition  the company expects to refine the allocation and management of inventory in its stores  and as a result  other direct costs such as the cost of financing inventory and inventory markdowns are expected to decrease 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s strategy to increase gross profit and gross margin will be successful 
in addition  the company is focusing on controlling and decreasing  where appropriate  operating costs which include the sharing of services of certain officers and other members of senior management 
the relationship with birks has brought synergies to both companies in several areas  including the production of holiday catalogs  television campaigns and other marketing efforts  the attainment of favorable terms on its banking facilities  and the ability to strengthen and or consolidate supplier relationships with improved terms as a result of leveraging the credibility and stronger purchasing power of the combined companies 
the retail jewelry business is seasonal in nature with a higher proportion of sales and a significant portion of earnings generated during the third fiscal quarter holiday selling season  which encompassed the thirteen weeks ended december  for the current fiscal year and the thirteen weeks ended january  in the prior fiscal year

 net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring  asset impairments and other charges depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment writedown operating loss interest and other income interest and other financial costs loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit provision loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss number of stores at year end results of operations sales the company s net sales for fiscal were million compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
comparable store net sales for fiscal  which includes stores that were open in the same periods in both the current and prior year  increased compared to fiscal due to a increase in average transaction dollars despite the decrease in number of transactions 
the increase in net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of an effective mix of merchandising and increase of inventory unit offerings in stores  due in part to the improved financial position of the company and enhanced marketing and customer events  despite the operation of less stores compared to fiscal in addition  the improvement in the us economy is credited with increased consumer confidence and spending during the latter part of fiscal comparable store net sales for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal the decrease in net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to lack of funds to finance merchandising and effective marketing because of the company s significant reduction in available capital  the continued slowdown of the economy  the impact of decreased tourism and the fifteen store closures during fiscal thirteen stores identified as part of the restructuring plan and two other underperforming stores identified in fiscal  one of which is accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with accounting rules 
sales from these closed stores were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal in addition  sales in the first half of fiscal were negatively affected by certain suppliers withholding shipments  principally rolex  due to concerns regarding the company s liquidity 
subsequent to the equity investment on august  by birks  these suppliers resumed normal shipments and the company s relationship with these suppliers greatly improved 
cost of sales and gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin in fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for fiscal primarily resulted from the ability of mayor s to increase its offering and sales of higher margin products  including those exclusive to mayor s  and substantially reduced promotional activity as compared to fiscal as well as the negative impact on the fiscal gross margin that markdowns had in connection with the liquidation of inventory in the closing of stores 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal is primarily due to low margin sales in connection with the liquidation of merchandise in the stores that were closed during fiscal as well as extensive sales promotional activity at reduced prices to generate cash flow prior to the birks equity investment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal is primarily a result of the reduction of controllable expenses as well as costs incurred in fiscal related to the stores closed as part of the restructuring plan not incurred in fiscal  offset by an increase in variable expenses related to the increase in sales in fiscal versus fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is due to the positive impact of the increase in comparable stores sales which were able to better absorb fixed costs as compared to fiscal along with cost 
table of contents reductions 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of the closing of stores stores closed as part of the restructuring plan as well as two additional stores closed which were not identified in the restructuring plan  one of which is classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with accounting rules as well as decreased advertising and marketing expenses due to capital constraints during the year and operating in fewer geographical markets due to the closing of stores outside the core florida and georgia marketplace 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges during its fiscal year ended january  fiscal  the company embarked upon an expansion strategy that saw it open five stores in fiscal  ten stores in fiscal and seven stores in fiscal merchandising and marketing issues  the poor economic climate and a capital intensive expansion strategy that the company executed in fiscal through fiscal forced the company to retrench from that strategy as part of a restructuring plan that was adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which included  among other significant initiatives  an infusion of equity  the refinancing of the company s bank debt  the closing of thirteen unprofitable and under performing stores  as well as canceling a lease for a proposed new store  the liquidation of certain non performing assets and the reduction of various field and corporate costs 
during fiscal  the company successfully executed the restructuring plan and was able to achieve the initiatives previously mentioned primarily through an equity infusion via the birks transaction described in item  related party transactions  the refinancing of the company s bank debt  which increased borrowing availability  and the closing of the stores identified at terms more favorable than originally estimated 
other charges recorded in fiscal consist of one time charges primarily for professional fees related to the execution of the restructuring plan of approximately million  reserves related to sales tax liabilities of approximately million  severance costs related to the departure of the former chief executive officer of approximately million and charges related to the sale of certain of the company s accounts receivable of approximately million 
additionally  approximately million of reserves recorded in fiscal related to the exit of leases for closed stores were reversed to income due to the fact that the leases were terminated at costs more favorable than originally estimated 
restructuring  asset impairments and other charges for fiscal were million which primarily related to the restructuring plan 
this includes consulting fees related to a strategic cost reduction project  non recurring legal fees associated with stockholder related matters  a write down of the corporate headquarters building which the company placed on the market for sale  the write down of the fixed assets for the stores that were included in the restructuring plan  and a reserve for early termination of the leases for the stores that were included in the restructuring plan 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million for fiscal  compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal was primarily due to the lack of depreciation in fiscal versus fiscal due to the disposal of fixed assets in the stores that were closed in the previous year and the corporate headquarters  which was sold in july  slightly offset by the addition of fixed assets for the company s two new stores and other fixed asset additions in fiscal the decrease in depreciation expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the disposal of fixed assets previously located at the corporate headquarters  which were sold on july   and no depreciation and amortization for fiscal related to the assets and goodwill written off in fiscal goodwill impairment writedown the goodwill impairment income of million for fiscal relates to the reversal of excess tax reserves due to a settlement with the internal revenue service for less than the amount reserved 
the tax matters existed prior to the acquisition of mayor s jewelers  inc in and would have been reversed against goodwill  however  due to the fact that the goodwill was written off in fiscal the reversal is classified in the same line item as the impairment 
goodwill impairment writedown for fiscal was million 
management determined that the long term future cash flows did not support the carrying value and recorded an impairment charge to take the goodwill to zero 
interest and other income and interest and other financial costs interest and other income was  in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal other income for fiscal includes a payment of million received in connection with a settlement with former mayor s stockholders 
interest and other financial costs were million for fiscal  compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in interest and other financial costs for fiscal as compared to fiscal and is primarily attributable to the write off of financing costs for the former working capital facilities when the new credit facility and term loan were executed 

table of contents income taxes the benefit in income taxes for fiscal of  is primarily a result of a refund claim to recover previously paid alternative minimum tax as a result of a change in tax law offset by a provision recorded for a settlement related to one of the company s subsidiaries 
the provision of million for fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in a valuation allowance to fully reserve the company s net deferred tax assets 
loss from discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal is made up of approximately million loss from operations and a million loss related to the closing of a store that was outside of mayor s core marketplace  and as such was classified as a discontinued operation 
the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal is related to the required reclassification of the store s net loss from operations to discontinued operations due to its classification in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had a million working capital credit facility with fleet retail finance and gmac and a million junior secured term loan with back bay capital 
both of the debt facilities have a maturity date of august  and are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
availability under the working capital facility is determined based upon a percentage formula applied to certain inventory and accounts receivable as allowed by an amendment on february   and has certain restrictions regarding borrowing availability 
the interest rate under the working capital facility as of march  was prime plus 
the working capital facility currently contains certain financial covenants that limit capital expenditures 
the credit facility was amended on november  to reduce the interest rate from prime plus to prime plus 
the junior secured term loan currently bears an effective interest rate of and is subject to similar restrictions and covenants as the working capital facility as well as certain prepayment penalties 
on november   the junior secured term loan with back bay capital was amended to include the reduction of the effective interest rate from to and allowed a prepayment of principal of million 
based on this  after accounting for the foregoing borrowing restrictions  the company had approximately million of borrowing capacity under its working capital facility and term loan at march  and  after netting the outstanding borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of  the company had excess borrowing capacity of approximately million 
the company relies on its short term borrowings under the credit facility to finance its operations on a day to day basis 
substantially all of the assets of the company have been pledged under the facility and term loan

the amended credit agreement provides for  among other things  effectively increasing the term loan by million  modifying the calculation of the credit facilities borrowing formula so as to fully permit the payment of the dividend without negatively impacting the availability of borrowings under the company s credit facility or otherwise creating a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  and adjusting the borrowing base to provide for the inclusion of the company s accounts receivable  up to a maximum of million

if the relationship between birks and mayor s were to cease  it would negatively impact the company 
during fiscal  cash flows from continuing operating activities used million in cash 
cash flows for discontinued operations used million in cash 
the use of cash for operating activities was primarily the result of the net loss for the year  adjusted for non cash expense items  the increase of accounts receivable and inventories offset by the decrease in other assets and the increase in accrued expenses 
during fiscal  cash flows from continuing operating activities used million in cash which was primarily the result of the net loss for the year  the increase in inventories and other assets and the payout of restructuring costs offset by the reduction of accounts receivable and increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  primarily related to the capital expenditures for leasehold improvements for the corporate headquarters  one new store and information systems 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of the company s corporate headquarters  net of capital expenditures for the opening of two new stores 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal is primarily related to net borrowings under the credit facility of million offset by the dividend of million paid to birks 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and was primarily related to the net proceeds from the birks equity investment of million and net proceeds from the sale of a majority of the credit card portfolio of million offset by the reduction of net borrowings under the credit facility of million 
management believes that barring a significant external event that materially adversely affects mayor s current business or the current industry trends as a whole  mayor s borrowing capacity under the credit facility  projected cash flows from operations and other short term borrowings will be sufficient to support the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service for at least the next twelve months 
effects of inflation gold prices are affected by political  industrial and economic factors and by changing perceptions of the value of gold relative to currencies 
investors commonly purchase gold and other precious metals perceived to be rising in value as a hedge against a perceived increase in inflation and political or economic instability  thereby bidding up the price of such metals 
the company s sales volume and net operations are potentially affected by the fluctuations in prices of gold  diamonds and other precious or semi precious gemstones as well as watches and other accessories 
the company does not currently hedge its gold purchases or inventories 
hedging is not available with respect to possible fluctuations in the price of precious and semi precious gemstones  watches or other accessories 
the company s cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses are directly affected by inflation resulting in an increased cost of doing business 
although inflation has not had and the company does not expect it to have a material effect on operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be materially affected by inflation in the future 
interest rate risk the company s credit facility accrues interest at floating rates  currently based upon prime plus 
the company manages its borrowings under this credit facility each day in order to minimize interest expense 
the impact on the company s earnings per share of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance as of march  would increase or decrease earnings per share by approximately  or approximately 
per share 
the company extends credit to its mayor s customers under its own revolving charge plan with up to three year payment terms 
finance charges are generally currently assessed on customers balances at a rate of per month 
since the interest rate is fixed at the time of sale  market interest rate changes would not impact the company s finance charge income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results may 
table of contents differ from those estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable 
the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies as noted below 
reserve for inventory shrink and slow moving inventory 
the reserve for inventory shrink is estimated for the period from the last physical inventory date to the end of the reporting period on a store by store basis and at the company s distribution center 
such estimates are based on experience and the shrinkage results from the last physical inventory 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is the basis for providing a shrink reserve 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of mayor s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss for such long lived assets would be based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell

all written or oral forward looking statements attributable to the company are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements 
since it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors  the identified items are not a complete statement of all risks or uncertainties 

table of contents risk factors in addition to other information provided in this annual report on form k  the company is subject to the following risk factors 
the company is controlled by a single stockholder 
birks  in connection with its investment in the company  was issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  which were exchanged for series a convertible preferred stock series a preferred 
upon conversion of all of the shares of series a preferred into common stock birks would own approximately a of the company 
birks is entitled to vote all of its shares of series a preferred on an as converted basis along with the  shares of common stock it owns 
additionally  birks  as the sole owner of such series a preferred  has the right to elect a percentage of the total authorized directors of the company  rounded to the next highest whole number  corresponding to the percentage of common stock that would be held by the holders on the record date of such election on an as converted basis 
currently  birks has the right to elect seven of the nine members of the board of directors 
birks was also issued  in connection with its investment in the company  warrants to acquire additional shares of common stock  which were exercised on a cashless basis on november   resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
subsequently  on march   birks sold  of these shares in a private placement sale 
accordingly  birks can control the outcome of certain stockholder votes  including votes concerning the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership by one entity may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of the company 
the company s operations could be adversely affected if its relationship with birks was to cease 
mayor s has various relationships with birks and the two companies have the same controlling shareholder group see note j to the consolidated financial statements in item herein 
in addition to the sharing of the services of certain officers and other members of senior management pursuant to the management expense reimbursement agreement and from the ability to purchase exclusive merchandise from birks pursuant to the manufacturing and sale agreement  the relationship with birks has brought synergies to both companies in several areas  including the production of holiday catalogs  television campaigns and other marketing efforts  the attainment of favorable terms on its banking facilities  and the ability to strengthen and or consolidate supplier relationships with improved terms as a result of leveraging the credibility and stronger purchasing power of the combined companies 
if the relationship between birks and mayor s were to cease  it would negatively impact the company 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if a large number of shares of the company s common stock were to be registered and sold 
in connection with birks investment in the company  the company has granted certain registration rights to birks  which entitles birks to cause the company to effect an unlimited number of registrations under the securities act of of sales of up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock 
by exercising these registration rights birks could cause a large number of shares to be registered and become freely tradable without restrictions under the securities act except for those purchased in the offering by the company s affiliates immediately upon the effectiveness of such registration 
such sales may have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock and could impair the company s ability to raise additional capital 
the company s business could be adversely affected if its relationships with any of its primary vendors are terminated 
the company s merchandising strategy depends upon its ability to maintain good relations with a few choice vendors 
certain brand name watch manufacturers  including rolex  have distribution agreements with the company that among other matters provide for specific sales locations  yearly renewal terms  and early termination provisions at the manufacturer s discretion 
the company competes with other jewelry retailers for access to vendors that will provide it with the quality and quantity of merchandise necessary to operate its business 
in fiscal  merchandise supplied by rolex  the company s largest supplier  accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales 
the company s relationships with its primary suppliers are generally not pursuant to long term agreements  including its relationship with rolex 
although the company believes that alternative sources of supply are available  the abrupt loss of any of its vendors  especially rolex  or a decline in the quality or quantity of merchandise supplied by its vendors could cause significant disruption in its business 
if rolex terminated its distribution agreement with the company  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents fluctuations in the availability and prices of the company s merchandise may affect its results of operations 
the company offers a large selection of distinctive high quality merchandise  including diamond  gemstone and precious metal jewelry  rings  wedding bands  earrings  bracelets  necklaces  charms  and its own private label jewelry 
accordingly  significant changes in prices of diamonds  gemstones  and precious metals required by the company could adversely affect the company s earnings 
further  both the supply and price of diamonds are significantly influenced by a single entity  diamond trading corporation 
the company does not maintain long term inventories or otherwise currently hedge against fluctuations in the cost of these materials 
a significant increase in the price of these materials could adversely affect the company s sales and gross margins  should the company not be able to effectively pass the increase in costs to its customers 
a substantial portion of the merchandise the company sells is carried on a consignment basis prior to sale or is otherwise financed by vendors  thereby reducing the company s direct capital investment in inventory 
the willingness of vendors to enter into such arrangements may vary substantially from time to time based on a number of factors  including the merchandise involved  the financial resources of vendors  interest rates  availability of financing  fluctuations in gem and gold prices  inflation  the company s financial condition and number of economic or competitive conditions in the jewelry business or the economy 
any significant change in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s industry is highly competitive 
the retail jewelry business is mature and highly competitive 
the company s jewelry business competes with foreign and domestic guild and premier luxury jewelers  specialty stores  national and regional jewelry chains  department stores  and to a lesser extent  catalog showrooms  discounters  direct mail suppliers  television home shopping networks and jewelry retailers who make sales through internet sites 
the company s credit operations compete with credit card companies and other providers of consumer credit 
the company believes that competition in its markets is based primarily on trust  quality craftsmanship  product design and exclusivity  product selection  service excellence  and to a certain extent  price 
many competitors are substantially larger than the company is and have greater financial resources than the company 
the company may not be able to compete successfully with such competitors 
competition could cause the company to lose customers  increase expenditures or reduce pricing  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings and stock price 
the company s quarterly operation results will fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors  and variation in quarterly results could cause the price of the company s common stock to decline 
the company s business is highly seasonal  with a significant portion of the company s sales generated during the third fiscal quarter  which includes the holiday shopping season 
sales in the third quarter of fiscal accounted for of annual net sales for such fiscal year 
the company has historically experienced lower net sales and net losses in the other fiscal quarters  and the company expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
a significant shortfall in results for the third quarter of any fiscal year could have a material adverse effect on the company s annual results of operations 
the company s quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  net sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  timing of certain holidays  changes in merchandise  general economic conditions  industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending  and actions of competitors 
the company s business is particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions 
jewelry purchases are discretionary for consumers and may be particularly and disproportionately affected by adverse trends in the general economy 
the success of the company s operations depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions and perceptions of such conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment wages and salaries  the performance of the stock market  business conditions  interest rates  availability  and cost of credit and taxation  for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where the company operates 
in addition  the company is dependent upon tourism in the markets it operates which is concentrated in the florida and georgia markets  the continued popularity of malls as a shopping destination and the ability of malls or tenants and other attractions to generate customer traffic for the company s stores 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not be adversely affected by general economic conditions  a decrease in tourism or a decrease in mall traffic  thereby negatively impacting the company s results of operations or financial condition 
a majority of the company s customers use credit either from the company s proprietary credit cards or another consumer credit source to purchase jewelry from the company 
when there are adverse trends in the general economy or increases in interest rates  fewer people use credit 
general economic trends also affect the company s credit operations 
the downturn in 
table of contents the general economy and the economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates could affect the company s ability to collect outstanding credit accounts receivable  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition 
the company s current levels of debt could impact its operations in the future the company s debt as of march   was approximately million 
the company s debt levels fluctuate from time to time based on seasonal working capital needs 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could impair the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes 
in addition  the company s credit facility includes negative covenants and financial covenants which could restrict or limit its operations 
a substantial portion of the company s indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating rates  and changes in interest rates could adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s credit business may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations governing its business 
the operation of the company s credit business subjects it to substantial regulation relating to disclosure and other requirements upon origination  servicing  debt collection and particularly upon the amount of finance charges it can impose 
any adverse change in the regulation of consumer credit could adversely affect the company s earnings 
for example  new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees the company could charge on consumer loan accounts  or restrict the company s ability to collect on account balances  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
compliance with existing and future laws or regulations could require material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the company s business or financial results 
failure to comply with these laws or regulations  even if inadvertent  could result in negative publicity  and fines  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the trading price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
the stock market  including the american stock exchange on which the shares of the company s common stock are listed  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies

the company may not be able to retain key personnel or replace them if they leave 
our success is largely dependent on the personal efforts of thomas andruskevich  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and certain other key members of the senior management team

andruskevich and certain other key members of the senior management team  the loss of any of their services could cause the company s business to suffer

competition for qualified personnel in the retail industry is intense  and the company cannot assure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for its planned operations

the company has generally been successful in negotiating leases for new stores and lease renewals as its current leases near expiration 
however  the company s business  financial condition  and operating results could be adversely affected if the company is unable to continue to negotiate profitable lease and renewal terms 
terrorist acts upon the united states could have a material adverse effect on the company
