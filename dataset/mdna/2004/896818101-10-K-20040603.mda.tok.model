item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
industry trends the commercial aerospace industry has been facing difficult challenges in recent times 
the terrorist attacks of september   the economic downturn experienced by the united states and other world markets  the military conflicts in afghanistan and iraq  and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome have severely impacted the aerospace industry resulting in a decline in air travel  excess capacity and financially distressed commercial airlines 
in response  some airlines have reduced their fleet size by grounding or permanently retiring older and less efficient aircraft 
in addition  new commercial aircraft deliveries have been declining or flat 
these trends have been somewhat offset by increased demand for new and replacement military equipment in support of stronger national defense and a renewed emphasis on homeland security 
current data indicates that the commercial aerospace industry has reached the bottom of the economic cycle 
the primary driver for the global commercial aerospace industry is world airline traffic 
we believe that traffic will be gradually restored through rationalization of fare structures and improvement in the economy 
increases in airline traffic result in corresponding increases in capacity 
available seat miles  a measure of capacity  have increased by year to date as of the end of march and are projected to continue to increase for the remainder of regional and business jet deliveries show evidence of stabilization with new aircraft production projected to increase 
air transport shipments are projected to remain flat with modest improvement beginning in an additional indicator of improvement in the commercial aerospace industry is the sequential improvement in our year over year organic sales during our fiscal year  with a gain of occurring in the fourth quarter  the first increase in nine quarters 
military sales should continue to increase in line with the us department of defense budget 
on february   the white house released its defense budget request for its fiscal which reflected an expected growth in procurement of compounded annually over the next five years 
in contrast to the stabilization and potential recovery in the aviation markets  the outlook for the igt equipment manufacturing market continues to be severely depressed with no expectation of a near term recovery 
following the end of the artificial energy shortage in late  the lower level of perceived future energy requirements caused a significant number of order cancellations for new power generating equipment 
as a result  current market shipments remain at approximately of fiscal year levels with inventories at some equipment manufacturers exceeding two years of demand 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net sales increased primarily from the positive impact from the acquisitions of ozone industries  inc in april  aerocell structures  inc 
in july  furst aircraft and instrument in august  and the boeing company s spokane fabrication operation in january  collectively  the acquisitions and from the acquisitions of parker hannifin s united aircraft products division in may and rolls royce gear systems  inc  which was renamed triumph gear systems  inc  from rolls royce north america venture i inc in january collectively  the acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales resulting from decreases in commercial airframe build rates as a result of trends in the aerospace industry discussed above in the industry trends section 
sales were further reduced from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  due to our igt market resulting from the order cancellations referred to above in the industry trends section 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal costs of products sold increased as a percentage of sales primarily due to million of costs of products sold related to the inclusion of the acquisitions and the acquisitions and the charges recorded during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal of million associated with inventory write downs at our components group operations 
also included in the net increase in cost of goods sold is a million gain recognized during fiscal related to modifications of employee benefit plans compared to a million gain recognized during fiscal in fiscal  we reduced our share of retiree medical benefits resulting in a million gain  which was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal the fiscal gain included million due to reductions in retiree medical benefits offset by a million curtailment loss resulting from freezing a defined benefit pension plan 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the reasons discussed above 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase resulting from the inclusion of the acquisitions and the acquisitions and million of increased research and development expenditures 
in addition  a million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to decisions made regarding the recoverability of customer accounts receivable and the continuing value of certain fixed assets associated with operations of our components group  partially offset by a reduction in employment costs which resulted from a reduction in headcount 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to an increase in depreciation as a result of capital expenditures made over the last twelve months and from the assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions and the acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
the net decrease in operating income from the prior year period resulted from the decrease in gross profit  most notably from the decrease in commercial airframe build rates  a decrease in igt build rates  the operating losses from our components group discussed above and the increase in depreciation and amortization expense  offset by the operating profits from the inclusion of the acquisitions and the acquisitions 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates  partially offset by increased borrowing related to the acquisitions  the acquisitions and our capital expenditure program 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the fiscal year effective tax rate of varies from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to benefits realized from the research and development tax credit of approximately million and the extraterritorial income eti exclusion of approximately million 
the rate also reflects approximately million of favorable tax adjustments resulting from the completion of income tax audits through fiscal year  partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible accruals 
discontinued operations 
in march  we designated our metals businesses metals as discontinued operations and we attempted to sell these businesses in fiscal while we did not complete the sales in fiscal year  we are continuing to pursue the sale of these businesses or the underlying assets 
current discussions are under way with several potential buyers 
the businesses that comprise our discontinued operations manufacture  machine  process and distribute metal products to customers in the computer  container and office furniture industries  primarily within north america  in addition to providing structural steel erection services 
we have historically stated that we would retain metals due to its positive cash flows  which were used to fund the growth of our aviation businesses 
however  we have decided to focus on our core capabilities in aviation and sell metals 
the loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for fiscal compared with a loss from discontinued operations before income taxes of million for fiscal the benefit for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to a benefit of million in the prior year period 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales remained virtually unchanged from the prior year period at million for fiscal a decline in net sales due to a decrease in commercial airframe build rates was offset by revenue increases from certain military programs  most significantly the c and f e f programs  from the positive impact from the acquisition of efs aerospace  inc efs in fiscal and from the acquisitions 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal costs of products sold increased as a percentage of sales primarily due to lower operating rates in relation to fixed costs  significant increases in healthcare costs  the acquisition of efs and the acquisitions  partially mitigated by reductions in employee incentive payments and employee benefits 
partially offsetting the net increase in cost of goods sold is a million gain recognized during fiscal related to the modification of employee benefit plans as described above 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the reasons discussed above 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to increases in healthcare costs and liability insurance premiums  as well as the inclusion of efs and the acquisitions  partially offset by a reduction in employment costs which resulted from a reduction in headcount and reductions in employee incentive payments and employee benefits 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to an increase in depreciation as a result of capital expenditures made over the last twelve months and from the assets acquired in connection with the inclusion of efs and the acquisitions 
special charge 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge totaling million related to the write off of design and development costs related to a new aircraft program  which we deemed unlikely to go into production 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we became aware that the program had been cancelled 
upon learning of the cancellation of the program  we evaluated our position relative to any potential recovery of our costs and determined that there was no opportunity for recovery and  accordingly  wrote off the design and development costs that had been capitalized related to the program 
operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
the net decrease in operating income from the prior year period resulted from the decrease in gross profit  most notably from the decrease in commercial airframe build rates discussed above  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by the operating profits from the inclusion of efs and the acquisitions 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates  partially offset by increased borrowing resulting from the acquisition of efs  the acquisitions and our capital expenditure program 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal discontinued operations 
in march  we designated metals as discontinued operations and we attempted to sell these businesses in fiscal the businesses that comprise our discontinued operations manufacture  machine  process and distribute metal products to customers in the computer  container and office furniture industries  primarily within north america  in addition to providing structural steel erection services 
we have historically stated that we would retain metals due to its positive cash flows  which were used to fund the growth of our aviation businesses 
however  we have decided to focus on our core capabilities in aviation and sell metals 
the loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for fiscal compared with income from discontinued operations before income taxes of million for fiscal the benefit for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to a provision of million in the prior year period 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and raised approximately million in financing activities 
as a result of the acquisition of triumph gear systems  inc and the possible effect of potential future acquisitions on the maximum total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization covenant  in march we amended our credit facility to amend certain terms and covenants 
the credit facility bears interest at either the london interbank offering rate libor plus between and  the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus if greater or an overnight interest rate at our option 
the variation in the interest rate is based upon our ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  we are required to pay a commitment fee of between and on the unused portion of our credit facility 
as of march   million was available under our credit facility 
on march   an aggregate amount of approximately million was outstanding under the credit facility  million of which was accruing interest at libor plus applicable basis points totaling per annum  and million of which was accruing interest at the overnight interest rate of per annum 
amounts repaid under our credit facility may be reborrowed 
in conjunction with amending our credit facility in march  we similarly amended certain terms and covenants of our two classes of senior notes  for the same reasons described above 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended march   primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity at several facilities and are expected to be funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
effective april   we realigned our operating structure into two business groups  triumph aerospace systems group and triumph aftermarket services group 
the companies that formerly were included in the triumph components group have been consolidated into these two groups 
in addition  several of the companies will be combined to form a new company  triumph engineered solutions  inc  which will be part of triumph aftermarket services group 
the new organization is intended to enhance our ability to deliver better coordinated solutions for our customers needs 
the creation of triumph engineered solutions  inc will enable us to more efficiently produce the products used by our customers for their turbine component maintenance requirements 
we anticipate that up to million of costs  to be funded by borrowings under our credit facility  will be incurred in fiscal as the consolidation of our components group in phoenix is completed 
in may  we acquired certain assets of parker hannifin s united aircraft products division  located in forrest  ohio 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of rolls royce gear systems  inc  located in park city  utah  which is being operated by our subsidiary  triumph gear systems  inc from rolls royce north america venture i inc 
the total cash paid at these closings of approximately million was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
on december   we announced a program to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
from the inception of the program through march   we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total purchase price of million 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt      capital lease obligations   operating leases      operating leases discontinued operations   purchase obligations    purchase obligations discontinued operations   other long term obligations total      included in our balance sheet at march  includes interest component 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisition and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions are successfully consummated  our credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods and consist of finished goods available for sale 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with invoice terms  generally when completed products or repaired parts are shipped 
our policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at our option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
if actual future sales returns  allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience  additional amounts may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
goodwill and intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
for our impairment test  we use market multiples from an external source for an average of stock price to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for certain companies in the aerospace and defense markets in computing the fair value of each reporting unit 
in the event that market multiples for stock price to ebitda in the aerospace and defense markets decrease  or the expected ebitda for our reporting units decreases  a goodwill impairment charge may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
no impairment charges have been incurred since the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
discontinued operations we account for our metals businesses as discontinued operations because we plan to sell these businesses 
accounting treatment for discontinued operations involves segregation of the net assets and operating results of the discontinued operations for separate disclosure in the financial statements  rather than including the results within the other line items of the financial statements 
we have determined that the metals businesses meet the held for sale criteria of current accounting requirements as of march  judgments and estimates were used in reaching this conclusion 
a different interpretation of current accounting literature that concluded discontinued operation accounting did not apply would have a significant impact on our financial statements  increasing revenues  operating expenses  assets and liabilities  although shareholder s equity would remain the same 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including our revolving credit facility 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates 
fixed interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rate as of march  variable interest rates disclosed fluctuate with the libor  federal funds rates and other weekly rates and represent the weighted average rate at march  expected years of maturity next months months months months months thereafter total fixed rate cash flows in thousands     weighted average interest rate variable rate cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rate there are no other significant market risk exposures 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and management s beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management s current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses  general economic conditions affecting our business segments  dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers as well as competitive factors relating to the aviation and metals industries
