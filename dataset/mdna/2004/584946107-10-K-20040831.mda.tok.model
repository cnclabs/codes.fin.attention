item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
certain statements in this annual report on form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as the same may be amended from time to time and in releases made by the sec from time to time 
such forward looking statements are not based on historical facts and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the following discussion sets forth certain factors the company believes could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any obligation to update its forward looking statements 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software costs and goodwill 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from licensing its proprietary applications software and sub licensed software  sale of computer hardware and the services performed related to the installation  training  consultation and ongoing support of the software 
license fee revenues are generally recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue from the sale of hardware is generally recognized upon shipment 
fees for installation  training and consultation are recognized as the services are provided 
if the company enters into arrangements with a client requiring significant customization of the software or services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the company recognizes revenue derived from the sale of licensed software  sub licensed software and services over the period the services are performed  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of po sition  software revenue recognition 
support and maintenance fees  typically sold on an annual renewal basis  are recognized ratably over the period of the support contract 
capitalized software costs capitalized computer software costs consist of expenses incurred in creating and developing computer software products 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  once technological feasibility has been established  the costs associated with software development are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
capitalized costs are amortized based on estimated current and future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of five to seven years of the software 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible assets of businesses acquired 
these business acquisitions include digimedics in  pharmakon which was merged into digimedics and jac in june and informedics in september costs allocated to goodwill in the informedics acquisition totaled  and was being amortized over twelve years using the straight line method 
all other goodwill was being amortized using the straight line method over twenty years 
amortization expense was in  and  respectively 
accumulated amortization for goodwill was  at june  and goodwill is reduced by the recognition of the related income tax benefit 
prior to july   the company periodically assessed whether goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and other long lived assets to be disposed of 
commencing july   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and evaluates for impairment utilizing undiscounted projected cashflows 
as of june   management believes that no such impairment has occurred

the jac division recorded a decrease of  or  to  in fiscal the decrease reflects less migration activity during fiscal as the division approaches completion of its installed customer base migration 
system sales in the pharmacy division decreased  or  to  from  the decrease in pharmacy division system sales is primarily due to two significant integrated delivery network contracts signed during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the pharmacy division continued to market and sell its worx product 
additionally  the division successfully released and subsequently signed its initial contracts for both its medicoe and medimar products 
medicoe allows clinicians to enter medication orders and manage drug therapy directly into the worx product using internet technology while medimar helps close the patient safety loop related to the delivery of drugs within the hospital 
system sales for the blood bank division were  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal the increase reflects the early adoption of the new transfusion blood bank software solution  hcll  which received fda clearance in the last quarter of fiscal this early adoption phase represents new customers along with the initial migration of several customers from the heritage systems 
management believes  but cannot give any assurance  that system sales of perioperative solutions  medicoe  medimar and hcll will continue to increase as a result of continued marketing efforts and market a cceptance of these products by the company service revenues  which include recurring software support  implementation and training services increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal all divisions contributed to the company s increased service revenue levels as implementation and installation services of related system sales were performed during fiscal additionally  the increase is related to annual escalation rates in current customer support contracts and the addition of new customers into the company s installed base

these costs can vary as the mix of revenues varies between high margin proprietary software and lower margin computer hardware and sublicensed software components 
cost of systems decreased  or  during fiscal due to the overall increase in proprietary software sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal an increase in proprietary software sales also resulted in an improved gross margin percentage 
the gross margin percentage  excluding amortization of capitalized software costs  on system sales improved to in fiscal from in costs of services include the salaries of client service personnel and communications expenses along with direct expenses of the client service departments 
cost of services increased  or  in over the previous year 
despite the increase in cost of services  gross margin on service revenues remained relatively consistent at in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in service costs is primarily a result of the company s efforts to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction using currently installed products 
additionally  the company has increased service staff levels in anticipation of the operational impact related to increased hcll  medimar  and medicoe system sales in the blood bank and pharmacy divisions 
management believes  but cannot assure  that cost of services as a percentage of service revenue will remain consistent with its current utilization rates which are defined as the percentage of billed hours to worked hours of i ts service personnel 
amortization of capitalized software increased  or  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software costs related to the hcll product  which reached commercialization in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as amortization of capitalized software costs related to the medicoe and medimar products released by the pharmacy division during fiscal year software development costs include salaries  consulting  documentation  office and other direct expenses incurred in product development activities 
software development costs increased  in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal expenditures for software development include amounts paid for both capitalizable and noncapitalizable development projects 
total expenditures for software development were  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase primarily reflects increases of  and  in expenditures in the pharmacy division and the jac division  respectively  partially offset by decreases of  and  in the blood bank division and operating room division  respectively 
the increased software development expenditures in the pharmacy division reflect continued investment in the medicoe and medimar development projects 
management expects continued product development investme nt in all of its divisions

system sales in the pharmacy division increased  or  to  from  as a result of continued market acceptance of the worx product and sales to integrated delivery networks idn during fiscal the jac division recorded an increase of  or  to  in fiscal  which is primarily attributable to upgrade sales to its installed base accounts 
the company s operating room division experienced an increase in system sales of  or  from  to  this increase is mostly due to current clients electing to convert to the new perioperative solutions software product as well as the additional offering of a bar code solution 
system sales for the blood bank division were  a decrease of  or  from  in fiscal as the division completed the development of its new transfusion software solution  hcll 
during the last half of the fiscal year  the blood bank division conducted a field correction as a result of an inspection by the fda  which found customers using a non compliant hemocare product 
historically  the blood bank division had delivered to its customers updated software containing improvements and bug fixes as required under fda regulations  however the customers had not implemented the updated software 
the blood bank division provided software and services to assist customers in completing their required fda validation processes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the blood bank division began the early stages of its marketing and sales efforts for the new hcll product as well as a derivative of the hcll product specially designed to help track stem cell samples 
these combined events resulted i n additional revenues for the blood bank division during the last half of fiscal management believes  but cannot assure  that system sales for the blood bank division will increase as a result of its continued marketing efforts for the new hcll product 
service revenues  which include recurring software support  implementation and training services increased or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal all divisions contributed to the company s increased service revenue levels as implementation and installation services of related system sales were performed during fiscal additionally  the increase is related to annual escalation rates in current customer support contracts and the addition of new customers into the company s installed base

these costs can vary as the mix of revenues varies between high margin proprietary software and lower margin computer hardware and sublicensed software components 
cost of systems decreased  or  during fiscal due to the overall increase in proprietary software sales compared to hardware sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal an increase in proprietary software sales also resulted in an improved gross margin percentage 
the gross margin percentage  excluding amortization of capitalized software costs  on system sales improved to in fiscal from in costs of services include the salaries of client service personnel and communications expenses along with direct expenses of the client service departments 
cost of services increased  or  in over the previous year 
despite the increase in cost of services  gross margin on service revenues remained relatively consistent at in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in service costs is primarily a result of the company s efforts to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction using currently installed products along with preparation for the operational impact from the marketing of its new products in the pharmacy and blood bank divisions 
management believes  but cannot assure  that cost of services as a percentage of service revenue will remain consistent with its current utilization rates which are defined as the percentage of billed hours to worked hours of its service personnel 
amortization of capitalized software increased  or  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased amortization of capitalized software costs related to the new transfusion product  which reached commercialization in the fourth quarter of fiscal software development costs include salaries  consulting  documentation  office and other related expenses incurred in product development activities

as reported in fiscal  the company noted technical deficiencies in its k employee benefit plan subsequent to the amendment see footnote to the financial statements 
the company has voluntarily corrected the deficiencies and believes  but cannot assure  that it will not incur any significant penalties or other costs related to the deficiencies 
during fiscal  the company received  related to the class action settlement of in re first databank direct antitrust litigation the class action 
this amount excludes professional  legal fees  and other company borne expenses associated with this action all of which have been fully expensed 
the class action had been brought on behalf of persons who purchased electronic drug information databases containing clinical  pricing  or other information on prescription or non prescription pharmaceutical drugs or services  products or software related thereto collectively  the drug information databases directly from first databank  inc fdb in the united states 
the class action alleged violations of the antitrust laws with respect to the pricing of the drug information databases 
as a purchaser of drug information databases from fdb  the company was entitled to participate in the court approved settlement 
this settlement represents partial reimbursement o f prior period operating costs 
the company had no such settlement in fiscal net income for fiscal year was  compared to a net income for fiscal year of  liquidity and capital resources at june  and as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  and a working capital of  at june  the current ratio at june  was compared to at june  cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the decreased cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the reduction in net earnings and an increase in accounts receivable 
this was partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and depreciation and amortization  and decreased deferred income tax charges 
as of june   accounts receivable increased  to  from  at fiscal year end  and advances from customers increased  to  from  at fiscal year end the increase in advances from customers is due to the expanded customer base related to the industry acceptance of the pharmacy division s worx product and an emphasis on selling support services with annual renewals 
days sales outstanding was and at fiscal year end june  and  respectively 
this increase is a result of longer collection cycles 
the principal uses of cash for investing activities during the fiscal years ended june  and included purchases of fixed assets and investments in product development 
during fiscal  the company spent  on fixed assets including equipment and software as part of routine improvements and replacements to its internal systems  compared to  for fiscal the company capitalized new product devel opment of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the investments in product development were related to the company s ongoing efforts to enhance its products for the blood bank  pharmacy and operating room divisions 
the company plans to continue to review market expansion opportunities through internal development and or the acquisition of products companies that complement or augment the existing line of products 
the company received  and  in fiscal and upon the exercise of stock options 
the company received proceeds of  from the issuance of a note payable  and made principal payments of  on the note payable during fiscal the company s liquidity is influenced by its ability to perform on a best of breed basis in a competitive industry that is currently impacted by consolidations of healthcare information system providers 
the factors that may affect liquidity are the company s ability to penetrate the market for its products  maintain or reduce the length of the selling cycle  and collect cash from clients as systems are implemented 
exclusive of activities involving any future acquisitions of products or companies that complement or augment the company s existing line of products  management believes that current available funds and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for the foreseeable future

 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recogniti on criteria 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin no

factors that may affect future results fluctuations in quarterly operating results mediware s revenues and results of operations can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
system sales revenues in any quarter depend substantially upon mediware s sales performance and the customer s budgeting and buying practices 
system sales in any quarter may fluctuate due to contract activity  demand for the company s products and services  lengthy and complex sales cycles  and the customer s internal budgets for new technology systems and technical resources to deploy them 
additionally  the terms of a final contract may materially affect the company s ability to recognize anticipated quarterly revenues 
factors include  but are not limited to  the following systems contracts may include both currently deliverable and non deliverable software products 
customer needs for services that include significant modifications  customization or complex interfaces that could delay product delivery or acceptance 
customer specific acceptance criteria 
payment terms that are long term or depend upon contingencies 
reliance on third party software mediware licenses various third party software products that it incorporates into its own software products 
these products may include operating systems  relational database management systems  knowledge clinical databases and other key systems 
the termination by any third party vendor of mediware s licenses to use these products  or a significant change to a relied upon product  could have a material adverse effect on mediware s operations 
changes that could have a material adverse effect include  for example  the third party products becoming inoperable  features and functions becoming unavailable  product performance being materially reduced  or unfavorable pricing changes 
although alternate software products are available  mediware could incur substantial costs if it is required to adapt its products to alternative third party software products 
dependence on third party marketing relationships mediware s continued growth depends on its ability to build and maintain strong marketing partnerships 
the company believes its marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by these relationships 
mediware has had marketing partnerships with certain laboratory or hospital information system software vendors who also are competitors of mediware 
laboratory and hospital information system software vendors are responding to the growing demand within the market to offer more fully integrated solutions to hospitals 
given this dynamic  these vendors may choose to either develop stronger partnering relationships with clinical software providers like mediware or decide to develop their own solutions 
in the event that these marketing relationships are discontinued  the company could experience a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare industry is heavily regulated by various governmental and regulatory bodies 
the decisions made and initiatives promulgated by these bodies may significantly influence operations of hospitals and healthcare organizations 
their influence affects purchasing and investment decisions by hospitals  which could impact negotiations with the company 
many hospitals are consolidating and forming or becoming part of integrated healthcare delivery networks ihdns 
the formation of ihdns might reduce the number of discrete prospects the company may target and could provide more negotiating leverage to the company s prospective customers 
these events  if they occurred  could result in a reduction of selling prices  an increase in the length of the sales cycle  or other situations that could negatively affect the company 
significant competition the market for healthcare information systems is extremely competitive 
some of the company s competitors are siemens ag  mckesson corporation  eclypsis corporation  misys plc  global med technologies  inc  scc soft computer  cerner corporation and ge healthcare  each of which offer products that compete with certain offerings of the company 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  sales and marketing resources 
a number of factors determine success or failure in this market  including the functionality of the software  the quality of client references  the underlying technical architecture  the financial stability of the software provider  the ongoing support of the system  and the quality and quantity of the sales organization 
the company s ability to maintain a positive stance in all of the above areas will affect its ability to compete successfully 
managing growth mediware s ability to manage future growth is partly dependent on the ability to recruit  train and retain employees that possess industry specific expertise 
the company has experienced significant growth in service related revenues  customer base and product development activity 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in new product development in all divisions 
mediware s success will partially depend upon its ability to recruit  manage and maintain appropriate staffing levels of technical and industry expertise to meet customer needs and service new sales 
the market for such personnel is highly competitive  making it difficult to adjust staffing timely in reaction to fluctuations in sales activity 
government regulation the hospitals that comprise the primary market for the company s products must comply with various federal  state and local statutes and regulations 
the adequacy of blood bank information management and record keeping products are subject to regulation  inspection and review by the fda 
the company s blood bank products are regulated as medical devices by the fda 
blood bank software vendors are also subject to the fda s quality systems regulations qsr 
although mediware is continually updating and improving its internal quality system to ensure compliance with new federal rules and guidelines  mediware cannot predict whether it will be fully in compliance with these guidelines or any future guidelines  regulations or inspection procedures 
non compliance with any such guidelines  regulations or procedures could have a material adverse effect on the operations of clinical information system vendors of blood bank information systems  including mediware 
the fda modernization act of was enacted on november  and became effective on february  under this legislation  the fda is directed to consider the extent to which reliance on post market controls could expedite the pre market notification review process and the classification of devices 
the legislation also requires the fda to ensure that good manufacturing practices conform  to the extent practicable  to internationally recognized standards for medical devices 
neither of these provisions appears on its face to contemplate regulation which would have a material adverse effect on the company s blood bank information system operations  however  the legislation expanded the jurisdiction of the fda and the company remains unable to predict the effect of any resulting applicable future regulation 
if any of the company s existing products or future products become subject to congressional or governmental agency efforts to establish or expand governmental agency jurisdiction  complianc e would likely be costly and time consuming 
however  the company believes it could have a competitive advantage if the fda regulations apply to cord blood stem cells  tissue or other biologic products 
during fiscal  mediware s hemocare registered facility was inspected by the fda 
the inspection noted that several customers used an outdated hemocare version 
in a mutually agreed upon initiative with the fda  mediware issued corrective action to assist its customers with their upgrade to hemocare version this action is currently ongoing with approximately of hemocare customers now upgraded 
during fiscal  the company received its initial hcll k product clearance from the fda 
this clearance opened the way for the company to begin marketing hcll 
all fda regulated products are required to obtain additional k clearance as new functionality is added 
during fiscal  the company received two additional k clearances for hcll 
the company has dedicated substantial time and resources to comply with applicable guidelines and regulations 
the fda enforces compliance by such actions as recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and criminal prosecutions 
unsatisfactory compliance and the inability to timely remedy any non compliance  resulting in any of the above actions  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new regulations relating to patient confidentiality the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa mandates significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment governing the provision of health benefits  the delivery of and payment for healthcare services  and the security and confidentiality of individually identifiable  protected health information in written  electronic or oral formats 
the department of health and human services adopted final rules implementing hipaa 
the final rules include standards for the security of electronic health information and the privacy of a patient s medical records and became effective on february  and april   respectively 
most healthcare providers  healthcare clearinghouses and health plans covered entities are required to comply 
covered entities are required to comply with the standards for security by april  and have been required to comply with the standards for privacy since april  although the c ompany is not a covered entity  most of the company s customers are covered entities 
as covered entities  the company s customers are required to flow down certain of their obligations under hipaa to their service providers 
accordingly  the company has been required to adopt different and or additional procedures 
in addition  the company has had increased legal expenses associated with negotiating agreements with existing and new customers to implement the new hipaa obligations 
in light of the new obligations under hipaa  covered entities may be required or may choose to reevaluate their technology solutions 
the company may be required to invest in its products and procedures to maintain compliance 
in addition  many states have passed or are evaluating local versions of hipaa 
the company believes  but cannot assure  that hipaa will not materially affect the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
product related liabilities all of the company s products provide data for use by healthcare providers in patient care settings 
mediware s license agreements generally contain provisions to limit exposure to product related claims 
these provisions  however  may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or may not adequately limit the company s exposure 
the company maintains product liability insurance at an amount it believes adequate for its intended purpose  however  there can be no assurances that the insurance will cover a claim brought against the company 
although no claims have been brought against the company to date for injuries related to the use of its products  there is a risk that such claims could be pursued 
a successful claim brought against the company  not covered by insurance or greater than the insured limits  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
system errors and warranties despite testing by mediware  software products as complex as those offered by the company and used in a wide range of clinical and health information systems settings are likely to contain a number of errors or bugs  especially early in their product life cycle 
the company s products are clinical information systems used in patient care settings where a low tolerance for bugs exists 
testing of products is difficult due to the wide range of environments the systems are installed in 
due to these factors  there is no assurance that the discovery of defects or errors will not cause delays in product delivery  poor client references  payment disputes  contract cancellations  or additional expenses and payments to rectify problems 
any of these factors may delay acceptance of products  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights  proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims 
the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  license and marketing agreements  and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary information 
generally  the company has not historically filed patent applications or copyrights covering its software technology
