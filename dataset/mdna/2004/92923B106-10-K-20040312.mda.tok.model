item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
overview our primary sources of revenue are net interest income and noninterest income 
net interest income is the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we generate interest income from our loan portfolio and short term investments 
we fund our loan portfolio with securitizations  lines of credit  notes payable to the bank and equity 
noninterest income is primarily made up of revenues generated from the sale and servicing of contracts 
the primary components of noninterest income include late charges and other collection related fee income on managed contracts  retained interest income or expense  gain on sale of contracts  and contractual servicing income on contracts in securitization transactions treated as sales for accounting purposes 
since march  we have structured our securitizations as secured financings and no longer record non cash gain on sale at the time of each securitization or record subsequent contractual servicing and retained interest income  the valuation of which is based upon subjective assumptions 
rather  the earnings of the contracts in the trust and the related financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of contracts as net interest income 
in addition  our provision for credit losses has increased as we hold securitized loans on our balance sheet 
our decision to account for our securitizations as secured financings rather than as sales was based upon a business philosophy that focuses on presenting high quality  cash based earnings and maintaining a conservative  well capitalized balance sheet 
we believe that a presentation in which assets and liabilities remain on the balance sheet for securitization transactions treated as secured financings provides a better understanding of our business and the inherent risks associated with our securitizations 
since march  in order to account for some of our securitizations as secured financings rather than as sales  those securitizations include a provision that provides us with the right to repurchase contracts at any time as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the percentage of contracts that we may repurchase was increased from to as of march other securitization transactions since march allow the securitization trust to invest in and sell other financial assets 
we believe that our decision to make these accounting changes created a transitional period during which our earnings were adversely impacted as we built our on balance sheet portfolio of loans 
this change affects the comparability of our financial statements from through for more than years  we believe that our business model has been successful in a variety of environments 
nationwide recession  high unemployment  weak wholesale auction values  record personal bankruptcies and record low interest rates created a challenging operating landscape in through it all  we kept credit losses under control  maintained strong net interest margins and leveraged our operating platform to produce record net income 
the following are highlights for we produced record earnings of million in net income  a increase over earnings per share increased to a record per share 
net interest income rose to million while risk adjusted spreads were nearly identical to credit losses declined in to of contracts 
operating expenses represent of average managed contracts  our most efficient year ever 
we originated billion in automobile contracts through our relationships with  dealers throughout the country 
our portfolio of automobile contracts of billion consists of more than prime credit quality contracts 

table of contents delinquencies at year end were of total outstanding contracts  which is lower than a year earlier 
we successfully expanded our securitization program by offering senior subordinated securities on a regular basis 
we currently manage over billion of securities outstanding under our securitization program 
business risks our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following business risks 
in addition to the risks described below  we may encounter risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  which may also impair our business operations 
regulatory requirements may restrict our ability to do business the bank and its subsidiaries are subject to inspection and regulation by the ots pursuant to hola 
the ots is the primary federal banking agency responsible for its supervision and regulation 
the ots has the power to enforce hola and its regulations by a variety of actions ranging from a memorandum of understanding to cease and desist proceedings under the federal deposit insurance act 
the ots can take such action based solely upon its determination that we have violated one or more of the laws or regulations to which we are subject or that any aspect of our business is being conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner 
as such  the ots has broad powers to  among other things  require us to change our business practices  hold additional capital and change management 
such action could have a material adverse impact on our business and may impact our securities prices  including our common stock  and access to the capital markets 
hola limits the amount of our consumer loans  commercial loans and investment in service corporations 
see business supervision and regulation investment restrictions 
our securitization activities are structured to enable the bank to remove securitized automobile contracts from the hola consumer loan limitation calculation 
changes in the ots s interpretation of hola as it affects our securitization activities could cause us to change the manner in which we securitize automobile contracts or to limit our acquisition of such contracts  thereby negatively impacting the price of our common stock 
furthermore  if we are unable to continue to securitize the automobile contracts we purchase  this regulatory limitation may force us to limit our acquisition of new automobile contracts  thereby adversely affecting our ability to remain a preferred source of financing for the dealers from whom we purchase automobile contracts  or cause the bank to fail the regulatory limitations 
any such limitations may also have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
in addition  other regulatory actions taken by the ots could have a negative impact on the price of our common stock 
ots guidance regarding subprime lending may affect the bank s capital requirements the ots  along with other federal banking regulatory agencies  has adopted guidance pertaining to subprime lending programs 
pursuant to the guidance  lending programs which provide credit to borrowers whose credit histories reflect specified negative characteristics  such as recent bankruptcies or payment delinquencies  are deemed to be subprime lending programs for regulatory purposes 
many of the contracts that we originate possess one or more of the factors identified in the guidance as indicative of a subprime loan for this purpose 
pursuant to the guidance  examiners may require that an institution with a lending program deemed to be subprime hold additional capital that ranges from one and one half to three times the normal capital required for similar loans made to borrowers who are not deemed to be subprime borrowers 
because many of the automobile contracts we originate possess one or more of the factors identified in the guidance as indicative of a subprime loan  the bank maintains its capital levels higher than would otherwise be required by regulations 
maintenance of higher capital levels by the bank may slow our growth  require us to raise additional capital or sell assets  all of which could negatively impact our earnings 
we cannot predict to what extent the bank may be required to hold additional capital with respect to those automobile contracts we hold as to which the borrowers are deemed by the ots to be subprime borrowers 

table of contents other regulatory requirements may affect our ability to do business our operations are subject to regulation  supervision and licensing under various federal  state and local statutes  ordinances and regulations 
in most states in which we operate  a consumer credit regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to consumer lenders and sales finance agencies such as us 
these rules and regulations generally provide for licensing of sales finance agencies  limitations on the amount  duration and charges  including interest rates  for various categories of loans  requirements as to the form and content of finance contracts and other documentation  and restrictions on collection practices and creditors rights 
so long as we are an operating subsidiary of the bank  licensing and certain other of these requirements are not applicable to us due to federal preemption 
we are also subject to extensive federal regulation  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair credit reporting act 
these laws require us to provide certain disclosures to prospective borrowers and protect against discriminatory lending practices and unfair credit practices 
the principal disclosures required under the truth in lending act include the terms of repayment  the total finance charge and the annual percentage rate charged on each loan 
the equal credit opportunity act prohibits creditors from discriminating against loan applicants on the basis of race  color  sex  age or marital status 
pursuant to regulation b promulgated under the equal credit opportunity act  creditors are required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for the rejection 
in addition  the credit scoring system we use must comply with the requirements for such a system as set forth in the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b 
the fair credit reporting act requires us to provide certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer reporting agency 
additionally  we are subject to the gramm leach bliley act  which requires us to maintain privacy with respect to certain consumer data in our possession and to periodically communicate with consumers on privacy matters 
we are also subject to the servicemembers civil relief act  and similar state laws  which requires us to reduce the interest rate charged on each loan to customers who have subsequently joined the military 
the dealers that originate automobile contracts we purchase also must comply with both state and federal credit and trade practice statutes and regulations 
failure of the dealers to comply with these statutes and regulations could result in consumers having rights of rescission and other remedies that could have an adverse effect on us 
we believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable local  state and federal regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits  and the failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
further  the adoption of additional  or the revision of existing  rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the bank is subject to routine periodic examinations by the ots on a variety of financial and regulatory matters 
the bank s most recent annual safety and soundness examination by the ots was completed in july adverse economic conditions may impact our profitability delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and credit losses generally increase during periods of economic slowdown  recession or higher unemployment 
these periods also may be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding contracts  which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of loss in the event of default 
significant increases in the inventory of pre owned automobiles during periods of economic recession also may depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales 
because a portion of our borrowers are considered non prime borrowers  the actual rates of delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and credit losses on these contracts are higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry for borrowers considered to be prime borrowers and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn 
in addition  during an economic slowdown or recession  our servicing costs may increase 
table of contents without a corresponding increase in our servicing fee income 
while we seek to manage the higher risk inherent in non prime contracts through the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ  we cannot assure you that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  defaults  repossessions  credit losses or servicing costs could adversely affect our financial position  liquidity and results of operations and our ability to enter into future securitizations 
interest rate fluctuations may impact our profitability our profitability may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates  which affects the gross interest rate spread we earn on our contracts 
as interest rates change  our gross interest rate spread on new originations may increase or decrease depending upon the interest rate environment 
in addition  the rates charged on the contracts originated or purchased from dealers are limited by statutory maximums  restricting our opportunity to pass on increased interest costs 
we believe that our profitability and liquidity could be adversely affected during any period of changing interest rates  possibly to a material degree 
we monitor the interest rate environment and employ our hedging strategies designed to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our hedging strategies will mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates 
wholesale auction values may impact our profitability we sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the united states 
auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles and other recoveries usually do not cover the outstanding balance of the contracts  and the resulting deficiencies are charged off 
decreased auction proceeds resulting from the depressed prices at which pre owned automobiles may be sold during periods of economic slowdown or recession will result in higher credit losses for us 
furthermore  depressed wholesale prices for pre owned automobiles may result from significant liquidations of rental or fleet inventories and from increased volume of trade ins due to promotional financing programs offered by new vehicle manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that our recovery rates will stabilize or improve in the future 
the ownership of our common stock is concentrated  which may result in conflicts of interest and actions that are not in the best interests of our other stockholders ernest s 
rady is the founder  chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of westcorp 
mr 
rady is also the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the bank and is our chairman of the board of directors 
mr 
rady is the beneficial owner of approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of westcorp and is able to exercise significant control over our company 
the westcorp common stock ownership of mr 
rady enables him to elect all of westcorp s directors and effectively control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of westcorp  including mergers  sales of all or substantially all of our assets  going private transactions  conversions and other corporate restructurings or reorganizations 
because of the significant block of westcorp common stock controlled by mr 
rady  decisions may be made that  while in the best interest of mr 
rady  may not be in the best interest of other stockholders 
we may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows to run our automobile finance operations our automobile finance operations require substantial operating cash flows 
operating cash requirements include premiums paid to dealers for acquisition of automobile contracts  expenses incurred in connection with the securitization of automobile contracts  capital expenditures for new technologies and ongoing operating costs 
our primary source of operating cash is the excess cash flows received from securitizations and contracts held on the balance sheet 
the timing and amount of excess cash flows from contracts varies based on a number of factors  including the rates and amounts of loan delinquencies  defaults and net credit losses  how quickly and at what price repossessed vehicles can be resold  
table of contents the ages of the contracts in the portfolio  levels of voluntary prepayments  and the terms of our securitizations  which include performance based triggers requiring higher levels of credit enhancements to the extent credit losses or delinquencies exceed certain thresholds 
we have exceeded performance thresholds in the past and may do so again in the future 
any adverse change in these factors could reduce or eliminate excess cash flows to us 
although we currently have positive operating cash flows  we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate positive cash flows in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
changes in our securitization program could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings our business depends on our ability to aggregate and sell automobile contracts in the form of asset backed securities 
these sales generate cash proceeds that allow us to repay amounts borrowed and to purchase additional automobile contracts 
changes in our asset backed securities program could materially adversely affect our earnings or ability to purchase and resell automobile contracts on a timely basis 
such changes could include  among other things  a delay in the completion of a planned securitization  negative market perception of us  and failure of the automobile contracts we intend to sell to conform to insurance company and rating agency requirements 
if we are unable to effectively securitize our automobile contracts  we may have to reduce or even curtail our automobile contract purchasing activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
we expect our operating results to continue to fluctuate  which may adversely impact our business our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future 
factors that could affect our quarterly earnings include variations in the volume of automobile contracts originated  which historically tend to be lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year  interest rate spreads  the effectiveness of our hedging strategies  credit losses  which historically tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters of the year  amount and timing of whole loan sale transactions  and operating costs 
critical accounting policies management believes critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require difficult and complex judgments because they rely on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to the impact of changing market conditions 
the following is a summary of accounting policies we consider critical 
securitization transactions and whole loan sales contracts sold by us to our special purpose entity subsidiaries in connection with securitization transactions are treated as having been sold for bankruptcy purposes 
the subsequent transfer of such 
table of contents contracts to the securitization trust is treated as a secured financing under generally accepted accounting principles  also known as gaap 
for gaap purposes  the contracts are retained on the balance sheet with the securities issued to finance the contracts recorded as notes payable on automobile secured financing 
we record interest income on the securitized contracts and interest expense on the notes issued through the securitization transactions 
we occasionally sell contracts to westcorp in whole loan sales 
we recognize a cash gain on a whole loan sale equal to the cash premium received adjusted for the write off of dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
as servicer of these contracts  we hold and remit funds collected from the borrowers on behalf of the trustee pursuant to reinvestment contracts that we have entered into or we may send funds to a trustee to be held until the distribution dates  depending on the terms of our securitizations 
for loans sold in securitization transactions that were treated as sales and loans sold to westcorp that we continue to service  these amounts are reported as amounts held on behalf of trustee on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
allowance for credit losses management determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses based on a review of various quantitative and qualitative analyses 
quantitative analyses include the review of chargeoff trends by loan program and loan type  analysis of cumulative losses and evaluation of credit loss experience by credit tier and geographic location 
other quantitative analyses include the evaluation of the size of any particular asset group  the concentration of any credit tier  the level of nonperformance and the percentage of delinquency 
qualitative analyses include trends in chargeoffs over various time periods and at various statistical midpoints and high points  the severity of depreciated values of repossessions or foreclosures  trends in the number of days repossessions are held in inventory  trends in the number of loan modifications  trends in delinquency roll rates  trends in deficiency balance collections both internally and from collection agencies  trends in custom scores and the effectiveness of our custom scores and trends in the economy generally or in specific geographic locations 
despite these analyses  we recognize that establishing allowance for credit losses is not an exact science and can be highly judgmental in nature 
the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is not only dependent upon effective quantitative and qualitative analyses  but also effective loan review and asset classification 
we classify our assets in accordance with regulatory guidance into five categories pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
based upon our asset classifications  we establish general and specific valuation allowances 
general valuation allowances are determined by applying various factors to loan balances that are classified as pass  special mention  substandard or doubtful 
specific valuation allowances represent loan amounts that are classified as loss 
some assets may be split into more than one asset classification due to fair value or net realizable value calculations 
all contracts that are to days delinquent are automatically classified as special mention 
any contract that is or more days delinquent is automatically classified as substandard 
any contract where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or the vehicle has been repossessed by us and is subject to a redemption period is classified as substandard  with the difference between the wholesale book value and contract balance classified as loss 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the loans  by reversing the allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses when the amount of loans held on balance sheet is reduced through securitization transactions treated as sales and whole loan sales  or based on credit trends or economic conditions 

table of contents derivatives and hedging activities the contracts originated and held by us are fixed rate and  accordingly  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitization transactions  we may enter into various hedge agreements prior to closing the transaction 
the market value of these hedge agreements is designed to respond inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses on these agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recognized in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
upon completion of the securitization transaction  the gains or losses are recognized in full as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts if the transaction is treated as a sale or amortized on a level yield basis over the duration of the notes issued if the transaction is treated as a secured financing 
if we issue variable rate notes payable in connection with our securitization activities  we may also enter into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our variable interest rate exposure on future interest payments 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in notes payable on automobile secured financing  and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recorded in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
related interest income or expense is settled on a monthly or quarterly basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we may also enter into interest rate swap agreements or other derivatives that we choose not to designate as hedges or that do not qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  also known as sfas no 
these derivatives pertain to variable rate notes issued in conjunction with the securitization of our contracts 
any change in the market value of such derivatives and income or expense recognized on such derivatives is recorded to noninterest income 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to april   our securitization transactions were structured as sales for accounting purposes 
under this structure the notes issued by our unconsolidated securitization trusts were not recorded as a liability on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
effective january   we regained control over assets of the securitization trusts for all of our outstanding securitization transactions treated as sales for accounting purposes  excluding loans sold in whole loan sales 
we recorded million of automobile contracts and the related notes payable on automobile secured financing on our consolidated statements of financial condition and have eliminated all remaining off balance sheet amounts related to these transactions 
at december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is affected by our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the rate earned on our interest earning assets and the rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income for the past three years is primarily the result of us holding a greater percentage of contracts on balance sheet even as overall net interest margins declined

the total interest rate spread decreased basis points in compared with due to a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points and a decrease in the cost of funds of basis points 
the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets is due primarily to originating a higher percentage of prime credit quality contracts and a lower interest rate environment 
the decrease in the cost of funds is due primarily to a lower interest rate environment 

table of contents the following table sets forth the changes in net interest income attributable to changes in volume change in average portfolio volume multiplied by prior period average rate and changes in rates change in weighted average interest rate multiplied by prior period average portfolio balance compared to compared to volume rate total volume rate total dollars in thousands increase decrease in interest income contracts receivable investment securities total interest income increase decrease in interest expense lines of credit parent notes payable parent notes payable on automobile secured financing other total interest expense increase in net interest income in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate  the changes due to the volume rate variance the combined effect of change in weighted average interest rate and change in average portfolio balance were allocated proportionately based on the absolute value of the volume and rate variances 
if there was no balance in the previous year  the total change was allocated to volume 
provision for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses to cover probable losses that can be reasonably estimated for contracts held on the balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on such contracts or by reversing the allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses when the amount of contracts held on balance sheet is reduced through securitization transactions treated as sales and from whole loan sales 
the level of the allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of contracts held on balance sheet and historical loss trends 
we believe that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb probable losses in our owned portfolio that can be reasonably estimated 
the provision for credit losses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net chargeoffs were million  million and million for the same respective periods 
the decrease in provision for credit losses from to was the result of holding a greater percentage of prime credit quality contracts  which require a lower percentage of allowance for credit losses 
the increase in the provision for credit losses from to was the result of a greater amount of contracts held on balance sheet 

table of contents noninterest income automobile lending income since the first quarter of  we have not completed a securitization that has been accounted for as an off balance sheet arrangement 
for transactions treated as off balance sheet arrangements prior to april  we recorded a non cash gain equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the portfolio of contracts sold less the write off of dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
for these securitizations  net interest earned on the contracts sold was recognized over the life of the transactions as contractual servicing income and retained interest income or expense 
effective january   we regained control over assets of the securitization trusts for all of our outstanding securitization transactions treated as sales for accounting purposes  excluding loans sold in whole loan sales 
we no longer recognize retained interest income or expense or contractual servicing income for these securitization transactions on our consolidated statements of income 
rather  we recognize interest income on automobile contracts held in these trusts and record interest expense on notes payable on automobile secured financings 
we occasionally sell contracts to westcorp in whole loan sales 
these contracts are subsequently securitized by westcorp and continue to be managed by us under the terms of such securitizations 
we recognize a cash gain on a whole loan sale equal to the cash premium received adjusted for the write off of dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
additionally  we recognize contractual servicing income on these contracts 
the components of servicing income were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands fee income contractual servicing income retained interest expense  net of risa amortization total servicing income fee income consists primarily of documentation fees  late charges and deferment fees on our managed portfolio  including contracts securitized in transactions accounted for as sales and secured financings  as well as contracts sold in whole loan sales and contracts not securitized 
the increase in fee income is due to the growth in our average managed portfolio to billion in from billion in and billion in according to the terms of each securitization  we earn contractual servicing income on the outstanding balance of securitized contracts 
for accounting purposes  this income is only recognized on contracts sold through securitizations treated as sales and whole loan sales 
contractual servicing income earned by us relating to sales to securitization trusts totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no contractual servicing income earned by us relating to sales to securitization trusts for the year ended december  the decline was due to our transition to treating our securitizations as secured financings rather than as sales as well as our regaining control over the assets of the trusts for all our outstanding securitization transactions previously treated as sales for accounting purposes 
contractual servicing income earned by us relating to the whole loan sales to westcorp totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the average balance of the sold portfolio  excluding the loans sold in whole loan sales on which we do not recognize retained interest income  was million in there was no retained interest expense for the year ended december  as a result of reconsolidating all remaining off balance sheet trusts on january  for accounting purposes  this expense is recognized only on contracts sold through securitizations treated as sales 
retained interest expense is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold  credit losses  the size of the sold portfolio and the amount of amortization of the risa 
the 
table of contents retained interest expense recognized in and was the result of higher chargeoffs on our sold portfolio as well as revised estimates of further chargeoffs due to continued slowing in the economy 
net chargeoffs on the sold portfolio were million in and million in the outstanding sold portfolio had a weighted average gross interest rate spread of and in and  respectively

redeemed on january  redeemed on february  represents loans sold to westcorp and subsequently securitized by westcorp 
we manage these contracts pursuant to an agreement with westcorp and the securitization trust 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operating expenses as a percentage of average managed contracts were in compared with in and in the improvement in operating efficiencies from to was achieved through the centralization and automation of certain processes as well as the deployment of new technologies 
the efficiencies realized include increasing the conversion ratios on contracts purchased through dealer education  automating the loan application and underwriting system  increasing the percentage of applications received via the internet  outsourcing the data entry process  centralizing the verification process  and implementing proprietary credit scorecards and electronic funds transfers for our dealers 
operating efficiencies also include implementing automated dialers  centralizing and upgrading payment processing and asset recovery processes  upgrading toll free lines for customer service and interactive voice response technology  implementing direct debit for our borrowers  imaging for record retention and retrieval  and implementing a new behavioral scoring collection system 
currently  we pay a monthly management fee to the bank and westcorp  which covers various administrative expenses 
additionally  the bank and westcorp pay fees to us for information technology and other services 
the management fee is based on the actual costs incurred and estimates of actual usage 
we believe that the management fee approximates the cost to perform these services on our own behalf or to acquire them from third parties 
we have the option under the management agreements to procure these services on our own should it be more economically beneficial for us to do so 
see business transactions with related parties management agreements 
income taxes we file federal and certain state tax returns as part of a consolidated group that includes the bank and westcorp 
we file other state tax returns as a separate entity 
tax liabilities from the consolidated returns are allocated in accordance with a tax sharing agreement based on the relative income or loss of each entity on a stand alone basis 
our effective tax rate was approximately in compared with in and in the relatively lower effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a result of a one time benefit of new legislation enacted by the state of california that eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debts for large banks and financial corporations for taxable income purposes for tax years after january  in the first year of this change  of the ending reserve amount deducted from taxable income in prior periods was included in california taxable income 
the remaining of the reserve was not required to be recaptured into income but rather represented a permanent difference between gaap and california tax accounting 
the deferred tax liability related to this permanent difference was eliminated from our balance sheet and the state income tax provision for was reduced accordingly 
see business transactions with related parties tax sharing agreement 
financial condition overview we originated billion and billion of contracts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of higher contract originations  our portfolio of managed contracts reached billion at december   up from billion at december  amounts due from trusts the excess cash flows generated by contracts sold to each of the securitization trusts are deposited into spread accounts in the name of the trustee under the terms of the securitizations

the amounts due from trusts represent initial advances made to spread accounts and excess cash flows that were still under obligation to be held in the spread accounts for securitizations treated as sales 
there were no amounts due from trusts at december  compared with million at december  the decrease is the result of us regaining control over the assets of the trusts for all our outstanding securitizations treated as sales for accounting purposes  excluding loans sold to westcorp and subsequently securitized by westcorp 
retained interest in securitized assets none of our securitization transactions in  or were treated as sales

npas were million at december  compared with million at december  npas represented of total assets at december  compared with at december  there were no impaired loans at december  or allowance for credit losses our allowance for credit losses was million at december  compared with million at december  we have decreased our percentage of allowance for credit losses from at december  to at december  as we have originated a higher percentage of prime credit quality contracts 
based on the analyses we performed related to the allowance for credit losses as described under critical accounting polices  we believe that our allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to cover probable losses in our contract portfolio that can be reasonably estimated

our ability to maintain positive cash flows from operations is the result of consistent managed growth  favorable loss experience and efficient operations 
principal sources of cash contract sales and securitizations our primary source of funds is the ability to aggregate and securitize contracts in the form of asset backed securities or sell contracts through whole loan sales 
these transactions generate cash proceeds that allow us to repay amounts borrowed and to purchase additional contracts 
since  we have sold or 
table of contents securitized over billion of automobile contracts in public offerings  making us the fourth largest issuer by dollar amount of such securities in the nation 
collections of principal and interest from contracts and release of cash from spread accounts the collection of principal and interest from contracts originated and securitized and the release of cash from spread accounts is another significant source of funds for us 
collections of principal and interest are deposited into collection accounts established in connection with each securitization or into our accounts for non securitized contracts 
pursuant to reinvestment contracts entered into in connection with securitizations guaranteed under a financial guarantee insurance policy issued by fsa  we receive access to the amounts deposited into collection accounts and amounts held in the spread accounts for these securitizations 
we use those amounts so received in our daily operations to fund the purchase of contracts or to cover the day to day costs of our operations 
if delinquency or chargeoff rates in a securitization exceed established triggers  amounts required to be held in spread accounts will increase  requiring additional pledged collateral 
we may bear additional expense due to an increase in required collateral 
if the reinvestment contracts were no longer deemed an eligible investment  which determination would be made by the rating agencies or fsa  we would no longer have the ability to use this cash in the ordinary course of business and would need to obtain alternative financing  which may only be available on less attractive terms 
see business transactions with related parties reinvestment contracts 
if we were unable to obtain additional financing  we may have to curtail our contract purchasing activities  which would also have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
also  a significant increase in credit losses could have a material adverse impact on our collections of principal and interest from contracts 
pursuant to the securitization agreements for our securitizations that are credit enhanced through the issuance of subordinated notes  we receive cash released from the trustee from the spread accounts on such transactions once the spread accounts reach predetermined funding levels 
the amounts released from these spread accounts represent the return of the initial deposits to such accounts as well as the release of excess spread on the securitized contracts 
principal and interest collections on contracts owned by us and contracts securitized under a financial guarantee insurance policy issued by an unaffiliated third party company and release of cash from spread accounts on securitizations that are credit enhanced through the issuance of subordinated notes totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in principal and interest collections is primarily due to an increase in the amount of contracts managed 
borrowings from parent our parent company is a federally insured savings institution 
it has the ability to raise significant amounts of liquidity by attracting both short term and long term deposits from the general public  commercial enterprises and institutions by offering a variety of accounts and rates 
the bank may also raise funds by issuing commercial paper  obtaining advances from the federal home loan bank  also known as the fhlb  and selling securities under agreements to repurchase and utilizing other borrowings 
we are able to utilize these liquidity sources through agreements we have entered into with our parent 
these include notes  lines of credit and the wfs reinvestment contract 
these financing arrangements provide us with another source of liquidity beyond the secondary markets  thereby providing a source of short term funding 
the availability of these financing sources depends upon factors outside of our control  including regulatory issues such as the capital requirements of the bank and availability of funds at the bank 
if the bank were unable to extend this financing to us  we would need to replace it with outside sources 
if we were unable to replace these sources  we would need to curtail our contract purchasing activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and negatively impact our ability to remain a preferred source of financing for the dealers from which we purchase contracts 

table of contents conduit financing we have previously entered into secured conduit financing transactions using an automobile receivable securitization structure for short term financing needs 
for the years ended december  and  we issued million and million of notes secured by contracts through conduit facilities established in january and december  respectively 
we terminated the december facility in march in conjunction with a billion public asset backed securitization 
the january facility was terminated in may in conjunction with a billion public asset backed securitization 
we did not enter into a secured conduit financing in equity offerings we completed rights offerings in march and may which raised million and million of equity through the issuance of million and million additional common shares at a price of and per share  respectively 
with the completion of the march offering  the number of our common shares issued and outstanding increased by to million shares  compared with an increase of to million shares in may of the million and million additional common shares issued in and  the bank purchased million and million shares in the amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   the bank owned of our common stock 
principal uses of cash acquisition of contracts our most significant use of cash is for the acquisition of contracts 
we acquire these contracts through our nationwide relationship with franchised and select independent automobile dealers 
we purchased billion of contracts in compared with billion in and billion in payments of principal and interest on securitizations under the terms of our reinvestment contract on securitizations guaranteed under a financial guarantee insurance policy issued by fsa  we fund quarterly payments of interest and principal to these security holders derived from the cash flows received on the securitized contracts that we service 
payments of principal and interest to security holders totaled billion in compared with billion and billion in and  respectively 
payments of principal and interest in included billion of payments on conduit financings 
amounts paid to dealers consistent with industry practice  we generally pay dealer participation to the originating dealer for each contract purchased 
participation paid to dealers during totaled million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
typically  the acquisition of contracts higher up the prime credit quality spectrum requires a higher amount of participation paid to the dealer due to increased level of competition for such contracts 
the amount of participation paid to dealers increased primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of contracts purchased 
advances to spread accounts at the time a securitization transaction closes  we are required to advance monies to initially fund the spread account 
on senior subordinated securitizations  the spread account balance is invested in eligible mutual fund investments by the trustee 
the advanced monies are included in restricted cash on our consolidated statements of financial condition

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk fluctuations in interest rates and early prepayment of contracts are the primary market risks facing us 
the credit and pricing committee is responsible for setting credit and pricing policies and for monitoring credit quality 
our asset liability committee is responsible for the management of interest rate and prepayment risks 
asset liability management is the process of measuring and controlling interest rate risk through matching the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities 
the asset liability committee closely monitors interest rate and prepayment risks on a consolidated basis with our parent and recommends policies for managing such risks 
the primary measurement tool for evaluating this risk is the use of interest rate shock analysis 
this analysis simulates the effects of an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points on our assets and liabilities and measures the resulting increase or decrease to our net portfolio value  also known as npv 
npv is the discounted value of the future cash flows or paths of cash flows in the presence of options based on volatility assumptions and an arbitrage free monte carlo simulation method to achieve the current market price of all assets minus all liabilities whose value is affected by interest rate changes plus the book value of non interest rate sensitive assets minus the book value of non interest rate sensitive liabilities 
it should be noted that shock analysis is objective but not entirely realistic in that it assumes an instantaneous and isolated set of events 
the npv ratio is the ratio of the npv to the market value of our assets as calculated above 
in general  an increase in interest rates would more adversely affect our npv than would a decrease in interest rates 
the contracts originated and held by us are fixed rate and  accordingly  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitization transactions  we may enter into various hedge agreements prior to closing the transaction 
we enter into euro dollar future contracts and forward agreements in order to hedge our future interest payments on our notes payable on automobile secured financing 
the market value of these hedge agreements is designed to respond inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses on these agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recognized in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
upon completion of the securitization transaction  the gains or losses are recognized in full as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts if the securitization transaction is treated as a sale or amortized on a level yield basis over the duration of the notes issued if the transaction is treated as a secured financing 
these hedge instruments are settled daily  and therefore  there are no related financial instruments recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
credit risk related to these hedge instruments is minimal 
as a result of our approach to interest rate risk management and our hedging strategies  we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will materially affect our results of operations or liquidity  although we can provide no assurance 
as we issued certain variable rate notes payable in connection with our securitization activities  we also entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our variable interest rate exposure on future interest payments 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in notes payable on automobile secured financing  and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recorded in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements or other derivatives that we choose not to designate as hedges or that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
these derivatives pertain to variable rate notes issued in conjunction with the securitization of our contracts 
any change in the market value of such derivatives and any income or expense recognized on such derivatives is recorded to noninterest income 

table of contents the asset liability committee monitors our hedging activities to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by our senior management based upon the monitoring activities of the asset liability committee 
as a result of our approach to interest rate risk management and our hedging strategies  we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will materially affect our results of operations or liquidity  although we can provide no assurance in this regard 
there were no material changes in market risks in the current year compared with the prior year 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for contracts and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of contracts
