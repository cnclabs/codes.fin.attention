item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
executive overview we are the largest non urban provider of general hospital healthcare services in the united states in terms of number of facilities 
for the fiscal year ended december   we generated billion in net operating revenues and million in net income 
we achieved net operating revenue growth of in  in and in we also achieved growth in net income of in  in and in the percentage growth in net income has slowed as a result of the increase in net income in recent years and the impact of discontinuing amortization of goodwill in net income margins expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were in  in and in  after adjusting for goodwill amortization in the increase in net operating revenues in was primarily attributable to the execution of our acquisition strategy  with of the net operating revenue growth in coming from hospitals owned less than one year 
the remaining growth was from hospitals owned throughout both years 
of the increase in net operating revenues from hospitals owned throughout both years  we estimate that approximately was attributable to increases in rates and the acuity level of services provided  was attributable to volume increases and was attributable to increases in government reimbursement 
during  we managed to reduce salaries  benefits and supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues at hospitals owned throughout both years 
the provision for bad debts increased due to the increase in uncollected self pay accounts  primarily caused by an increase in self pay gross revenue in admissions at hospitals owned throughout both years increased in we believe that our growth in admissions in was lower than expected as a result of severe weather in a number of our markets  a loss of admissions from physicians called up for military service  selective service closures at specified hospitals and unusually high cobra utilization in following the increases in unemployment 
in  we did not have a similar level of benefit from cobra utilization 
in addition  we believe the overall economic conditions in led to lower utilization of healthcare service 
we believe our growth in admissions in will improve 
on a consolidated basis  expenses increased as a percentage of net operating revenues primarily as a result of our improvements being offset by those recently acquired hospitals where our strategies to improve profitability have not yet been implemented or where we have not yet fully recognized the benefits of these strategies 
cash flows from operations were millions during compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to the build up of patient accounts receivable at the ten hospitals acquired during at nine of the ten hospitals acquired in  we did not purchase the seller s accounts receivable  which accounted for million in reduction of cash flow from operations 
we generated sufficient cash flow to fund all of our capital expenditures  including replacement hospital construction and physician recruiting expenditures 
acquisitions and dispositions effective january   we acquired seven hospitals located in west tennessee from methodist healthcare corporation of memphis  tennessee in a single purchase transaction 
the aggregate consideration for the seven hospitals was approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in cash and approximately million was assumed in liabilities 
combined licensed beds at these seven facilities total effective july   we acquired pottstown memorial medical center located in pottstown  pennsylvania  approximately miles west of philadelphia and miles east of reading  pennsylvania 
the hospital  which has a total of beds  was acquired from a local not for profit organization 
the consideration for this hospital totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in cash and approximately million was assumed in liabilities 
effective august   we acquired southside regional medical center in petersburg  virginia located miles south of richmond  virginia 
the hospital  which has a total of beds  was acquired from a public hospital authority 
the consideration for this hospital totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in cash and approximately million was assumed in liabilities 
as part of the transaction  we have agreed to build a replacement hospital within five years subject to state certification of need approval 
effective october   the company completed the acquisition of laredo medical center in laredo  texas 
this hospital  which has a total of beds  was acquired from the sisters of mercy health system  in st 
louis  missouri 
the consideration for this hospital totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in cash and approximately million was assumed in liabilities 
effective november   the company sold berrien county hospital licensed beds located in nashville  georgia for approximately million in cash 
in addition  the buyer assumed approximately million of liabilities 
net loss on this transaction was approximately million  net of tax  which included the write off of allocated goodwill of million 
recent development on january   we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission relating to the offer of up to million shares of our common stock to be sold from time to time by affiliates of fl co  the principal stockholder since its acquisition of our predecessor 
affiliates of fl co  currently own million of our shares  or of our outstanding shares 
the million shares being offered represent approximately of fl co 
s beneficial ownership 
other stockholders  including members of management  will have the opportunity to participate with respect to a portion of their shares 
on february  we filed an amendment to the registration statement in which an additional  shares were added to the registration statement to cover the shares to be sold by the other stockholders 
we will not receive any proceeds from any sales of shares by the selling stockholders under the registration statement 
this registration statement has not yet been declared effective 
sources of revenue year ended december  medicare medicaid managed care self pay other third party payors total net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in the periods that such adjustments become known 
adjustments related to final settlements or appeals that increased revenue were insignificant in the periods ended december   and in the future  we expect the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program to increase due to the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  depending upon the diagnosis of a patient s condition 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
reductions in the rate of increase in medicare reimbursement may cause our net operating revenue growth to decline 
effective april   centers for medicare and medicaid services implemented changes to the medicare outpatient prospective payment system 
also beginning april   and extending through march   the consolidated appropriations resolution of and the temporary assistance for needy families block grant extension equalized the rural and urban standardized payment amounts under the medicare inpatient prospective payment system 
along with other changes  this benefit was made permanent when congress passed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of had these and other reimbursement changes been in effect in  we estimate their impact would have increased net operating revenue by less than 
although the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of provides a broad range of provider payment benefits  federal government spending in excess of federal budgetary provisions considered in passage of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of could result in future deficit spending for the medicare system  which could cause future payments under the medicare system to decline 
in addition  specified managed care programs  insurance companies  and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals 
the trend toward increased enrollment in managed care may adversely effect our net operating revenue growth 
results of operations our hospitals offer a variety of services involving a broad range of inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical services 
these include orthopedics  cardiology  occupational medicine  diagnostic services  emergency services  rehabilitation treatment  home health  and skilled nursing 
the strongest demand for hospital services generally occurs during january through april and the weakest demand for these services occurs during the summer months 
accordingly  eliminating the effect of new acquisitions  our net operating revenues and earnings are historically highest during the first quarter and lowest during the third quarter 
the following tables summarize  for the periods indicated  selected operating data 
years ended december  expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues net operating revenues operating expenses a depreciation and amortization amortization of goodwill minority interest in earnings income from operations interest expense  net loss from early extinguishment of debt income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  expressed in percentages percentage increase from prior year net operating revenues admissions adjusted admissions b average length of stay net income same store percentage increase decrease from prior year c net operating revenues admissions adjusted admissions b a operating expenses include salaries and benefits  provision for bad debts  supplies  rent  and other operating expenses 
b adjusted admissions is a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
we computed adjusted admissions by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues 
c includes acquired hospitals to the extent we operated them during comparable periods in both years 
year ended december  compared to december  net operating revenues increased by to billion in from billion in of the million increase in net operating revenues  the hospitals we acquired in and  which are not yet included in same store net operating revenues  contributed approximately million  and hospitals we owned throughout both periods contributed million  an increase of 
of the increase in net operating revenues from hospitals owned throughout both years  we estimate approximately was attributable to increases in rates and the acuity level of services provided  was attributable to volume increases and was attributable to increases in government reimbursement 
our ability to recruit physicians to fill the medical needs of the communities we serve and the addition of new services contributed to increased inpatient admissions and increased acuity of services provided 
inpatient admissions increased by due principally to newly acquired hospitals 
adjusted admissions increased by 
we computed adjusted admissions by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues 
on a same store basis  inpatient admissions increased by 
the growth in same store admissions in was lower than expected as a result of severe weather in a number of our markets  a loss of admissions from physicians called up for military service  selective service closures at certain hospitals and unusually high cobra utilization in following the increases in unemployment that did not repeat itself in in addition  we believe the economic conditions in led to lower than expected utilization of healthcare services 
an increase in flu and pneumonia related admissions in the fourth quarter of improved our admissions growth over the prior year offsetting a decrease in flu related admissions in the first quarter of same store adjusted admissions decreased by and patient days increased 
on a same store basis  net inpatient revenues increased and net outpatient revenues increased 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in salaries and benefits  as a percentage of net operating revenues  decreased from in to in  primarily as a result of improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods  offset by hospitals acquired in and  which have higher salaries and benefits as a percentage of net operating revenues  for which reductions have not yet been realized and the additional use of contract labor  primarily nursing 
provision for bad debts  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from in to in  as a result of an increase in uncollected self pay accounts  primarily caused by an increase in gross revenue 
supplies  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in  due mainly to the impact of the larger hospitals recently acquired  which have significantly higher supply expense as a percentage of net revenue  and the timing of converting these recently acquired hospitals to contracted vendors in our broadlane group purchasing arrangement  offset by improvements made to hospitals owned throughout both periods 
rent and other operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in this increase was caused primarily by an increase of of net operating revenue in contract labor expense and an increase in malpractice insurance expense of  offset by a decrease of for other operating expenses 
the increase in malpractice expense is primarily due to increases in self insured claims and increases in current year premium costs 
the increase in contract labor expense is primarily attributable to the costs of replacement workers as a result of the strike at easton hospital 
net income margins increased from in to in due to decreases in depreciation and interest as a percentage of net operating revenues  offset by the higher operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues at the hospitals acquired in and on a same store basis  we achieved a decrease in salary and benefits expense of of net operating revenue resulting from a combination of operating efficiency gains  offset by the additional use of contract labor  primarily nursing  to replace the striking workers at easton  of of net operating revenue 
the provision for bad debts expense increased of net operating revenues as a result of an increase in uncollected self pay accounts 
other operating expenses decreased of net operating revenue primarily as a result of an increase in malpractice expense of of net operating revenue  offset by a decrease in supplies expense of of net operating revenue and a decrease in other operating expense of of net operating revenue 
on a same store basis  income from operations as a percentage of net operating revenues increased from in to in  due mainly to a decrease in depreciation and amortization of of net operating revenue 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million  or of net operating revenues  in  from million  or of net operating revenues  in the hospitals acquired in and  prior to being included in same store results  accounted for million of the increase  while facility renovations and purchases of equipment  information systems upgrades  investments in physician recruiting and other deferred items accounted for the remaining million 
interest expense  net  increased by million from million in to million in as a result of a combination of increased borrowings and decreased average interest rates 
the increase in average debt balance in as compared to  due primarily to borrowings to make acquisitions in and  accounted for a million increase  offset by a decrease in interest rates during as compared to of million 
the decrease in average interest rates during is the result of the reduction in libor in early provision for income taxes increased million to million in from million in  as a result of the increase in pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate in is due primarily to a reduction in state taxes 
net income was million in compared to net income of million in  an increase of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenues increased by to billion in from billion in of the million increase in net operating revenues  the hospitals we acquired in and  prior to being included in same store revenues  contributed million and hospitals we owned throughout both periods contributed million or 
of this increase  approximately was attributable to volume increases and was attributable to increased rates and intensity of care from government programs  managed care and other payors 
inpatient admissions increased by 
adjusted admissions increased by 
average length of stay increased from days in to days at in on a same hospitals basis  inpatient admissions increased by and adjusted admissions increased by 
the increase in same hospitals inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions was due primarily to an increase in services offered  supported by physician relationship development efforts  and the addition of physicians through our focused recruitment program 
on a same hospitals basis  net inpatient revenues increased by and net outpatient operating revenues increased 
both inpatient and outpatient growth reflects increased volume as well as rate increases 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in  to in salaries and benefits  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in primarily as a result of the three hospitals acquired in the fourth quarter of and the six hospitals acquired in having higher salaries and benefits as a percentage of net operating revenues  than our existing hospitals  for which savings had not yet been fully realized  offset by improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
provision for bad debts  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased to in from in  primarily through better collections 
supplies  as a percentage of net operating revenues  remained unchanged in at reflecting an increase in supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues at recently acquired hospitals  offset by improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
rent and other operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in  primarily due to an increase in rent expense of of net operating revenue  an increase in the use of contract labor of of net operating revenue and the increased cost of malpractice insurance of of net operating revenue 
these fluctuations were largely the result of acquisitions of hospitals  which had lower margins than our existing hospitals 
on a same store basis  we achieved improvement through efficiency and productivity gains in payroll expense and reductions in supplies expense  offset by increases in contract labor and malpractice expense 
depreciation and amortization increased by million from million in to million in the eleven hospitals acquired in and  prior to being included in same store results  accounted for million of the increase  replacement hospital construction  hospital renovations  purchases of equipment  and information system upgrades accounted for million of the increase  and other deferred items  primarily the amortization of physician recruitment costs and purchased software  accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
amortization of goodwill decreased by million from million in to in this decrease is due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january  see critical accounting policies goodwill and other intangibles 
interest  net decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of a decrease in average interest rates of million and a savings of million due to a decrease in average outstanding borrowings 
identified activities leading to these results include interest savings of million from financings  including the october payoff of million of subordinated debt  concurrent with convertible debt and equity offerings  as well as the july bank debt refinancing  million from declining libor rates  and million  from the net effect of operating cash flows offset by capital expenditures 
interest expense increased by million as a result of the eleven hospitals acquired in and  and million in interest expense related to payments on interest rate swap contracts 
during the third quarter of  we refinanced our then existing billion credit agreement and repaid specified indebtedness 
in connection with repayment of that credit agreement  we recognized a loss of million on early extinguishment of debt as a result of writing off deferred financing costs associated with the refinanced credit agreement 
in this loss was reported as an extraordinary item 
to conform with the requirements of sfas no 
 we no longer classify this loss as an extraordinary item 
the provision for income taxes in was million compared to million in the decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in is primarily due to goodwill  for which the amortization of specified components was not deductible for tax purposes  and is no longer being amortized for financial reporting purposes in accordance with sfas no 
net income for was million as compared to million in liquidity and capital resources compared to net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  from million during to million during this decrease was due primarily to increases in accounts receivable from the acquisitions completed in  resulting in approximately million of negative cash flows during  where we did not purchase the seller s accounts receivable 
other factors negatively impacting cash flows were an increase in the number of days revenue outstanding  from days at december  to days at december   resulting in a decrease in cash flow of approximately million  an increase in cash paid for income taxes of million  a decrease in our liability to third party payors of million and the pre funding of our benefit trust for employee medical claims in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of factors positively impacting cash flows during as compared to were increases in net income of million  increases in depreciation and amortization expense of million  which is a non cash expense  increases in deferred tax expense of million and the net effect of changes in all other operating assets and liabilities  which resulted in a cash flow increase of million 
the use of cash in investing activities increased million from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash used for acquisitions of facilities of million during and an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of million during as compared to million of the increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment is attributable to the construction of replacement facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million from million in to million in in july   we completed a refinancing of our previous credit facility with a billion senior secured credit facility 
the facility consists of an million term loan that matures in and a million revolving credit facility that matures in in july  we amended our senior secured credit facility by exercising the feature allowing us to add million of funded term loans with the same interest rate per annum as the existing term loans 
the million in incremental term loans mature in we also have the ability to add up to million of securitized debt under our agreement  which we have not yet accessed and which represents additional borrowing capacity to fund future acquisitions 
as described more fully in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  at december   the company had certain cash obligations  which are due as follows in thousands total and thereafter long term debt      convertible notes   capital leases      total long term debt     operating leases replacement facilities   open purchase orders   total      in addition  we have also agreed  as part of the acquisition in petersburg  virginia  to build a replacement facility within five years subject to state certification of need approval 
since approval has not yet been obtained  final estimated construction costs are not yet available 
open purchase orders represent our commitment for items ordered but not yet received 
we do not have any long term purchase commitments under our national purchasing contracts 
as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at december   we had issued letters of credit primarily in support of specified outstanding bonds of approximately million 
in addition  at december   we had million in available borrowings from the revolving line of credit  of which million was set aside for outstanding letters of credit 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from million during to million during this increase was due primarily to an increase in net income of million  an increase in the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards of million to offset the amount of taxes paid  an increase in amounts owed to third party payors of million  an increase in our medical malpractice liability of million and improvements made in the management of working capital 
the use of cash in investing activities increased million from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of million during net cash provided by financing activities increased million from million in to million in in july   we completed a refinancing of our previous credit facility with a billion senior secured credit facility 
the facility consisted of an million term loan that matures in as opposed to under the previous facility and a million revolving credit facility that matures in as opposed to under the previous facility 
the facility had a feature that allowed for an additional million of future funded term loans  which we exercised in july capital expenditures cash expenditures for purchases of facilities was million in  million in and million in our capital expenditures in include million for the purchase of the ten hospitals acquired in and million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals in our capital expenditures in include million for the six hospitals acquired in  and million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the acquired hospitals in our capital expenditures in include million for the five hospitals acquired in  million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the acquired hospitals in and million for the purchases of other clinics and working capital at a managed facility in excluding the cost to construct replacement hospitals  our capital expenditures for totaled million compared to million in and million in costs to construct replacement hospitals totaled million in  million  including million of capital leases  in  and million  including million of capital leases  in the reduction of capital lease liabilities is included in financing activities in our statements of cash flows 
pursuant to hospital purchase agreements in effect as of december   we are required to construct one replacement hospital through to be located in las vegas  new mexico  with an estimated construction cost  including equipment  of approximately million 
of this amount  a cumulative total of approximately million has been expended through december  we have also agreed  as part of the acquisition in august of the southside regional medical center in petersburg  virginia  to build a replacement facility subject to state certificate of need approval 
since approval for this project has not yet been obtained  final construction cost estimates are not yet available 
we expect total capital expenditures of approximately to million in  including approximately to million for renovation and equipment purchases which includes amounts which are required to be expended pursuant to the terms of the hospital purchase agreements and approximately to million for construction and equipment cost of the current and recently completed replacement hospitals 
capital resources net working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the million decrease was attributable primarily to a decrease in cash balance that was used for acquisitions during  increases in accounts payable  employee compensation accruals and other accrued liabilities  offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to a combination of growth in same hospitals during  and the addition of ten hospitals in the aggregate net working capital of the ten hospitals acquired in  as of their respective dates of acquisition  was approximately million 
on july   we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility with a consortium of lenders 
the facility replaced our previous credit facility and consists of an million term loan that matures in as opposed to under the previous facility and a nine year million revolving credit facility that matures in as opposed to under the previous facility 
on july   we amended our senior secured credit facility by exercising a feature of the facility allowing the company to add million of funded term loans with the same interest rate per annum as the existing term loans 
the million in incremental term loans mature in we may elect from time to time an interest rate per annum for the borrowings under the term loan  including the incremental term loan  and revolving credit facility equal to a an annual benchmark rate  which will be equal to the greatest of i the prime rate  ii the base cd rate plus basis points or iii the federal funds effective rate plus basis points the abr  plus basis points for the term loan and the applicable margin for revolving credit loans or b the eurodollar rate plus basis points for the term loan and the eurodollar applicable margin for revolving credit loans 
we also pay a commitment fee for the daily average unused commitments under the revolving credit facility 
the commitment fee is based on a pricing grid depending on the eurodollar applicable margin for revolving credit loans and ranges from to 
the commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears and on the revolving credit termination date with respect to the available revolving credit commitments 
in addition  we will pay fees for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility 
the purpose of the facility was to refinance the company s previous credit agreement  repay specified other indebtedness  and fund general corporate purposes including acquisitions 
as of december   our availability for additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility was million of which million is set aside for outstanding letters of credit 
we also have the ability to add up to million of securitized debt under our agreement which we have not yet accessed 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate under our credit agreement was the terms of the credit agreement include various restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness  investments  asset sales  capital expenditures  sale and leasebacks  contingent obligations  transactions with affiliates  and fundamental changes 
we would be required to amend the existing credit agreement in order to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the covenants also require maintenance of various ratios regarding consolidated total indebtedness  consolidated interest  and fixed charges 
the level of these covenants are similar to or more favorable than the credit facility we refinanced 
we are currently a party to six separate interest swap agreements to limit the effect of changes in interest rates on a portion of our long term borrowings 
under two agreements  effective november  and expiring in november and  the company pays interest at fixed rates of and respectively 
each of these agreements have a million notional amount of indebtedness 
under a third agreement  effective november   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in november under a fourth agreement  effective june   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in june under a fifth agreement  effective june   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in june under a sixth agreement  effective october   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
this agreement expires in october we receive a variable rate of interest on each of these swaps based on the three month london inter bank offer libor  excluding the margin paid under the credit facility on a quarterly basis  which is currently basis points for revolver loans and basis points for term loans under the credit facility 
also  an agreement with million in notional amount of indebtedness expired on november  we believe that internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to finance acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements through the next months 
we believe these same sources of cash flows and borrowings under our credit agreement as well as access to bank credit and capital markets will be available to us beyond the next months and into the foreseeable future 
if funds required for future acquisitions exceed existing sources of capital  we believe that favorable terms could be obtained if we were to increase or refinance our credit facilities or obtain additional capital by other means 
off balance sheet arrangements included in our consolidated operating results for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively  of net operating revenue and million and million  respectively  of income from operations  generated from eight hospitals operated by us under operating lease arrangements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the respective assets and the future lease obligations under these arrangements are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
lease payments under these arrangements are included in rent expense when paid and totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the current terms of these operating leases expire between november and december  not including lease extensions that we have options to exercise 
the one hospital under lease whose current lease term is scheduled to expire in november generated million of net operating revenue and million of loss from operations for the year ended december  if we allow these leases to expire  we would no longer generate revenue nor incur expenses from these hospitals 
in the past  we have utilized operating leases as a financing tool for obtaining the operations of specified hospitals without acquiring  through ownership  the related assets of the hospital and without a significant outlay of cash at the front end of the lease 
we utilize the same operating strategies to improve operations under our ownership at those hospitals held under operating leases as we do at those hospitals that we own 
we have not entered into any operating leases for hospital operations since december joint ventures we have from time to time sold minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing minority interest ownership positions 
as of december   these included six hospitals  three surgery centers  three imaging centers and one clinic 
the amount of minority interest in equity is included in other long term liabilities and the minority interest in income or loss is recorded as an operating expense 
we do not believe these minority ownerships are material to our financial position or operating results 
as of and for the year ended december   the balance of minority interests included in long term liabilities was million and the amount of minority interest expense was million 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which will continue to limit payment increases under these programs and in some cases implement payment decreases 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments might  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could cause our future financial results to decline 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  our suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have generally offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services primarily from managed care companies and other third party payors  expanding services and reducing costs in other areas 
in addition we do not have significant long term contracts that would restrict our ability to increase revenue 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
third party reimbursement net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
contractual allowances are automatically calculated and recorded through our internally developed automated contractual allowance system 
within the automated system  actual medicare drg data  coupled with all payors historical paid claims data  is utilized to calculate the contractual allowances 
this data is automatically updated on a monthly basis and subjected to review by management to ensure reasonableness and accuracy 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings in the periods that such adjustments become known 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in future periods as final settlements are determined 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimates  actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are related to providing healthcare services to our hospitals patients 
collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and outstanding patient balances for which the primary insurance payor has paid and the remaining outstanding balance generally deductibles and co payments is owed by the patient 
at the point of service  for patients required to make a co payment  we generally collect less than of the related revenue 
for all procedures scheduled in advance  our policy is to verify insurance coverage prior to the date of the procedure 
insurance coverage is not verified in advance of procedures for walk in and emergency room patients 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by reserving as uncollectible all governmental and non governmental accounts over days from discharge 
this method is monitored based on our historical cash collections experience 
collections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
significant changes in payor mix  business office operations  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
the following table summarizes our days revenue outstanding as of the dates indicated as of december  days revenue outstanding our target for days revenue outstanding ranges from to days 
the primary reasons our current year days revenue outstanding increased from the prior year are the following testing of electronic billing edits under hipaa beginning october  slowed our billing process for specified claims  mutual of omaha  our sole medicare intermediary  went through a system conversion in july   and large acquisitions in the second half of required medicare billing approvals and new medicaid provider numbers delaying our billing at those hospitals 
the primary reasons our days revenue outstanding decreased from days in to days in are the following full implementation of our automated collection cycle during  consolidating from three fiscal intermediaries who process medicare payments to mutual of omaha as our sole medicare intermediary  and an improvement in our performance incentive plan as it relates to hospital business office managers 
uncollected accounts are automatically written off if the balance is under  when turned over to an outside collection agency  or over days from discharge if being collected by the company s internal collection agency 
at december   we have approximately million in accounts over days from discharge placed with our internal agency 
at december   we have approximately million being pursued by various outside collection agencies 
the following table is an aging of our gross prior to allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts accounts receivable in thousands 
balance as of december  days days days days medicare and medicaid     managed care  self pay and other    total gross accounts receivable    goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired

 goodwill arising from business combinations completed prior to july  was amortized on a straight line basis over a period ranging from to years 
currently  goodwill arising from business combinations whether or not completed prior to july  is accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
and is not amortized 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we selected september th as our annual testing date 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
we estimated the fair values of the related operations using both a debt free discounted cash flow model as well as an adjusted ebitda multiple model 
these models are both based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs  based primarily on historical performance and general market conditions  and are subject to review and approval by senior management and the board of directors 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital 
we performed our initial evaluation  as required by sfas no 
 during the first quarter of and the annual evaluation as of each succeeding september no impairment has been indicated by these evaluations 
estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue and profitability projections or fair values  could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
professional liability insurance claims we accrue for estimated losses resulting from professional liability claims to the extent they are not covered by insurance 
the accrual  which includes an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  is based on historical loss patterns and actuarially determined projections and is discounted to its net present value using a weighted average risk free discount rate of in and to the extent that subsequent claims information varies from management s estimates  the liability is adjusted currently 
our insurance is underwritten on a claims made basis 
prior to june   substantially all of our professional and general liability risks were subject to a million per occurrence deductible  for claims reported from june  through june   these deductibles were million per occurrence 
additional coverage above these deductibles was purchased through captive insurance companies in which we had a minority ownership interest in each and to which the premiums paid by us represented less than of the total premium revenues of each captive insurance company 
concurrently  with the formation of our own wholly owned captive insurance company in june  we terminated our minority interest relationships in those entities 
substantially all claims reported after june  are self insured up to million per claim 
management may on occasion increase the insured risk at certain hospitals based upon insurance pricing and other factors 
excess insurance for all hospitals is purchased through commercial insurance companies and generally covers us after the self insured amount up to million per occurrence 
income taxes we must make estimates in recording provision for income taxes  including determination of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize these benefits  subject to the valuation allowance we have established 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through fiscal year  which resulted in no material adjustments 
we make estimates we believe are accurate in order to determine that tax accruals are adequate to cover any potential audit adjustments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our credit agreement which bears interest based on floating rates 
in order to manage the volatility relating to the market risk  we entered into interest rate swap agreements described under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
we do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in we utilize risk management procedures and controls in executing derivative financial instrument transactions 
we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations are used with the goal of mitigating a portion of the exposure when it is cost effective to do so 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million for  million for  and million for
