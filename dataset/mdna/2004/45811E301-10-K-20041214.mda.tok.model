item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in the form k 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
general our electrical contracting business is operated in two segments commercial and industrial and residential 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of these reportable segments 
in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition  the assessment of goodwill impairment  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the recording of our self insurance liabilities and our estimation of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in the note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
we frequently negotiate the final terms and prices of those contracts with the customer 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on either a fixed price or unit price basis in which we agree to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price or for units of work performed unit price 
we also perform services on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
we are generally able to achieve higher margins on fixed price and unit price than on cost plus contracts 
we currently generate  and expect to continue to generate  more than half of our revenues under fixed price contracts 
our most significant cost drivers are the cost of labor  the cost of materials and the cost of casualty and health insurance 
these costs may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price and unit price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits or interim projected revenue and gross profits for a project differing from those we originally estimated and could result in losses on projects 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited in aggregate by the high volume and relatively short duration of the fixed price contracts we undertake 
additionally  we derive a significant amount of our revenues from new construction and from the southern part of the united states 
downturns in new construction activity in the southern part of the united states could negatively affect our results 
we complete most projects within one year 
we frequently provide service and maintenance work under open ended  unit price master service agreements which are renewable annually 
we recognize revenue on service and time and material work when services are performed 
work performed under a construction contract generally provides that the customers accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered measured in terms of units installed  hours expended or some other measure of progress 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion for construction contracts is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
we generally consider contracts to be substantially complete upon departure from the work site and acceptance by the customer 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated contract costs and profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and the effects of these revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined

index to financial statements we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
included in this evaluation are certain assumptions and estimates to determine the fair values of reporting units such as estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  as well as assumptions and estimates related to the valuation of other identified intangible assets 
changes in these assumptions and estimates or significant changes to the market value of our common stock could materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for unknown collection issues in addition to reserves for specific accounts receivable where collection is considered doubtful 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including  among others  our customers access to capital  our customers willingness to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationships with our customers 
we are insured for workers compensation  automobile liability  general liability  employment practices and employee related health care claims  subject to large deductibles 
our general liability program provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage that is neither expected nor intended 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the accruals are derived from actuarial studies  known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss 
we believe such accruals to be adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
therefore  if actual experience differs from than the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation  adjustments to the reserve may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
we regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
we perform this evaluation at least annually at the end of each fiscal year 
the estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets at september   we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  our results could be affected 
during the last three years we have been implementing a three phase strategy 
phase one  back to basics  emphasized basic business fundamentals of increasing backlog  controlling costs and generating positive cash flow 
phase two  one company 
one plan  focused on processes and systems necessary to integrate various decentralized business units 
phase three  continued growth  was designed to expand the businesses internally and via selective acquisitions 
since  when the strategy was developed and implemented we accomplished a number of our objectives while reducing debt and repurchasing shares of common stock 
during the summer of we announced that we would not timely issue our financial results for the third fiscal quarter 
since that time we have diligently worked to remedy the matters that gave rise to those events 
while we have determined that the matters were not widespread  the process and surrounding events caused us to modify our strategy to take a closer look at the overall operating and capital efficiency of our units to insure an optimal return on the capital invested in the company 
during october we began a process to strategically review the performance of each of our business units over the last three years 
we analyzed the financial performance of each unit with particular emphasis on 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the relative consistency of its results  returns on invested capital unit level working capital and fixed assets  the required invested capital at each unit including capital costs associated with surety bonding  construction spending and growth trends in each geographic market  management strength and other factors 
we determined that certain businesses did not meet our criteria and have decided to sell or close these units in order to improve overall profitability and capital efficiency of the company 
these units produced revenues and operating losses during of approximately million and million  respectively

the decline in gross margin during the year ended september  was primarily due to increased competition for available commercial and industrial work  the decline in gross profit margin at one subsidiary of million and increased costs associated with the procurement of copper wire  steel products and fuel 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase is due primarily to an million charge to settle a lawsuit taken during the fourth quarter ended september  this increase is also due to increased legal fees of million  increased bad debt expense of million due to receivable write offs and million in severance expenses recorded during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  these increased selling general and administrative expenses were offset by approximately million of reduced employment related expenses including employee paid medical insurance  bonuses and commissions and other variable expenses 
as a result of these charges  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  goodwill impairment charge during the year ended september   we recorded a charge of million related to impairments to the carrying value of goodwill 
this charge was entirely associated with the commercial and industrial segment of our operations

this increase was offset by a million decrease in interest expense during the year ended september  due to a lower amount of average debt outstanding during the year ended september  compared to the year ended september   and a shift to lower cost senior secured debt from subordinated debt during the year ended september provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended september  to negative for the year ended september  the decease is attributable to a pretax net loss  permanent differences required to be added back for income tax purposes  the impairment of non deductible goodwill  additional valuation allowance against certain federal and state deferred tax assets and a change in contingent tax liabilities 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets at september   we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible 
however  sfas  accounting for income taxes places considerably more weight on historical results and less weight on future projections when there is negative evidence such as cumulative pretax losses in recent years 
we incurred a cumulative pretax loss of for september   and including goodwill impairment of million in the year ended september  and excluding million resulting from the adoption of sfas in the year ended september  in the absence of specific favorable evidence of sufficient weight to offset the negative evidence of the cumulative pretax loss  we have provided million of valuation allowances for certain federal and state deferred tax assets

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenues decreased million  or  from  million for the year ended september  to  million for the year ended september  the decrease in total revenues is the result of million in lost revenues on divested or closed companies that were included in revenues for the year ended september   but not during the year ended september  these lost revenues were partially offset by million of revenues from an acquisition during the year ended september  the decline in commercial and industrial revenues is attributable to million decline in communications work due to market contractions  particularly in california  colorado  washington  dc and virginia 
the decrease in residential revenues is attributable to a million decline in multi family residential construction projects  primarily in colorado and maryland  offset by a million increase in single family construction spending 
we believe record low interest rates during the last months is driving demand for new homes  leading to record levels of single family residential construction spending 
as families move into their new single family homes  the demand for multi family housing has dropped 
gross margin segment gross margins as a percentage of segment revenues year ended september  commercial and industrial residential total company gross profit decreased million  or from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the decline in commercial and industrial gross profit was due to lower revenues earned year over year as discussed and due to a shift in the type of commercial and industrial work performed during the year ended september  the related service and maintenance work for commercial and industrial customers  which tends to earn higher gross margins than fixed price contracts  declined million in gross profit during the year 
this decline was moderated by a million increase in larger project work awarded during the year  particularly industrial contracts in excess of million 
these larger projects produce gross profits but tend to earn lower gross margins as a percentage of revenue due to the competitive bidding procedures in place to be awarded this type of work 
the shift of project work from small projects such as the service and maintenance work to larger projects in excess of million impacted gross profits by approximately million 
overall gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased approximately from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  had we earned the fiscal gross margin of  gross profit for the year ended september  would have been million  an increase of million 
the decline in gross margin during the year ended september  was due to the shift in type of commercial and industrial work performed and due to the increased competition for available residential work 
we believe low interest rates during the last months is driving demand for new homes  leading to record levels of single family residential construction spending 
this increased demand for residential construction has increased pricing pressure for available work  particularly affecting our operating units that perform limited amounts of residential work in addition to their commercial and industrial contract expertise 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this decline is due to the organizational restructuring that occurred during the year ended september  in the last months  we have combined administrative offices and functions  leading to a decline in operating locations from approximately locations to approximately locations 
we also divested or closed non performing

finally  we streamlined our administrative cost structure  yielding savings of million in salaries and benefits 
as a result of these changes  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  restructuring charges in october we began implementation of a workforce reduction program 
the purpose of this program was to cut costs by reducing the number of administrative staff both in the field and at the home office 
the total number of terminated employees was approximately as a result of the program implementation  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million associated with employees during the year ended september  and presented these charges as a separate component of our results of operations for the period then ended 
no restructuring charges were incurred for the year ended september  the charges were based on the costs of the workforce reduction program and include severance and other special termination benefits 
we believe the reduction of these personnel resulted in annual savings of approximately million in salaries and benefits 
at september   approximately million of these charges that related to five individuals had not been paid and were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
at september   approximately million of these charges that relate to three individuals have not been paid and are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the remaining payments accrued under this restructuring were made during the year ended september  income from operations income from operations increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  as a percentage of revenues  income from operations increased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  this increase in income from operations was primarily attributed to million in restructuring charges recorded during the year ended september   and a million decrease selling  general and administrative expenses year over year  offset by a million decline in gross profits earned during the year ended september  interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest expense during the year ended september  due to a lower amount of average debt outstanding during the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  during the year ended september   other expense  net included a million gain from the sale of certain subsidiaries and a million loss recorded on our investment in energy photovoltaics  inc this was a decrease from other expense  net  for the year ended september   which included a million gain resulting from the retirement of million of our senior subordinated notes due february  in the last quarter of the year ended september   a million net gain resulting from the sale of certain subsidiaries and offset by a million loss recorded on our investment in energy photovoltaics  inc and losses on sales of assets of million 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to the release of million of tax valuation allowances that were included in income during the year ended september  we released these valuation allowances because we believe that we will now realize a portion of the deferred tax assets for which they were established 
without the impact of these valuation allowance releases  our effective tax rate was for the year ended september

goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value was determined using discounted cash flows  market multiples and market capitalization 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at adoption of sfas no 
and at least annually thereafter 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples for each of the reportable units 
on an ongoing basis absent any impairment indicators  we expect to perform our impairment tests annually during the first fiscal quarter 
based on our impairment tests performed upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recognized a charge of million per share in the first quarter of to reduce the carrying value of goodwill of our reporting units to its implied fair value 
this impairment is a result of adopting a fair value approach  under sfas no 
 to testing impairment of goodwill as compared to the previous method utilized in which evaluations of goodwill impairment were made using the estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to the assets carrying amount 
the impairment was the result of lower forecasted future operating income at the point of adoption than we anticipated to result from decreased spending in the construction industry in all of our markets 
the impairment related to our operating regions follows amounts in millions southeast northeast gulf plains central west residential divested after adoption total under sfas no 
 the impairment adjustment recognized at adoption of the new rules was reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the statement of operations for the year ended september  impairment adjustments recognized after adoption  if any  generally are required to be recognized as operating expenses

index to financial statements on august   we announced that we would not timely file our results for the three months ended june  on form q 
we also announced that there was also a possibility that factors surrounding certain material weaknesses in internal control may require a restatement of prior periods 
following this announcement  our stock price declined percent to on august  we believe that this decline in stock price plus the jury verdict and uncertainties surrounding our ability to obtain surety bonds was reflective of a change in our operations that indicated that a possible impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill existed at september  therefore  we performed a test for impairment and consequently recorded a charge of million 
this charge is included in arriving at income loss from operations for the year ended september  the impairment detailed by our operating regions follows amounts in millions southeast northeast gulf plains central west total on february  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of riviera electric llc riviera out of a bankruptcy auction of a prior competitor 
riviera provides electrical contracting services in the state of colorado

the cash used to purchase this acquisition was funded by operations 
in december  we made an investment in energy photovoltaics  inc epv  based in lawrenceville  new jersey 
epv is a privately held developer and provider of proprietary thin film processes and equipment for manufacturing photovoltaic modules to provide solar energy 
we account for our percent interest in epv in accordance with the equity method of accounting and accordingly recorded our share of epv s losses of million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
at september   we had a carrying value of our investment in epv million and a million debt investment in epv 
we performed a discounted cash flow analysis at september  and determined that no impairment to this investment existed 
this investment involves certain risks involving demand for photovoltaic services 
if epv is unable to deliver on its business plan  we could deem this investment impaired and would record a charge to other expense in the period such impairment  if any  is determined 
all of our operating income and cash flows are generated by our owned subsidiaries  which are the subsidiary guarantors of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes 
we are structured as a holding company and substantially all of our assets and operations are held by our subsidiaries 
there are currently no significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan 
the parent holding company s independent assets  revenues  income before taxes and operating cash flows are less than of the consolidated total

as a result  the presentation of separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the subsidiary guarantors is not deemed material 
off balance sheet arrangements as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements that expose us to increased risk 
our significant off balance sheet transactions include commitments associated with noncancelable operating leases  letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees

index to financial statements we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to retain our cash when we do not own the vehicles or equipment and we pay a monthly lease rental fee 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
we may determine to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term 
typically we are liable to the lessor for various lease cancellation or termination costs and the difference between the then fair market value of the leased asset and the implied book value of the leased asset as calculated in accordance with the lease agreement 
some of our customers require us to post letters of credit as a means of guaranteeing performance under our contracts and ensuring payment by us to subcontractors and vendors 
if our customer has reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit  we would be required to reimburse our creditor for the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances surrounding a reimbursement to our creditor  we may have a charge to earnings in that period

at september   million of our outstanding letters of credit were to collateralize our customers 
some of the underwriters of our casualty insurance program require us to post letters of credit as collateral 
this is common in the insurance industry 
to date we have not had a situation where an underwriter has had reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit 
at september   million of our outstanding letters of credit were to collateralize our insurance program 
many of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a surety 
those bonds guarantee the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
in the event that we fail to perform under a contract or pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand the surety to pay or perform under our bond 
our relationship with our sureties is such that we will indemnify the sureties for any expenses they incur in connection with any of the bonds they issues on our behalf 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs to indemnify our sureties for expenses they incurred on our behalf 
as of september   our cost to complete projects covered by surety bonds was approximately million and we utilized a combination of cash and letters of credit totaling million to collateralize our bonding program 
other commitments in april  we committed to invest up to million in enertech capital partners ii lp enertech 
enertech is a private equity firm specializing in investment opportunities emerging from the deregulation and resulting convergence of the energy  utility and telecommunications industries 
through september   we had invested million under our commitment to enertech 
the carrying value of this enertech investment at september  and was million and million  respectively 
this investment is accounted for on the cost basis of accounting and accordingly  we do not record unrealized losses for the enertech investment that it believes are temporary in nature 
as of september   the unrealized losses related to the company s share of the enertech fund amounted to approximately million  which we believe are temporary in nature 
if facts arise that lead us to determine that such unrealized losses are not temporary  we would write down our investment in enertech through a charge to other expense during the period of such determination 
our future contractual obligations include in thousands thereafter total debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations the tabular amounts exclude the interest obligations that will be created if the debt and capital lease obligations are outstanding for the periods presented

outlook economic conditions across the country are challenging although construction industry spending is expected to increase by two percent in according to fw dodge 
we continue to focus on collecting receivables and reducing days sales outstanding 
we will continue to take steps to reduce our costs 
we have made significant reductions in administrative overhead at the home office and in the field 
we have elected to sell or close certain operations that are heavily dependent on bonding or are otherwise underperforming 
these operations generated total revenues in fiscal of million and operating losses of million 
if we are successful in our efforts to sell these operations  their revenue and income loss contributions will no longer be included in our results of operations and the sales proceeds will be used primarily to reduce our indebtedness 
as we continue to divest of operations and cut costs our outlook will change 
therefore  we are not providing guidance at this time 
we expect to generate cash flow from operations  sales of businesses  borrowing under our convertible debt indenture and our credit facility 
our cash flows from operations tend to track with the seasonality of our business and historically have improved in the latter part of our fiscal year 
we anticipate that these combined cash flows will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and capital expenditures for property and equipment through the next twelve months 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  our ability to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors  including demand for our products and services  the availability of projects at margins acceptable to us  the ultimate collectibility of our receivables  the ability to consummate transactions to dispose of businesses and our ability to borrow on our credit facility 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
seasonality and cyclical fluctuations our results of operations from residential construction are seasonal  depending on weather trends  with typically higher revenues generated during spring and summer and lower revenues during fall and winter 
the commercial and industrial aspect of our business is less subject to seasonal trends  as this work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather 
our service and maintenance business is generally not affected by seasonality 
in addition  the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical 
our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions 
quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects  acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period 
inflation due to the relatively low levels of inflation experienced in fiscal and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results in those fiscal years or on any of the acquired businesses during similar periods 
during fiscal  however  we experienced significant increases in the commodity prices of copper products  steel products and fuel 
over the long term  we expect to be able to pass these increased costs to our customers
