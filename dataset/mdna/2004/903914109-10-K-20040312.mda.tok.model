important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are included throughout this document 
the cautionary statements expressly qualify all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on the company s behalf 
competition 
the company competes with numerous other companies in virtually all facets of its business 
the competitors in development  exploration  acquisitions and production include major integrated oil and gas companies as well as numerous independents  including many that have significantly greater resources 
therefore  competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than the financial or personnel resources of the company permit 
the ability of the company to increase reserves in the future will be dependent on its ability to select and acquire suitable prospects for future exploration and development 
the availability of a market for oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond the control of the company  including  but not limited to  the availability of other domestic or imported production  the locations and capacity of pipelines  and the effect of federal and state regulations on production 
historically  the company s projects have been financed through debt and internally generated cash flow 
there is competition for capital to finance oil and gas drilling 
the ability of the company to obtain such 
table of contents financing is uncertain and can be affected by numerous factors beyond its control 
the inability of the company to raise capital in the future could have an adverse effect on certain areas of its business 
marketing of oil and natural gas 
the ability to market oil and natural gas depends on numerous factors beyond the company s control 
these factors include the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas  the availability of pipeline capacity  the effects of inclement weather  the demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users  the availability of alternative fuel sources  the proximity of natural gas production to natural gas pipelines  state and federal regulations of oil and natural gas marketing  and federal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce 
because of these factors  the company may be unable to market all of the oil and natural gas that it produces  including oil and natural gas that may be produced from the bohai bay properties 
in addition  the company may be unable to obtain favorable prices for the oil and natural gas it produces 
volatility of oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company s control 
these factors include but are not limited to weather conditions in the united states  the condition of the united states economy  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  governmental regulation  political stability in the middle east and elsewhere  the foreign supply of oil and gas  the price of foreign oil and gas imports and the availability of alternate fuel sources and transportation interruption 
any substantial and extended decline in the price of oil or gas could have an adverse effect on the carrying value of the company s proved reserves  borrowing capacity  the company s ability to obtain additional capital  and the company s revenues  profitability and cash flows from operations 
volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and divestiture and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects 
price of wyoming production 
the company produces natural gas in wyoming 
the market price for this natural gas differs from the market indices for natural gas in the gulf coast region of the united states due potentially to insufficient pipeline capacity and or low demand in the summer months for natural gas in the rocky mountain region of the united states 
therefore  the effect of a price decrease may more adversely affect the price received for the company s wyoming production than production in the other us regions 
government regulations 
the company s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require that the company acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells  and require governmental approval of the overall development plan prior to the start of development of fields in china 
under these laws and regulations  the company could be liable for personal injury and clean up costs and other environmental and property damages  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
the company maintains limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages  but does not maintain insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden and accidental environmental damages 
accordingly  the company may be subject to liability or may be required to cease production from properties in the event of environmental damages 

table of contents a significant percentage of the company s united states operations are conducted on federal lands 
these operations are subject to a variety of on site security regulations as well as other permits and authorizations issued by the blm  the wyoming department of environmental quality and other agencies 
a portion of the company s acreage is affected by winter lease stipulations that prohibit exploration  drilling and completing activities generally from november to april  but allow production activities all year round 
to drill wells in wyoming  the company is required to file an application for permit to drill with the wyoming oil and gas conservation commission 
drilling on acreage controlled by the federal government requires the filing of a similar application with the blm 
these permitting requirements may adversely affect the company s ability to complete its drilling program at the cost and in the time period currently anticipated 
on large scale projects  lessees may be required to perform environmental impact statements to assess the environmental impact of potential development  which can delay project implementation and or result in the imposition of the environmental restrictions that could have a material impact on cost or scope 
limited financial resources 
the company s ability to continue exploration and development of its properties and to replace reserves may be dependent upon its ability to continue to raise significant additional financing  including debt financing that may be significant  or obtain some other arrangements with industry partners in lieu of raising financing 
any arrangements that may be entered into could be expensive to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital in light of factors such as the market demand for its securities  the state of financial markets for independent oil companies including the markets for debt  oil and gas prices and general market conditions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the company s capital budget 
the company expects to continue using its bank credit facility to borrow funds to supplement its available cash flow 
the amount the company may borrow under the credit facility may not exceed a borrowing base determined by the lenders based on their projections of the company s future production  future production costs and taxes  commodity prices and other factors 
the company cannot control the assumptions the lenders use to calculate the borrowing base 
the lenders may  without the company s consent  adjust the borrowing base at any time 
if the company s borrowings under the credit facility exceed the borrowing base  the lenders may require that the company repay the excess 
if this were to occur  the company may have to sell assets or seek financing from other sources 
the company can make no assurances that it would be successful in selling assets or arranging substitute financing 
for a description of the bank credit facility and its principal terms and conditions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
interruptions from severe weather 
the company s operations are conducted principally in the rocky mountain region 
the weather in this area can be extreme and can cause interruption in the company s exploration and production operations 
moreover  especially severe weather can result in damage to facilities entailing longer operational interruptions and significant capital investment 
likewise  the company s rocky mountain operations are subject to disruption from winter storms and severe cold  which can limit operations involving fluids and impair access to the company s facilities 
a portion of the company s acreage is affected by winter lease stipulations that restrict the period of time during which operations may be conducted on the leases 
the company s leases that are affected by the winter stipulations prohibit drilling and completing activities from mid november to mid may  but allow production activities all year round 
the company invests heavily in exploration 
the company has historically invested a significant portion of its capital budget in drilling exploratory wells in search of unproved oil and gas reserves 
the company cannot be certain that the exploratory wells it drills will be productive or that it will recover all or any portion of its investments 
in order to increase the chances for exploratory success  the company often invests in seismic or other geoscience data to assist it in identifying potential drilling objectives 
additionally  the cost of drilling  completing and testing exploratory wells is often uncertain at the time of the company s initial investment 
depending on complications encountered while drilling  the final cost of the well may significantly exceed that which the company originally estimated 
the company capitalizes all direct costs of drilling an unsuccessful exploratory well in the period in which the well is determined not to be producible in commercial quantities 
under the full cost method of accounting these costs are then depleted using the units of production method based on the company s proven reserves 
replacement of reserves 
the company s future success may depend on its ability to find  develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
without successful exploration  development or acquisition activities  the company s reserves and production will decline 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs 

table of contents operating hazards and uninsured risks 
the oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks  including fire  explosion  pipe failure  casing collapse  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  gas leaks  and discharges of toxic gases 
the occurrence of any of these events with respect to any property operated or owned in whole or in part by the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company and the operators of its properties maintain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be reasonable 
however  insurance coverage is not always economically feasible and is not obtained to cover all types of operational risks 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
drilling and operating risks 
the company s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with drilling for  and production and transportation of  oil and gas 
these risks include the necessity of spending large amounts of money for identification and acquisition of properties and for drilling and completion of wells 
in the drilling of exploratory or development wells  failures and losses may occur before any deposits of oil or gas are found 
the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  blow outs or accidents may cause such activity to be unsuccessful  resulting in a loss of the company s investment in such activity 
if oil or gas is encountered  there can be no assurance that it can be produced in quantities sufficient to justify the cost of continuing such operations or that it can be marketed satisfactorily 
drilling plans subject to change 
this report includes certain descriptions of the company s future drilling plans with respect to its prospects 
a prospect is an area which the company s geoscientists have identified what they believe  based on available seismic and geological information  to be indications of hydrocarbons 
the company s prospects are in various stages of review 
whether or not the company ultimately drills a prospect may depend on the following factors receipt of additional seismic data or reprocessing of existing data  material changes in oil or gas prices  the costs and availability of drilling equipment  success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same production facilities  availability and cost of capital  changes in the estimates of costs to drill or complete wells  the approval of partners to participate in the drilling or  in the case of cnooc  approval of expenditures for budget purposes  the company s ability to attract other industry partners to acquire a portion of the working interest to reduce exposure to costs and drilling risks  decisions of the company s joint working interest owners  and the blm s interpretation of the eis and the results of the permitting process 
the company will continue to gather data about its prospects  and it is possible that additional information may cause the company to alter its drilling schedule or determine that a prospect should not be pursued at all 
financial reporting impact of full cost method of accounting 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
a separate cost center is maintained for expenditures applicable to each country in which the company conducts exploration and or production activities 
under such method  the net book value of properties on a country by country basis  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed a calculated ceiling 
the ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties  discounted at per year 
in calculating discounted future net revenues  oil and gas prices in effect at the time of the calculation are held constant  except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts 
the net book value is compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis 
the excess  if any  of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense 
under sec full cost accounting rules  any write off recorded may not be reversed even if higher oil and gas prices increase the ceiling applicable to future periods 
future price decreases could result in reductions in the carrying value of such assets and an equivalent charge to earnings 
risks arising from being non operator in bohai bay 
because the company is not the operator and holds a minority interest it cannot control the pace of exploration or development in the bohai bay properties or major decisions affecting drilling of wells or the plan for development and production  although contract provisions give the company certain consent rights in some matters 
kerr mcgee s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which the company spends money on this project 
if kerr mcgee were to shift its focus from this project  the pace of development of the blocks could slow down or stop altogether 
the company currently does not believe it has sufficient funds to purchase kerr mcgee s interests in these blocks if they were offered 
on the other hand  if kerr mcgee were to decide to accelerate development of this project  the company could be required to fund its share of costs at a faster pace than anticipated  which might exceed its ability to raise funds 
if  because of this  the company were unable to pay its share of costs  it could lose or be forced to sell its interest in the bohai bay properties or be forced to not participate in the exploration or 
table of contents development of specific prospects or fields on the blocks  potentially diminishing the value of its bohai bay assets 
political  economic or international factors affecting china 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrections  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  change in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  labor problems  other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over its international operations  and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 
tensions between china and its neighbors or various western countries  regional political or military disruption  changes in internal chinese leadership  social or political disruptions within china  a downturn in the chinese economy  or a change in chinese laws or attitudes toward foreign investment could make china an unfavorable environment in which to invest 
although all the foreign interest owners in the bohai bay properties have the right to sell production in the world market  the regulation of the concession by china  and the likely participation by cnooc as a large working interest owner  make chinese internal and external affairs important to the investment in the bohai bay 
if any of these negative events were to occur  it could lead to a decision that there is an intolerable level of risk in continuing with the investment  or the company may be unable to attract equity investors or lenders  or satisfy any then existing lenders 
in the event of a dispute arising from foreign operations  the company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states or a potentially more favorable country 
in addition  the company s china pscs terminate after years of production  unless extended as provided for  which may be prior to the end of the productive life of the fields 
operating risks in china 
offshore operations  such as the company s bohai bay properties  are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and or loss from storms or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  the company could incur substantial liabilities that could result in financial losses or failures 
china has many regulations similar to those addressed in item i  environmental regulation  that may expose the company to liability 
offshore projects  like the china field developments  are typically large  complex construction projects that are potentially subject to delays which may cause delays in achieving production and profitability

table of contents terms used to describe the company s interests in wells and acreage gross oil and gas wells or acres the company s gross wells or gross acres represent the total number of wells or acres in which the company owns a working interest 
net oil and gas wells or acres determined by multiplying gross oil and natural gas wells or acres by the working interest that the company owns in such wells or acres represented by the underlying properties 
terms used to assign a present value to the company s reserves standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  after income taxes the present value  discounted at  of the pre tax future net cash flows attributable to estimated net proved reserves 
the company calculates this amount by assuming that it will sell the oil and gas production attributable to the proved reserves estimated in its independent engineer s reserve report for the prices it received for the production on the date of the report  unless it had a contract to sell the production for a different price 
the company also assumes that the cost to produce the reserves will remain constant at the costs prevailing on the date of the report 
the assumed costs are subtracted from the assumed revenues resulting in a stream of future net cash flows 
estimated future income taxes using rates in effect on the date of the report are deducted from the net cash flow stream 
the after tax cash flows are discounted at to result in the standardized measure of the company s proved reserves 
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows the discounted present value of proved reserves is identical to the standardized measure  except that estimated future income taxes are not deducted in calculating future net cash flows 
the company discloses the discounted present value without deducting estimated income taxes to provide what it believes is a better basis for comparison of its reserves to the producers who may have different tax rates 
terms used to classify the company s reserve quantities the sec definition of proved oil and gas reserves  per article a of regulation s x  is as follows proved oil and gas reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
a reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled  but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
b reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project  or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
c estimates of proved reserves do not include the following oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves  crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors  crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects  and crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite and other such sources 
proved developed reserves proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 

table of contents proved undeveloped reserves proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required 
terms used to describe the legal ownership of the company s oil and gas properties working interest a real property interest entitling the owner to receive a specified percentage of the proceeds of the sale of oil and natural gas production or a percentage of the production  but requiring the owner of the working interest to bear the cost to explore for  develop and produce such oil and natural gas 
a working interest owner who owns a portion of the working interest may participate either as operator or by voting his percentage interest to approve or disapprove the appointment of an operator and drilling and other major activities in connection with the development and operation of a property 
terms used to describe seismic operations seismic data oil and gas companies use seismic data as their principal source of information to locate oil and gas deposits  both to aid in exploration for new deposits and to manage or enhance production from known reservoirs 
to gather seismic data  an energy source is used to send sound waves into the subsurface strata 
these waves are reflected back to the surface by underground formations  where they are detected by geophones which digitize and record the reflected waves 
computers are then used to process the raw data to develop an image of underground formations 
d seismic data d seismic survey data has been the standard acquisition technique used to image geologic formations over a broad area 
d seismic data is collected by a single line of energy sources which reflect seismic waves to a single line of geophones 
when processed  d seismic data produces an image of a single vertical plane of sub surface data 
d seismic data d seismic data is collected using a grid of energy sources  which are generally spread over several miles 
a d survey produces a three dimensional image of the subsurface geology by collecting seismic data along parallel lines and creating a cube of information that can be divided into various planes  thus improving visualization 
consequently  d seismic data is a more reliable indicator of potential oil and natural gas reservoirs in the area evaluated
