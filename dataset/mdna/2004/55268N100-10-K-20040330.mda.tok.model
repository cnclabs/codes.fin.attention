strategic alternatives the company has retained bear  stearns co 
inc as financial advisor to the board of directors 
the board is evaluating potential business combinations  financing and other strategic alternatives to help the company offer enhanced products and services to its customers and maximize shareholder value 
the company continues to conduct the strategic review process 
the process is ongoing  and to date the company has not entered any transaction as a result of the strategic review 
restructuring the company believes that economic conditions and trends have adversely affected and may continue to affect levels of capital spending by companies in a variety of industries  including companies in the vertical markets that the company serves 
the current excess supply of capacity in the telecommunications industry has adversely affected the financial condition of many telecommunications companies worldwide 
in addition  economic conditions and developments in the energy markets have had an adverse effect on the financial condition of energy and utility companies in certain geographic areas of north america 
the company believes that these and other factors have adversely affected demand for products and services offered by the company  as certain prospective and existing customers have delayed or deferred purchasing decisions  have elected not to purchase the company s products  or have sought to terminate existing contracts for the company s products and services 
as a result  the company s results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate from period to period depending on a number of facts  particularly the timing and receipt of significant orders 
while the company believes that economic conditions in certain of its vertical markets show signs of improvement  the company believes that economic and political conditions are likely to continue to affect demand for the company s products and services in  particularly demand for software and related services 
see forward looking statements 
such factors may also increase the amount of doubtful accounts or adversely affect the likelihood of collection of such accounts 
in order to address the uncertainties caused by these economic trends  mdsi announced in its intention to reduce its operating expenses through workforce reductions and other measures 
these measures have been gradually implemented with incremental reductions in costs each quarter  and were expected to result in an estimated million in cost reductions per quarter by the end of a majority of the savings were realized by reduced salary and payroll costs  and the remaining savings have been realized from the subleasing of excess space  and a reduction in discretionary spending 
as a result of the sale of the public safety operations during the second quarter of  the company exceeded the estimated quarterly savings 
there can be no assurance that the workforce reductions and other measures will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business operations 
in connection with this restructuring  on march   mdsi terminated employee and contractor positions in canada and the united states 
on may   the company continued the restructuring by announcing the elimination of an additional positions  which in combination with the workforce reductions of march  amounted to approximately of mdsi s staff as of march  the company recorded a one time charge of million in the first quarter of relating to the workforce reductions  and leasing of excess office space 
the company also recorded an additional charge of approximately million in the second quarter of relating to elimination of positions  leasing of excess office space  and fixed asset write downs announced on may  a breakdown of the nature of the charges and the costs incurred to date is as follows total restructuring charge workforce reduction  provision for excess office space  non cash write down of capital assets  other  total restructuring charges  cumulative draw downs  accrued restructuring charges as at december   during the year ended december   the company made cash payments of  relating to the restructuring accruals 
provisions relating to workforce reductions  write down of capital assets  and other items have been fully drawn down  and no further expenditures relating to these items are expected to be incurred 
the company has recorded a million provision relating to surplus office space under long term lease by the company at two locations  including one location where the company has entered into fixed cost lease arrangements expiring in the company has incurred approximately million of cash costs relating to this provision leaving an accrual of million remaining as at december  the company expects that the provision will be fully drawn down no later than the time the lease expires in the fourth quarter of field service business the implementation of a complete mobile data solution requires a wireless data communications network  mobile computing devices integrated with wireless data communication modems  host computer equipment  industry specific application software such as mdsi s advantex products  wireless connectivity software and a variety of services to manage and install these components  integrate them with an organization s existing computer systems and configure or customize the software to meet customer requirements 
frequently  in the company s larger contracts only a limited number of the users are rolled out initially  with the balance implemented over a period that may extend up to one year or more 
where increases in mobile workforces require or where additional departments of mobile workers are added  additional mobile computing devices may be installed  which may result in additional revenue for the company 
see forward looking statements 
revenue for software and services has historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenue 
typically  the company enters into a fixed price contract with a customer for the licensing of selected software products and the provision of specific services  which includes a warranty period that is generally ninety days in length 
these services are generally performed within six to twelve months 
pricing for these contracts includes license fees as well as a fee for professional services 
the company generally recognizes total revenue for software and services associated with a contract using a percentage of completion method based on the total man days incurred over the total estimated man days to complete the contract 
the company s customers typically enter into ongoing maintenance agreements that provide for maintenance and technical support services for a period commencing after expiration of the initial warranty period 
maintenance agreements typically have a term of one to three years and are invoiced either annually  quarterly  or monthly 
revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
the company is periodically required to provide  in addition to mdsi products and services  certain third party products  such as host computer hardware and operating system software  and mobile computing devices 
the company recognizes revenue on the supply of third party hardware and software upon transfer of title to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue on the supply of third party services using a percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred over the total estimated cost to complete the third party services contract 
also included in third party revenue are reimbursements to the company for out of pocket expenses incurred on implementation projects performed by the company 
eitf income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses requires characterization of these expenses as revenue 
an equal and offsetting amount of expense is recognized relating to these reimbursements as direct costs 
the company believes that it will periodically supply third party products and services to customers where it is successful in selling its own products and services 
there can be no assurance  however  that any contracts entered into by the company to supply third party software and products in the future will represent a substantial portion of revenue in any future period 
since the revenue generated from the supply of third party products and services may represent a significant portion of certain contracts and the installation and rollout of third party products is generally at the discretion of the customer  the company may  depending on the level of third party products and services provided during a period  experience large fluctuations in revenue 
during  mdsi decided not to continue pursuing opportunities in the public safety market 
these opportunities consisted of federal  state and local agencies that provide police  fire  medical and other emergency services 
the company had installed solutions for a limited number of customers  and this market did not represent a material portion of mdsi s revenues 
on may  the company entered into an agreement with datamaxx applied technologies inc datamaxx  granting exclusive license to datamaxx for mdsi s public safety products in north america  and non exclusive license rights for these products outside north america 
the company also assigned its existing contracts in the public safety market to datamaxx 
mdsi will receive royalty payments under the agreement for any license and implementation revenue earned by datamaxx in relation to the licensed products  subject to a maximum royalty payout of  as a result of this licensing agreement  the company has now exited the public safety market 
the company s revenue is dependent  in large part  on significant contracts from a limited number of customers 
as a result  any substantial delay in the company s completion of a contract  the inability of the company to obtain new contracts or the cancellation of an existing contract by a customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
some of the company s contracts are cancelable upon notice by the customer 
the loss of certain contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from period to period

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the significant accounting policies are outlined within note to the consolidated financial statements 
some of those accounting policies require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by the company 
the following items require the most significant judgment and involve complex estimation restructuring charges in calculating the cost to dispose of excess facilities the company was required to estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  and the amount  if any  of sublease revenues 
this required estimating the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which the company might be able to sublease the site 
from the estimates for these costs the company performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
a charge of million was recorded for the restructuring of excess facilities as part of the restructuring plan 
the company s assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  or the offsetting sublease revenues may be proven incorrect and actual cost may be materially different from the estimates 
accounts receivable the company periodically reviews the collectability of its accounts receivable balances 
where significant doubt exists with regards to the collection of a certain receivable balance  an allowance and charge to the income statement is recorded 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million

if future events indicate additional collection issues  the company may be required to record an additional allowance for doubtful accounts 
during the year ended december  the company wrote off a long term receivable of million  as the company entered into a settlement agreement with this customer whereby no further proceeds on the receivable would be realized by the company 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 
 revenue recognition  and other authoritative accounting literature 
we derive revenues from the following sources license fees  professional services  maintenance and support fees and third party products and services 
we generally provide services with our supply agreements  that include significant production  modification  and customisation of the software 
these services are not separable and are essential to the functionality of the software  and as a result we account for these licence and service arrangements under sop using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
license fees and professional services our supply agreements generally include multiple products and services  or elements 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a supply agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on the historical evidence of stand alone sales  or renewal terms of these elements to customers 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee  which relates to the license and implementation services  is recognized as revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the total revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value is established 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts with fixed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
when the total cost estimate for a project exceeds revenue  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
we are engaged on a continuous basis in the production and delivery of software under contractual agreements 
as a result we have developed a history of being able to estimate costs to complete and the extent of progress toward completion of contracts  which supports the use of the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
professional services revenue primarily consists of consulting and customer training revenues  which are usually charged on a time and materials basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from certain fixed price contracts is recognized on a proportional performance basis  which involves the use of estimates related to total expected man days of completing the contract derived from historical experience with similar contracts 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
maintenance revenue generally  maintenance is initially sold as an element of a master supply arrangement  with subsequent annual renewals  and is priced as a percentage of new software license fees 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which typically is one year 
maintenance and support revenue includes software license updates that provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
product support services also include internet and telephone access to technical support personnel 
historically  we have provided a warranty phase during the supply agreement 
services provided during this warranty phase include elements of maintenance and support 
as a result we  defer a portion of the supply agreement fee  based on vendor specific objective evidence of the value of these services  and recognize the deferred amount as revenue over the warranty period 
third party products and services revenue from sales of third party products and services is recognized on delivery of the products 
services are recognized on a percentage complete basis 
when software licenses are sold incorporating third party products or sold with third party products  we recognize as revenue the gross amount of sales of third party product 
the recognition of gross revenue is in accordance with criteria established in emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
on occasion  we utilize third party consultants to assist in implementations or installations originated by the company 
in these cases  in accordance with criteria established in eitf as described above  the revenue for these implementations and installations is typically recognized on a gross basis 
in these cases we ultimately manage the engagement 
income taxes the company has incurred losses and other costs that can be applied against future taxable earnings to reduce the tax liability on those earnings 
as the company is uncertain of realizing the future benefit of those losses and expenditures  the company has recorded a valuation allowance against most non capital loss carry forwards  and other deferred tax assets arising from differences in tax and accounting bases 
actual results may be materially different from the current estimate 
intangible assets as part of the company s restructuring plan  during the year ended december  the company determined that an impairment in the value of goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of alliance systems  inc had occurred 
a valuation allowance was recorded of million  equal to the remaining net book value 
the company also discontinued development of its e service manager product line during the year 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded to remove the remaining net book value 
investments and advances during the year ended december  mdsi invested in or advanced funds to private companies  which the company reviews periodically to determine if there has been a non temporary decline in the market value of those investments and advances below the carrying value 
the assessment of fair market value is made based on the market value trends of similar public companies  the current business performance of the companies in which mdsi has invested  and if available  the estimated future market potential of the companies 
mdsi recorded an impairment of the investments in private companies and advances of million during this resulted in a full allowance against the recorded costs of the investments and advances 
during the year ended december  one of the companies in which mdsi had made an  equity investment was liquidated  with no net proceeds being realized by mdsi 
as a result mdsi has written off the investment of  against the valuation allowance set up during the year ended december  warranty the company warrants to its customers that its software will be in substantial conformance with its specifications 
indemnification the company typically includes indemnification provisions within license and implementation service agreements  which are consistent with those prevalent in the software industry 
such provisions indemnify customers against actions arising from patent infringements that may arise through the normal use or proper possession of the company s software 
to date the company has not experienced any significant obligations under customer indemnification provisions and accordingly  no amounts have been accrued for such potential indemnification obligations

the company s international business year ended december  compared to the year ended december  continued is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk we conduct business on a global basis in international currencies 
as such  we are exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign exchange rates 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars  the functional currency of our domestic operations and the currency in which we report our financial statements 
we also conduct a portion of our sales in currencies other than the us dollar  including the british pound and euro 
we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
all translation gains and losses are included in the determination of net income loss 
as exchange rates vary  these results when translated may impact our overall expected financial results 
we also have exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations when we translate cash from one currency into another to fund operational requirements 
in addition  we have exposure to the change in rates as the result of timing differences between expenses being incurred and paid 
as exchange rates vary  we may experience a negative impact on financial results 
we have evaluated our exposure to foreign currency risk and have determined that while we have a degree of exposure to the euro and british pound  our most significant operating exposure to foreign currencies at this time is to the canadian dollar 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar has negatively affected our operating results 
as of december   the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates applied to our foreign currency sensitive contracts and assets would be approximately million 
the foreign currency sensitivity model is limited by the assumption that all foreign currencies  to which the company is exposed  would simultaneously change by 
such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
the sensitivity model does not include the inherent risks associated with anticipated future transactions denominated in foreign currencies or future forward contracts entered into for hedging purposes 
to minimize the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures  we occasionally use foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we do not use forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
from time to time we may also purchase canadian dollars in the open market and hold these funds in order to satisfy forecasted operating needs in canadian dollars at december  and december   we had no outstanding currency forward exchange contracts  and during the years ended december   and december  we did not enter into any forward exchange contracts 
we therefore did not record any gain or loss as a result of these contracts for the years ended december  or december  interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the investment of cash is regulated by our investment policy of which the primary objective is the security of principal 
among other selection criteria  the investment policy states that the term to maturity of investments cannot exceed one year in length 
we invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments  including government bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
our portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk 
these investments are typically denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies are operating balances and are only invested in demand or short term deposits of the local operating bank 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
while interest income on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  we believe that the impact of these fluctuations does not have a material effect on our financial position due to the short term nature of these financial instruments 
our interest income and interest expense are most sensitive to the general level of interest rates in canada and the united states 
sensitivity analysis is used to measure our interest rate risk 
based on analysis of our balances as of december   a basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
the company does not have any material exposure to commodity risks 
the company is exposed to economic and political changes in international markets where the company competes such as inflation rates  recession  foreign ownership restrictions and other external factors over which the company has no control  domestic and foreign government spending  budgetary and trade policies
