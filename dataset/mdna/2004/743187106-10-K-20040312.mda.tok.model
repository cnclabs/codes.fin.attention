the joint venture has the right to terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
if not terminated early  this agreement continues until the later of the expiration of the patents relating to alphavax system or seven years from the first commercial sale of the products developed using alphavax system 
the last of the presently issued patents expire in  however  patent applications filed in the united states and internationally that we have also licensed and patent term extensions may extend the period of our license rights  when and if such patent applications are allowed and issued or patent term extensions are granted 
rights and obligations we have the right generally to defend and enforce patents licensed by us  either in the first instance or if the licensor chooses not to do so 
in addition  our license agreement with ur labs regarding mntx gives us the right to prosecute and maintain the licensed patents 
we bear the cost of engaging in all of these activities with respect to our license agreements with sloan kettering for gmk  columbia for our hiv product candidates subject to the columbia license and ur labs for mntx 
with most of our other license agreements  the licensor bears the cost of engaging in all of these activities  although we may share in those costs under certain circumstances 
historically  our costs of defending patent rights  both our own and those we license  have not been material 
the licenses to which we are a party impose various milestone  commercialization  sublicensing  royalty and other payment  insurance  indemnification and other obligations on us and are subject to certain reservations of rights 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the termination of the applicable agreement  which would likely cause us to terminate the related development program and cause a complete loss of our investment in that program 

back to contents patents and proprietary technology our policy is to protect our proprietary technology  and we consider the protection of our rights to be important to our business 
in addition to seeking us patent protection for many of our inventions  we generally file patent applications in canada  japan  western european countries and additional foreign countries on a selective basis in order to protect the inventions that we consider to be important to the development of our foreign business 
generally  patents issued in the united states are effective for the longer of years from the date of issue or years from the earliest effective filing date of the corresponding patent application  if the patent application was filed prior to june   and years from the earliest filing date for patent applications filed on or after june  in addition  in certain instances  the patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during the fda regulatory review period 
the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our product areas 
we require our employees  consultants and corporate partners who have access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality agreements 
as of march   our patent portfolio relating to our proprietary technologies in the hiv  cancer and symptom management areas is comprised  on a worldwide basis  of patents that are issued or allowed and pending patent applications  which we either own directly or of which we are the exclusive licensee 
the issued patents that we own expire on dates ranging from through however  we have filed a number of united states and foreign patent applications related to mntx  our hiv attachment technology  our technology directed to pro and pro  our provax technology and clinical uses of these technologies 
we have also filed a number of united states and foreign patent applications  one of which is owned jointly with the aaron diamond aids research center  relating to the discovery of an hiv co receptor  ccr patent term extensions and these pending patent applications may extend the period of patent protection afforded our products in development  when and if such patent term extensions and patent applications are allowed and issued or patent term extensions are granted 
our patent portfolio includes united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications that relate to our products in development in the hiv  cancer  symptom management and supportive care areas and of which we are the exclusive licensee 
this portion of our patent portfolio is described in more detail below 
under a license agreement with ur labs  inc see licenses ur labs  we obtained worldwide exclusive rights to specified technology relating to mntx 
this technology is the subject of issued us and european patents and several related us and foreign patent applications filed by the university of chicago relating to certain compositions  formulations and uses of mntx 
the last of the presently issued patents expire in  however  patent applications that we have also licensed and patent term extensions may extend the period of patent protection  when and if such patent applications are allowed and issued or patent term extensions are granted 
furthermore  we have continued to expand the patent coverage relating to mntx with the filing of new patent applications that may extend the patent protection period for mntx when and if such patent applications are allowed and issued 
under a license agreement with sloan kettering see licenses sloan kettering  we obtained worldwide exclusive rights to specified technology relating to ganglioside conjugate vaccines  including gmk  and its use to treat or prevent cancer 
this technology is the subject of a patent filed by sloan kettering in the united states and foreign countries claiming composition of matter and methods of production and use of specified ganglioside conjugate vaccines for the treatment or prevention of human cancer 
the currently issued patents expire in however  pending patent applications that we have also licensed and patent term extensions may extend the period of patent protection  when and if such patent applications are allowed and issued or patent term extensions are granted 
under a license agreement with columbia university see licenses columbia university  we obtained worldwide  exclusive rights to specified technology relating to cd this technology is the subject of issued us and european patents and several related us and foreign patent applications filed by columbia university 
the issued patents and the patent applications claim composition of matter and methods of production and use of specified cd based products for the treatment or prevention of hiv infection 
the issued patents covered by this license agreement expire on dates ranging from to  however  patent applications that we have also licensed and patent term extensions may extend the period of patent protection  when and if such patent applications are allowed and issued or patent term extensions are granted 

back to contents the research  development and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical often involves alternative development and optimization routes  which are presented at various stages in the development process 
the preferred routes cannot be predicted at the outset of a research and development program because they will depend upon subsequent discoveries and test results 
there are numerous third party patents in our field  and it is possible that to pursue the preferred development route of one or more of our products we will need to obtain a license to a patent  which would decrease the ultimate profitability of the applicable product 
if we cannot negotiate a license  we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether 
government regulation progenics and our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by the food and drug administration in the united states and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate  among other things  the preclinical and clinical testing  safety  effectiveness  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing  export  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of our products 
none of our product candidates has received marketing or other approval from the fda or any other similar regulatory authority 
fda approval of our products  including a review of the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce such products  will be required before such products may be marketed in the united states 
the process of obtaining approvals from the fda can be costly  time consuming and subject to unanticipated delays 
we cannot assure you that approvals of our proposed products  processes  or facilities will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if we experience delays in obtaining  or do not obtain  approvals for our products  commercialization of our products would be slowed or stopped 
moreover  even if we obtain regulatory approval  the approval may include significant limitations on indicated uses for which the product could be marketed or other significant marketing restrictions 
the process required by the fda before our products may be approved for marketing in the united states generally involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication  submission to the fda of a marketing application  and fda review of the marketing application in order to determine  among other things  whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to gain preliminary information about a product s pharmacology and toxicology and to identify any safety problems that would preclude testing in humans 
products must generally be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices  and preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with fda regulations regarding good laboratory practices 
the results of the preclinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of an ind investigational new drug application 
an ind is a submission which the sponsor of a clinical trial of an investigational new drug must make to the fda and which must become effective before clinical trials may commence 
the ind submission must include  among other things a description of the sponsor s investigational plan  protocols for each planned study  chemistry  manufacturing  and control information  pharmacology and toxicology information  and a summary of previous human experience with the investigational drug 

back to contents unless the fda objects to  makes comments or raises questions concerning an ind  the ind will become effective days following its receipt by the fda  and initial clinical studies may begin  although companies often obtain affirmative fda approval before beginning such studies 
we cannot assure you that submission of an ind will result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials 
a new drug application  or nda  is an application to the fda to market a new drug 
the nda must contain  among other things information on chemistry  manufacturing  and controls  non clinical pharmacology and toxicology  human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability  and clinical data 
the new drug may not be marketed in the united states until the fda has approved the nda 
the fda may not approve any nda or bla we submit in a timely maner or at all 
a biologic license application  or bla  is an application to the fda to market a biological product 
the bla must contain  among other things  data derived from nonclinical laboratory and clinical studies which demonstrate that the product meets prescribed standards of safety  purity and potency  and a full description of manufacturing methods 
the biological product may not be marketed in the united states until a biologic license is issued 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s good clinical practice requirements under protocols that detail  among other things  the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety  and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
further  each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board 
the institutional review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects  the possible liability of the institution and the informed consent disclosure which must be made to participants in the clinical trial 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap 
during phase  when the drug is initially administered to human subjects  the product is tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
phase involves studies in a limited patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific  targeted indications  determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a new product is found to have an effect and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase evaluation  phase trials are undertaken in order to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population 
the fda may suspend clinical trials at any point in this process if it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of the preclinical studies and clinical studies  the chemistry and manufacturing data  and the proposed labeling  among other things  are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla  approval of which must be obtained prior to commencement of commercial sales 
the fda may refuse to accept the application for filing if certain administrative and content criteria are not satisfied  and even after accepting the application for review  the fda may require additional testing or information before approval of the application 
our analysis of the results of our clinical studies is subject to review and interpretation by the fda  which may differ from our analysis 
we cannot assure you that our data or our interpretation of data will be accepted by the fda 
in any event  the fda must deny an nda or bla if applicable regulatory requirements are not ultimately satisfied 
in addition  we may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in applicable law or fda policy during the period of product development and fda regulatory review 
moreover  if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may be made subject to various conditions  including post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of the product  or may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
finally  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing 

back to contents both before and after approval is obtained  a product  its manufacturer  and the sponsor of the marketing application for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight 
violations of regulatory requirements at any stage  including the preclinical and clinical testing process  the approval process  or thereafter  may result in various adverse consequences  including fda delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  withdrawal of an approved product from the market or the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer or sponsor 
in addition  later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such product  manufacturer  or sponsor  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
also  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a pharmaceutical product by comparable government regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to marketing such product in such countries 
the approval procedure varies from country to country  and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
although there are some procedures for unified filing for certain european countries  in general  each country has its own procedures and requirements 
we do not currently have any facilities or personnel outside of the united states 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we are also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act and various other present and potential future federal  state or local regulations 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for storing  handling  using and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contaminations or injury from these materials 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any legal and regulatory violations as well as damages that result 
any such liability could have a material adverse effect on progenics 
manufacturing we currently manufacture pro  pro  gmk and psma protein vaccines in our two biologics pilot production facilities in tarrytown  new york 
one of these facilities is for the production of vaccines and the other is for the production of recombinant proteins 
we are preparing to install in a  liter bioreactor  which we expect will be operational in early this new facility will utilize our new cell line to provide us with an additional source of clinical supplies of pro and will also be utilized to manufacture supplies of pro and psma protein vaccines in support of our clinical programs 
we believe that our existing production facilities will be sufficient to meet our initial needs for clinical trials for these product candidates 
however  these facilities may be insufficient for all of our late stage clinical trials for these product candidates and would be insufficient for commercial scale requirements 
we may be required to further expand our manufacturing staff and facilities  obtain new facilities or contract with third parties or corporate collaborators to assist with production 
we currently rely on single source third party manufacturers for the supply of both bulk and finished form mntx 
we believe that our existing arrangements with such single source third party manufacturers are stable  reliable and adequate for the balance of our clinical trial and initial commercial supply requirements 
however  to ensure redundancies in our supply chain we continue to be actively engaged in a program to further expand our existing relationships  as well as to identify additional manufacturers for bulk and finished form mntx as supplements and backup to our current arrangements 
in the event we decide to establish a full scale commercial manufacturing facility for any or all of our products  we would need to spend substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with the extensive fda regulations applicable to such a facility 
sales and marketing we plan to market products for which we obtain regulatory approval through co marketing  co promotion  licensing and distribution arrangements with third party collaborators 
we may also consider contracting with a third party professional pharmaceutical detailing and sales organization to perform the marketing function for our products 
we believe that our current approach allows us maximum flexibility of selecting the marketing method that will both increase market penetration and commercial acceptance of our products and enable us to avoid expending significant funds to develop a large sales and marketing organization 
cytogen has certain marketing rights with respect to the psma products covered by the joint venture agreement 
competition competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and characterized by ongoing research and development and technological change 
we face competition from many companies and major universities and research institutions in the united states and abroad 
we will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products for diseases targeted by our technologies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  experience in conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  operating experience  research and development and marketing capabilities and production capabilities than we do 
we cannot assure you that our products under development will compete successfully with existing products or products under development by other companies  universities and other institutions 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda approval for products more rapidly than we do 
drug manufacturers that are first in the market with a therapeutic for a specific indication generally obtain and maintain a significant competitive advantage over later entrants 
accordingly  the speed with which we can develop products  complete the clinical trials and approval processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 

back to contents with respect to mntx  there are currently no fda approved products for reversing the debilitating side effects of opioid pain therapy or for the treatment of post operative bowel dysfunction 
we are  however  aware of a product candidate in advanced clinical development that targets these therapeutic indications  but its effects are limited solely to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract  whereas mntx is available systemically 
with respect to our products for the treatment of hiv infection  three classes of products made by our competitors have been approved for marketing by the fda for the treatment of hiv infection and aids reverse transcriptase inhibitors  protease inhibitors and entry inhibitors 
these drugs have shown efficacy in reducing the concentration of hiv in the blood and prolonging asymptomatic periods in hiv positive individuals  especially when administered in combination 
with respect to gmk  the fda and certain other regulatory authorities have approved high dose alpha interferon for marketing as a treatment for patients with high risk melanoma 
high dose alpha interferon has demonstrated efficacy for this indication 
with respect to the immunotherapeutic products based on psma that we are developing through our pdc joint venture  there are traditional forms of treatment for prostate cancer such as surgery  radiation therapy  chemotherapy and hormone therapy 
however  if the disease spreads these forms of treatment can be ineffective 
we are aware of several competitors who are developing alternate forms of treatment including in vivo and ex vivo immunotherapies  some of which are directed against psma and are in early stage clinical trials 
a significant amount of research in the biopharmaceutical field is also being carried out at academic and government institutions 
an element of our research and development strategy is to in license technology and product candidates from academic and government institutions 
these institutions are becoming increasingly sensitive to the commercial value of their findings and are becoming more aggressive in pursuing patent protection and negotiating licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed 
these institutions may also market competitive commercial products on their own or in collaboration with competitors and will compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel 
any resulting increase in the cost or decrease in the availability of technology or product candidates from these institutions may adversely affect our business strategy 
competition with respect to our technologies and product candidates is and will be based  among other things  on efficacy and safety of our products  timing and scope of regulatory approval  product reliability and availability  marketing and sales capabilities  capabilities of our collaborators  reimbursement coverage from insurance companies and others  degree of clinical benefits of our product candidates relative to their costs  method of administering a product  price  and patent protection 
our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 
competitive disadvantages in any of these factors could materially harm our business and financial condition 

back to contents product liability the testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products involves an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects 
to the extent we elect to test  manufacture or market products independently  we will bear the risk of product liability directly 
we have obtained product liability insurance coverage in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a deductible and a million aggregate limitation 
in addition  where the local statutory requirements exceed the limits of our existing insurance or local policies of insurance are required  we maintain additional clinical trial liability insurance to meet these requirements 
this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations 
we may not be able to continue to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost  or in adequate amounts 
environment we seek to comply with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements concerning environmental quality 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures for environmental compliance and protection 
expenditures for compliance with environmental laws have not had  and are not expected to have  a material effect on our capital expenditures  results of operation  or competitive position 
human resources at december   we had full time employees  of whom  including dr 
maddon  hold phd degrees or foreign equivalents and four of whom  including dr 
maddon  hold md degrees 
at such date  employees were engaged in research and development  medical and regulatory affairs and manufacturing activities and were engaged in finance  legal  administration and business development 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

scientific advisory boards and consultants an important component of our scientific strategy is our collaborative relationship with leading researchers in cancer and virology 
certain of these researchers are members of our two scientific advisory boards sab  one in cancer and one in virology 
the members of each sab attend periodic meetings and provide us with specific expertise in both research and clinical development 
in addition  we have collaborative research relationships with certain individual sab members 
all members of the sabs are employed by employers other than us and may have commitments to or consulting or advisory agreements with other entities that may limit their availability to us 
these companies may also compete with us 
several members of the sabs have  from time to time  devoted significant time and energy to our affairs 
however  no member is regularly expected to devote more than a small portion of time to progenics 
in general  our scientific advisors are granted stock options in progenics and receive financial remuneration for their services

back to contents risk factors our business and operations entail a variety of risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
our product development programs are inherently risky 
we are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of product candidates based on new technologies 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the possibility that the technologies we use will not be effective  our product candidates will be unsafe or otherwise fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals  our product candidates will be hard to manufacture on a large scale or will not be economical to market  or we do not successfully overcome technological challenges presented by our products 
our mntx product candidate is based on a novel method of action  which has not yet been proven to be safe or effective 
additionally  some of our hiv product candidates are designed to be effective by blocking viral entry  and our gmk product candidate is designed to be a therapeutic cancer vaccine 
to our knowledge  other than trimeris fuzeon product  no drug designed to treat hiv infection by blocking viral entry and no cancer therapeutic vaccine has been approved for marketing in the us our other research and development programs involve similarly novel approaches to human therapeutics 
consequently  there is little precedent for the successful commercialization of products based on our technologies 
we may not be able to develop successfully any of our products 
if we cannot advance our products beyond the early stages of product development or demonstrate clinical efficacy  we will never commercialize a product 
many of our products are at an early stage of development 
the successful commercialization of our products will require significant further research  development  testing and regulatory approvals and additional investment 
if we cannot advance our products beyond the early stages of product development or demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety  we will never commercialize a product 
there are a number of technological challenges that we must overcome to complete most of our development efforts 
our products in the research or preclinical development stage may not yield results that would permit or justify clinical testing 
furthermore  products that advance to clinical testing may not be commercialized 
a setback in our clinical development programs could adversely affect us 
we have several ongoing late stage clinical trials 
we have two ongoing pivotal phase clinical trials for mntx in patients with advanced medical illness 
it is likely that we will need to successfully complete both of these trials in order to obtain fda approval to market mntx 
we have also commenced a phase clinical trial of mntx for another indication and an additional phase trial involving mntx in a third indication 
if the results of any of these trials are not satisfactory  or if we encounter clinical trial supply issues  our mntx development program would be adversely affected  resulting in delays in the commencement of planned trials and our regulatory filing 
the need to conduct additional clinical trials or significant revisions to our clinical development plan would lead to delays in our filing for and obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market mntx 
since mntx is our most clinically advanced product  a setback of this nature would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also have two ongoing pivotal phase clinical trials for gmk 
in may  our collaborating research cooperative group in one of these trials  ecog  recommended to clinical investigators participating in the trial that they discontinue administering gmk 
ecog s decision was based on an early analysis of data which  according to ecog  showed that the relapse free and overall survival rates for patients receiving the gmk vaccine were lower than for patients receiving high dose alpha interferon 
as a result of the actions of ecog  that trial did not complete patient dosing as contemplated by the initial trial protocol 
we are continuing to follow up with patients who were enrolled in that trial 
however  we cannot predict how long this will take or what the results will show  and we do not expect to know the results much before the end or later 
the second pivotal phase trial for gmk being conducted with europe s leading cancer cooperative group  eortc  was initiated in may and at present we do not expect to reach the full enrollment of  patients until mid if the results of either of the gmk trials are not satisfactory  we may need to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon our gmk program 

back to contents additionally  if the results of our early stage studies with pro  pro or our psma vaccine and antibody candidates are not satisfactory  we would need to reconfigure our clinical trial programs to conduct additional trials or abandon the program involved 
we may be delayed in commencing or completing our clinical trials 
although for planning purposes we forecast the commencement and completion of clinical trials  and have included many of those forecasts in this annual report on form k  the actual timing of these events can vary dramatically 
delays can be caused by regulatory or patent issues  interim or final results of on going clinical trials  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions and the rate of patient accruals 
clinical trials involving our product candidates may not commence or be completed as forecasted 
moreover  we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials  and we rely on others to conduct  supervise or monitor some or all aspects of some of our clinical trials 
in addition  certain clinical trials for our products may be conducted by government sponsored agencies  and consequently will be dependent on governmental participation and funding 
we will have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted them entirely on our own 
as a result of these and other factors  our clinical trials may not commence or be completed as we expect or may not be conducted successfully  in which event investors confidence in our ability to develop products may be impaired and our stock price may decline 
if testing does not yield successful results  our products will not be approved 
to achieve the results we need to obtain regulatory approval  we or our collaborators must demonstrate a product s safety and efficacy in humans through extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
numerous events may arise during  or as a result of  the testing process  including the following the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  potential products may not have the desired efficacy or may have undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved  results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials  after reviewing test results  we or our collaborators may abandon projects which we might previously have believed to be promising  some of which may be described in this annual report on form k  and we  our collaborators or regulators may suspend or terminate clinical trials  if we or they believe that the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
clinical testing is very expensive and can take many years 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product  which could adversely affect our operating results and credibility 
even if we get our products approved  they might not be accepted in the marketplace 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payors as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
even if our products obtain regulatory approval  they may not achieve market acceptance 
if any of our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will likely lose our entire investment in that product 
marketplace acceptance will depend in part on competition in our industry  which is intense 
the extent to which any of our products achieve market acceptance will depend on competitive factors 
competition in our industry is intense  and it is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development 
there are products currently in the market that will compete with the products that we are developing  including chemotherapy drugs and aids drugs 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
these competitors may develop products that are superior to those we are developing and render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
if our product candidates receive marketing approval but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace  our operating results and financial position would suffer 

back to contents a competitor developing an opioid antagonist may reach the market ahead of us 
we are aware that adolor corporation  in partnership with glaxo group limited  or glaxo  a subsidiary of glaxosmithkline plc  is developing an opioid antagonist  entereg alvimopan  for post operative ileus  which has completed phase clinical trials  and for chronic opioid bowel dysfunction and acute opioid induced bowel dysfunction  which are currently in phase trials 
entereg is further along in the clinical development process than mntx 
if entereg reaches the market before mntx  it could achieve a significant competitive advantage relative to mntx 
in any event  the considerable marketing and sales capabilities of glaxo may impair our ability to penetrate the market 
if we lose our current or future collaborative partners  or if they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and operating results may suffer 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborations with corporate partners  primarily pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies  for one or more of the research  development  manufacturing  marketing and other commercialization activities relating to our product candidates 
if we lose our current or future collaborative partners  or if they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations  our product development and operating results may suffer 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our current or future collaborators to their collaborations with us is not within our control 
if any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us  or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the commercialization of our product candidates could be slowed down or blocked completely 
our collaborative partners may change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products  either on their own or in collaboration with others  as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs 
our revenues and earnings also will be affected by the effectiveness of our corporate partners in marketing any successfully developed products 
our current or future collaborations may not be successful  and we may not receive any funding from them 
disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters  including financial or other obligations under our contracts  the most promising scientific or regulatory route to pursue or our respective ownership of intellectual property rights 
these disputes may be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of product candidates 
our level of commitment to fund the psma joint venture and that of our joint venture partner  cytogen  is based upon an annual budget and work plan that is developed and approved by both parties 
we have  in the past  experienced delays in reaching agreement with cytogen regarding annual budget issues and strategic and operational matters relating to the joint venture 
while we and cytogen have an established process for reaching agreement on these matters  we might  from time to time  not succeed in a timely fashion  which could result in delays in advancing our psma programs or  if we do not reach agreement at all would ultimately lead to the dissolution of the joint venture and perhaps abandonment of the psma programs being conducted by the joint venture 
currently  we have an approved budget and work plan for  however  this does not commit either party to any level of funding beyond the current year 
in the event that an annual budget is not approved beyond  we and cytogen are required to fund any remaining obligations upon dissolution of the joint venture in accordance with the llc agreement 
if we are unable to negotiate additional collaborative agreements  our cash burn rate could increase and our rate of product development could decrease 
we intend to continue to pursue new collaborative agreements in the future 
for instance  we are currently in discussions with potential strategic collaborators for mntx 
however  we may not be successful in negotiating additional collaborative arrangements 
if we do not enter into new collaborative arrangements  we would have to devote more of our resources to clinical product development and product launch activities  and our cash burn rate would increase or we would need to take steps to reduce our rate of product development 

back to contents if we do not remedy our current failure to achieve milestones or satisfy certain conditions regarding some of our product candidates  we may not maintain our rights under our licenses relating to these product candidates 
we are required to make substantial cash payments  achieve specified milestones and satisfy other conditions  including filing for and obtaining product approvals and introducing products  to maintain our rights under our licenses  including our licenses from ur labs  inc  sloan kettering institute for cancer research and columbia university 
we may not be able to maintain our rights under these licenses 
under our license agreements relating to gmk and our hiv product candidates  including pro  we are required  among other things  to have filed for marketing approval for a drug by and to commence commercialization of the drug by for gmk and to have filed for marketing approval by for the hiv products 
we have not achieved these and other milestones and are unlikely to achieve them soon 
if we can establish that our failure to achieve these milestones was as a result of technical issues beyond our control or delays in clinical studies that could not have been reasonably avoided  we may be entitled under these license agreements to a revision of these milestone dates 
although we believe that we satisfy one or more of these conditions  we may become involved in disputes with our licensors as to our continued right to a license 
we are also required under our license agreement with ur labs to file an nda by december  if we do not comply with our obligations under our license agreements  the licensors may terminate them 
termination of any of our licenses could result in our losing our rights to  and therefore being unable to commercialize  any related product 
we have on going discussions with sloan kettering and columbia to reach agreement on the revision of applicable milestone dates  however  there can be no assurance of a positive outcome 
we have a history of operating losses  and we may never be profitable 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have derived no significant revenues from product sales or royalties  and we do not expect to achieve significant product sales or royalty revenue for a number of years  if ever 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future  which could increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial efforts 
our ability to achieve long term profitability is dependent in part on obtaining regulatory approvals for products and entering into agreements for commercialization of our products 
however  our operations may not be profitable even if any of our products under development are commercialized 
we are likely to need additional financing  but our access to capital funding is uncertain 
our current and anticipated development projects require substantial capital 
we are likely to need substantial additional funds to conduct product development activities 
we believe that our current capital resources  together with revenue from currently approved government grants and contracts and revenue from the services we perform for our jv with cytogen  should be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the first half of we cannot predict with any certainty when we will need additional funds or how much we will need 
our need for future funding will depend on numerous factors  many of which are outside our control 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our access to capital funding is uncertain 
we do not have committed external sources of funding for most of our drug discovery and development projects  and we may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs  obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our current stockholders will be diluted  and new investors could have rights superior to our existing stockholders 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities  which could adversely impact our ability to commercialize products 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities  which may result in increased costs of production or delay product development or commercialization 
in order to commercialize our product candidates successfully  we or our collaborators must be able to manufacture products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner 
the manufacture of our product candidates can be complex  difficult to accomplish even in small quantities  difficult to scale up when large scale production is required and subject to delays  inefficiencies and poor or low yields of quality products 
the cost of manufacturing some of our products may make them prohibitively expensive 
if supplies of any of our product candidates or related materials become unavailable to us on a timely basis or at all or are contaminated or otherwise lost  our clinical trials could be seriously delayed  since these materials are time consuming to manufacture and cannot be readily obtained from third party sources 

back to contents we have constructed two pilot scale manufacturing facilities  one for the production of vaccines and one for the production of recombinant proteins 
we believe that  for these types of product candidates  these facilities will be sufficient to meet our initial needs for clinical trials 
however  these facilities may be insufficient for late stage clinical trials for these types of product candidates  and would be insufficient for commercial scale manufacturing requirements 
we may be required to expand further our manufacturing staff and facilities  obtain new facilities or contract with corporate collaborators or other third parties to assist with production 
in the event that we decide to establish a commercial scale manufacturing facility  we will require substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train significant numbers of employees and comply with applicable regulations  which are extensive 
we may not be able to build a manufacturing facility that both meets regulatory requirements and is sufficient for our clinical trials or commercial scale manufacturing 
we have entered into arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of some of our products 
our third party sourcing strategy may not result in a cost effective means for manufacturing products 
in employing third party manufacturers  we will not control many aspects of the manufacturing process  including their compliance with current good manufacturing practices and other regulatory requirements 
we may not be able to obtain adequate supplies from third party manufacturers in a timely fashion for development or commercialization purposes  and commercial quantities of products may not be available from contract manufacturers at acceptable costs 
manufacturing pro in amounts sufficient to support large scale clinical trials has proven particularly difficult  which could delay clinical development 
pro is a recombinant protein  which generally involves more complex production methods than small molecule drugs 
we are pursuing alternative  potentially redundant manufacturing strategies  including expanding our internal manufacturing through mammalian cell line fermentation  a standard recombinant manufacturing process  and more sophisticated methods  such as transgenics 
nevertheless  manufacturing pro is challenging  and these challenges could increase the cost of production  delay product development or commercialization or otherwise adversely impact our ability to commercialize pro we are subject to extensive regulation  which can be costly and time consuming and can subject us to unanticipated fines and delays 
we and our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda in the us and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate  among other things  the preclinical and clinical testing  safety  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing  export  storage  record keeping  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
if we violate regulatory requirements at any stage  whether before or after marketing approval is obtained  we may be subject to forced removal of a product from the market  product seizure  civil and criminal penalties and other adverse consequences 
we do not yet have  and may never obtain  the regulatory approvals we need to successfully market our products 
none of our products have been approved by applicable regulatory authorities for commercialization 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals  including foreign approvals  often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the products involved 
we have had only limited experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals 
the fda may not approve for marketing any of our products under development 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product we might not obtain labeling claims necessary to make the product commercially viable  we may be required to undertake post marketing trials to verify the product s efficacy or safety  identification of the side effects after the product is on the market or the occurrence of manufacturing problems could result in subsequent withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the product  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials  changes in labeling of the product or the need for additional marketing applications  and we will be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory review 

back to contents if we fail to receive regulatory approvals for our products  or we lose previously received approvals  our financial results would be adversely affected 
we are dependent on our patents and proprietary rights 
the validity  enforceability and commercial value of these rights are highly uncertain 
our success is dependent in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain and involves many complex legal and technical issues 
there is no clear policy involving the breadth of claims allowed  or the degree of protection afforded  under patents in this area 
accordingly  the patent applications owned by or licensed to us may not result in patents being issued 
furthermore  issued patents may not give us an advantage over competitors with similar technology 
we own or have licenses to several issued patents 
however  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability 
the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance by the patent office can be challenged in litigation 
our patents may be successfully challenged 
moreover  we may incur substantial costs in litigation to uphold the validity of patents or to prevent infringement 
if the outcome of litigation is adverse to us  third parties may be able to use our patented invention without payment to us 
moreover  third parties may avoid our patents through design innovation 
generally  we have the right to defend and enforce patents licensed by us  either in the first instance or if the licensor chooses not to do so 
in addition  our license agreement with ur labs regarding mntx gives us the right to prosecute and maintain the licensed patents 
we bear the cost of engaging in some or all of these activities with respect to our license agreements with sloan kettering for gmk  columbia for our hiv product candidates subject to the columbia license and ur labs for mntx 
with most of our other license agreements  the licensor bears the cost of engaging in all of these activities  although we may share in those costs under specified circumstances 
historically  our costs of defending patent rights  both our own and those we license  have not been material 
we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our technology or disclose our technology  and we may be unable to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
we require each of our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide effective protection in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this confidential information 
if we infringe third party patents  we may need to alter or terminate a product development program 
there may be patent rights belonging to others that require us to alter our products  pay licensing fees or cease certain activities 
if our products conflict with patent rights of others  they could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products 
if these legal actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products 
we may not prevail in any action brought against us  and any license required under any patent that we infringe may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
for example  we have filed a number of us and foreign patent applications  one of which is owned jointly with the aaron diamond aids research center  relating to the discovery of the hiv co receptor ccr we are aware that other groups have claimed discoveries similar to those covered by our patent applications 
we do not expect to know for several years the relative strength of our patent position as compared to these other groups 
we are aware of other intellectual property rights held by third parties that relate to products or technologies we are developing 
for example  we are aware of other groups investigating psma or related compounds that have patents or patent applications in this area 
if asserted against us  these rights could adversely affect our ability to commercialize some of our products 
the research  development and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical often involve alternative development and optimization routes  which are presented at various stages in the development process 
the preferred routes cannot be predicted at the outset of a research and development program because they will depend on subsequent discoveries and test results 
there are numerous third party patents in our field  and we may need to obtain a license to a patent in order to pursue the preferred development route of one or more of our products 
the need to obtain a license would decrease the ultimate profitability of the applicable product 
if we cannot negotiate a license  we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether 
we are dependent on third parties for a variety of functions  these arrangements may not provide us with the benefits we expect 
we rely in part on third parties to perform a variety of functions 
we are party to several agreements which place substantial responsibility on third parties for portions of the development of our products 
we also in license technology from medical and academic institutions in order to minimize investments in early research  and we enter into collaborative arrangements with certain of these entities with respect to clinical trials of product candidates 
we may not be able to maintain any of these relationships or establish new ones on beneficial terms 
furthermore  we may not be able to enter new arrangements without undue delays or expenditures  and these arrangements may not allow us to compete successfully 

back to contents we lack sales and marketing experience  which will make us dependent on third parties for their expertise in this area 
we have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
if we receive required regulatory approvals  we expect to market and sell our products  including mntx  principally through distribution  co marketing  co promotion or licensing arrangements with third parties 
we may also consider contracting with a third party professional pharmaceutical detailing and sales organization to perform the marketing function for our products 
we currently do not have a marketing partner for mntx 
to the extent that we enter into distribution  co marketing  co promotion  detailing or licensing arrangements for the marketing and sale of our products  any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of these third parties 
we will not control the amount and timing of marketing resources these third parties devote to our products 
in addition  if we market products directly  significant additional expenditures and management resources would be required to develop an internal sales force 
we may not be able to establish a successful sales force should we choose to do so 
if we lose key management and scientific personnel on whom we depend  our business could suffer 
we are dependent upon our key management and scientific personnel 
in particular  the loss of dr 
maddon  our chairman  chief executive officer and chief science officer  or mr 
prentki  our president  could cause our management and operations to suffer 
we have an employment agreement with dr 
maddon  the initial term of which runs through june   subject to an automatic renewal for an additional period of two years unless either party provides ninety days prior notice of non renewal 
we also have an employment agreement with mr 
prentki  the initial term of which runs through march  subject to automatic annual extensions unless either party provides six months prior notice of termination 
neither we nor mr 
prentki provided such notice  and we are currently negotiating a new employment agreement with him 
employment agreements do not  however  assure the continued employment of an employee 
we maintain key man life insurance on dr 
maddon in the amount of million 
competition for qualified employees among companies in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
in order to commercialize our products successfully  we may be required to expand substantially our personnel  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  clinical trials management  regulatory affairs  business development and marketing 
we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the raw and bulk materials needed to make our products  our product development and commercialization could be slowed or stopped 
we currently obtain supplies of critical raw materials used in production of mntx and gmk from single sources 
in particular  we rely on single source third party manufacturers for the supply of both bulk and finished form mntx 
however  we do not have long term contracts with any of these suppliers 
in addition  commercialization of gmk requires an adjuvant  qs  available only from antigenics  inc we have entered into a license and supply agreement with a subsidiary of antigenics pursuant to which they agreed to supply us with all of our qs requirements for use in certain ganglioside based cancer vaccines  including gmk 
our existing arrangements may not result in the supply of sufficient quantities of mntx or qs needed to accomplish our clinical development programs  and we may not have the right or capability to manufacture sufficient quantities of these products to meet our needs if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to do so 
any delay or disruption in the availability of raw materials would slow or stop product development and commercialization of the relevant product 
a substantial portion of our funding comes from federal government grants and research contracts 
we cannot rely on these grants or contracts as a continuing source of funds 
a substantial portion of our revenues to date has been derived from federal government grants and research contracts 
in addition to previous years awards  in we were awarded  in the aggregate  approximately million in national institutes of health grants and research contracts 
we cannot rely on grants or additional contracts as a continuing source of funds 
the government s obligation to make payments under these grants and contracts is subject to appropriation by the us congress for funding in each year 
moreover  it is possible that congress or the government agencies that administer these government research programs will decide to scale back these programs or terminate them due to their own budgetary constraints 
additionally  these grants and research contracts are subject to adjustment based upon the results of periodic audits performed on behalf of the granting authority 
consequently  the government may not award grants or research contracts to us in the future  and any amounts that we derive from existing grants or contracts may be less than those received to date 

back to contents if health care reform measures are enacted  our operating results and our ability to commercialize products could be adversely affected 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the health care system in the us and in foreign jurisdictions 
some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
in some foreign countries  particularly countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control 
in addition  as a result of the trend towards managed health care in the us  as well as legislative proposals to reduce government insurance programs  third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drug products 
consequently  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
if we or any of our collaborators succeed in bringing one or more of our products to market  third party payors may establish and maintain price levels insufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
significant changes in the health care system in the united states or elsewhere  including changes resulting from adverse trends in third party reimbursement programs  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to raise capital and commercialize products 
we are exposed to product liability claims  and in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance against these claims at a reasonable cost or at all 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
we may not be able to avoid product liability exposure 
if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us  our financial position may be adversely affected 
product liability insurance for the biopharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  when available at all 
we have obtained product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a deductible and a million aggregate limitation 
in addition  where local statutory requirements exceed the limits of our existing insurance or where local policies of insurance are required  we maintain additional clinical trial liability insurance to meet these requirements 
our present insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims brought against us 
in addition  some of our license and other agreements require us to obtain product liability insurance 
adequate insurance coverage may not be available to us at a reasonable cost in the future 
we handle hazardous materials and must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which can be expensive and restrict how we do business 
if we are involved in a hazardous waste spill or other accident we could be liable for damages  penalties or other forms of censure 
our research and development work and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous  controlled and radioactive materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
despite precautionary procedures that we implement for handling and disposing of these materials  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury 
in the event of a hazardous waste spill or other accident  we could be liable for damages  penalties or other forms of censure 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future or we may be materially and adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations

maddon and stockholders affiliated with tudor investment corporation together beneficially own or control approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock

the issuance of preferred stock  as well as provisions in certain of our stock options that provide for acceleration of exercisability upon a change of control  and section and other provisions of the delaware general corporation law could make the takeover of progenics or the removal of our board of directors or management more difficult  discourage hostile bids for control of progenics in which stockholders may receive a premium for their shares of common stock  and otherwise dilute the rights of holders of our common stock and depress the market price of our common stock

item properties we sublease approximately  square feet of laboratory  manufacturing and office space in tarrytown  new york 
we sublease this space pursuant to a sublease which terminates in june  with an option to renew for two two year terms 
we have two pilot production facilities within these leased facilities for the manufacture of products for clinical trials 
the base monthly rent for our sublease is  from january  through june   plus additional utility charges 
on september  we executed a lease for approximately  square feet of additional laboratory  manufacturing and office space in tarrytown  new york 
the commencement dates of the lease for these spaces range from october  to march   subject to certain acceleration provisions with regard to some of the spaces

back to contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview progenics is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative products to treat the unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating conditions and life threatening diseases 
we commenced principal operations in late and since that time have been engaged primarily in research and development efforts  development of our manufacturing capabilities  establishment of corporate collaborations and raising capital 
in order to commercialize the principal products that we have under development  we will need to address a number of technological challenges and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the amount of funds that will be required or the length of time that will pass before we receive revenues from sales of any of these products 
to date  product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents 
we expect that sales of research reagents in the future will not significantly increase over current levels 
our other sources of revenues through december  have been payments received under our collaboration agreements and from psma development company llc  our joint venture with cytogen corporation the jv  research grants and contracts related to our cancer and hiv programs and interest income 
to date  a majority of our expenditures have been for research and development activities see part i item business 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly as our programs progress and our related clinical and regulatory activity levels increase 
with the exception of the years ended december  and  we have had recurring losses and had  at december   an accumulated deficit of approximately  we will require additional funds to complete the development of our products  to fund the cost of clinical trials and to fund operating losses that are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
we do not expect our products under development to be commercialized in the near future 
we have a ownership interest in the jv 
we were required to fund the first million of research and development costs and such amounts were recorded as capital contributions to and losses in the jv 
during the fourth quarter of  we surpassed the million threshold  at which time we began recognizing revenue for services and costs being provided to and paid by the jv 
we currently recognize our portion of the jv s loss 
prior to reaching the million threshold  we recognized of the jv s research and development losses 
we provide services to the jv under the terms of a services agreement between progenics and cytogen collectively  the members and the jv 
as of march   and through january   we were performing services for the jv under a month to month extension of the services agreement 
the services agreement expired effective january  and the members have not yet agreed upon the terms of a replacement services agreement  if any 
the members agreed to a budget for and their respective capital contributions for the year 
the jv s work plan  budget and other operational and financial matters relating to periods after will require the agreement of the members 
if we do not agree on terms for future periods  our revenues could be adversely affected 

back to contents results of operations years ended december  and revenues we recognized  and  of revenue for research and development services performed for the jv during and  respectively 
approximately  of the amount recognized in represents reimbursement for third party expense paid by us 
such expenses were paid directly from the jv in based on the budget  we expect to recognize approximately million of revenue for services provided to the jv during the level of future revenues from the jv will be dependent upon the extent of research and development services requested by the jv and the future financial position of the jv 
according to the joint venture agreement  and in consideration of our initial incremental capital contribution and recognition of million of joint venture research expenses  we may directly pursue and obtain government grants directed to the conduct of research utilizing psma related technologies  and receive related amounts not to exceed million 
through december   we had recognized approximately  of revenue from five such government grants  which is included in research grant revenue in our accompanying financial statements 
proceeds received from the jv for research activities for which the company has also received such corresponding grant revenue is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as an adjustment to joint venture losses and contract revenue from the joint venture 
on behalf of the jv  we have applied for additional grant funding 
other contract research and development revenue declined from  in to in as our commitments for such work were completed 
revenues from research grants and contracts increased from  in to  in the increase resulted from the funding of a greater number of grants and contracts in expenses research and development expenses include scientific labor  supplies  facility costs  clinical trial costs  patent costs  and product manufacturing costs 
research and development expenses increased  from  in to  in during  such expenses included approximately  of salaries and benefits   in lab supplies   to clinical research organizations   for contract manufacturing and subcontractors   for operating expense and travel   in license fees and  for consultants 
the increase was principally due to i an increase of  related to an increase in headcount from in to in in the research and development  manufacturing and medical departments and ii an increase of  in manufacturing supplies and clinical trial costs for mntx  offset by i a decrease of  in psma supplies purchase for the jv such supplies were purchased directly by the jv in  ii a decrease of  in contract manufacturing and supplies for pro  iii a decrease of  in subcontractor costs for under grants and contracts and iv a decrease of  in general lab supplies and miscellaneous 
we expect to incur significant increases in research and development costs related to mntx as the clinical programs expand and progress 
spending in other programs is expected to remain relatively stable 

back to contents general and administrative expenses include executive and administrative labor  professional fees  office rent and supplies 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in the  increase was principally due to i an increase of  related to an increase in administrative headcount  ii an increase of  in professional fees including patent costs  recruiting and audit related fees and iii an increase of  in operating expenses including rent  insurance and office supplies 
loss in joint venture decreased from  in to  in as further described above  during  we recognized approximately  of payments received from the jv as an adjustment to jv losses and contract revenue from the jv 
the level of future losses from the jv will be dependent upon the extent of research and development costs expended by the jv and the future financial position of the jv

our net loss was  in compared to a net loss of  in years ended december  and revenues we recognized  and  of revenue for research and development services performed for the jv during and  respectively 
other contract research and development revenue declined from  in to  in primarily due to a decrease in funding received from bristol myers squibb company bms after we and bms mutually terminated our collaboration agreement in may we received  from bms in under the agreement and in revenues from contract research and development performed for other collaborators decreased from  in to  in as our commitments for such work were completed

back to contents general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged at  in and  in loss in joint venture increased from  in to  in the increase was primarily due to the growth and acceleration of the jv s development programs to develop in vivo immunotherapies for prostate cancer and the costs of licensing transactions 
the increase in the jv loss was due to an increase in the headcount assigned to the psma project and the related cost of supplies 
additionally  prior to reaching the million threshold  we recognized of the jv s research and development losses  that percentage was reduced to subsequent to reaching that threshold in december depreciation and amortization increased from  in to  in as we purchased capital assets and made leasehold improvements in to accommodate expansion

our net loss was  in compared to a net loss of  in liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations since inception primarily through three public offerings of common stock  private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaboration agreements  funding under government research grants and contracts  interest on investments  a line of credit that was repaid and terminated and the proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in november  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the managing underwriters for this offering were citigroup  cibc world markets corp  lazard  legg mason wood walker  incorporated and punk  ziegel company 
net proceeds to the company after expenses were million 
we are using the proceeds from the offering for the funding of clinical trials of product candidates  expansion of our manufacturing facilities and research and development projects as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million compared with million at december  the cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the same period in the increase in cash used in operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from higher net losses resulting from increased research and development activity in connection with mntx  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 

back to contents the cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million of cash provided by investing activities for the same period in the cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of million of marketable securities offset by the purchase of million of marketable securities and the purchase of million of fixed assets including capital equipment and leasehold improvements as we acquired and built out additional research and development space

such amount was million during the level of commitment by progenics and cytogen to fund the jv is based on a budget that is approved annually by the members 
that budget is intended to be sufficient to fund research and development projects for the current year 
the budget must also consider the ability of the members to fund the jv 
the members have approved an annual budget of approximately million and a work plan for the year pursuant to which  among other things  the members are engaged in a research and development program on behalf of the jv with the majority of the work to be performed by progenics 
the budget requires capital contributions of million from each member during for the year ended december   we recognized approximately  of contract research and development revenue for services performed on behalf of the jv 
the level of future revenues from the jv will be dependent upon the extent of research and development services requested by the jv  the future financial position of the jv and the terms of a new services agreement  if any  or such other agreement of the members with respect to research and development services to be performed 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we currently have major research and development programs investigating symptom management and supportive care  human immunodeficiency virus related diseases hiv and cancer  for which we own or have licensed technology and collaborated with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic institutions 
in addition  we are conducting several smaller research projects in the areas of virology and cancer 
for various reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials and our dependence in certain instances on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete our research and development programs 
however  we expect to increase our spending on mntx to approximately million in for purchases of clinical supplies and clinical trials 
spending on other programs is expected to remain relatively constant in for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred were as follows see results of operations expenses 
back to contents years ended december  in million mntx hiv cancer other programs total we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
in september  we were awarded a contract by the national institutes of health the nih contract 
the nih contract provides for up to million in funding  subject to annual funding approvals  to us over five years for preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
our scientists will be the principal investigators under the contract and will head the vaccine development effort 
existing academic collaborators of ours will head the vaccine design and animal testing core groups under a subcontract 
a total of approximately million is earmarked under the nih contract to fund such subcontracts 
funding under this nih contract is subject to compliance with its terms  and the payment of an aggregate of million in fees is subject to achievement of specified milestones 
we believe that our existing capital resources together with revenue from currently approved government grants and contracts and revenue from the jv should be sufficient to fund operations at least through the first half of during the next months  we expect to expend substantial funds to conduct research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials and other related general and administrative activities 
our expenditures for these activities will include required payments under operating leases and licensing  collaboration and service agreements as noted in the table below 
for periods beyond months  we may seek additional financing to fund operations through future offerings of equity or debt securities or agreements with corporate partners and collaborators with respect to the development of our technologies 
we also plan to seek funding from additional grants and government contracts 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
we will require substantial funds to continue to conduct research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials and other general and administrative activities 
our expenditures for these activities will include required payments under operating leases and licensing  collaboration and service agreements as noted in the table below 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships with  or new relationships with  licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 

back to contents other than currently approved grants and contracts and revenue from services performed for the jv for  we have no committed external sources of capital and  as discussed above  we expect no significant product revenues in the near future 
the above are forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be changes that would consume our assets earlier than planned 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future operating lease payments  license and milestone payments for license and corporate collaboration agreements and our funding commitment to the jv for payments due by period total less than one year to years to years greater than years in millions operating leases license and collaboration agreements funding commitment to the jv for assumes attainment of milestones covered under each agreement 
the timing of the achievement of the related milestones is highly uncertain  and accordingly the actual timing of payments  if any  is likely to vary  perhaps significantly  relative to the timing contemplated by this table

critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development as we perform services  provided a contractual agreement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and our collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
in situations where we receive payment in advance of the performance of services  these amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as we perform the related services 
non refundable fees  including payments we receive for services  up front licensing fees and milestone payments are recognized as revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete and total expected contract revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue recognition of long term power sales contracts  which is a systematic method that is representative of the revenue earned or obligations fulfilled under these arrangements 
however  the revenue we recognize is limited to the amount of non refundable fees received 
non refundable fees that we receive in consideration for granting collaborators the right to license product candidates developed by us are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying agreements 
with regard to our revenues from non refundable fees  changes in estimates of our costs to complete could have a material impact on the revenues we recognize 
the company has been awarded government research grants and contracts from the national institutes of health the nih 
the nih grants and contracts are used to subsidize the company s research projects projects 
nih grant revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis as subsidized project costs are incurred 
such method approximates the straight line basis over the lives of the projects 
the nih contract awarded in september reimburses the company for costs associated with the preclinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
for the year ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively of grant and contract revenue 

back to contents in connection with the formation of the equally owned jv  we have funded the first million of research and development costs incurred on behalf of the jv 
prior to reaching million of such costs  we recognized reimbursements on a net basis and did not recognize any revenue from the jv 
subsequent to having funded million of research and development costs in the fourth quarter of  both members are required to fund the jv to support ongoing research and development efforts conducted by us on behalf of the jv 
accordingly  following million of funding  we recognized payments for research and development as revenue 
for the year ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively of contract research and development revenue for services performed on behalf of the jv 
a portion of these revenues was reimbursement for costs expended to third parties 
beginning in  all costs to third parties were paid directly by the jv 
the level of future revenues from the jv will be dependent upon the extent of research and development services requested by the jv  the future financial position of the jv and the extension  if any  and terms of an amended services agreement 
the level of commitment by progenics and cytogen to fund the jv is based on an annual budget that is approved by both members 
that budget is intended to be sufficient to fund research and development projects for the budget must also consider the ability of the members to fund the jv 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
we expect that clinical trial expenses will increase significantly in and as many clinical trials progress or are initiated in the mntx and hiv programs
