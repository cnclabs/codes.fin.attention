overview we design and sell application specific analog semiconductor products primarily for high volume applications in the mobile  computing and consumer electronics markets 
we are a leading supplier of application specific integrated passive asip devices that provide electromagnetic interference filtering  electrostatic discharge protection and termination for high speed signals 
we also offer a growing portfolio of active analog devices including power management and interface devices 
our asip devices  built using our proprietary silicon process technology  provide the function of multiple passive components in a single chip solution for densely populated  high performance electronic systems 
our asip devices are significantly smaller  offer increased performance and reliability  and cost our customers less  taking into account all of the costs of implementation  than traditional solutions based on discrete passive components 
some of our asip devices also integrate active analog elements to provide additional functionality 
with our active analog device portfolio  we seek opportunities to design standard products that are differentiated from competitive alternatives by being optimized for specific applications 
we also selectively design second source active analog devices that provide us entry to new applications  complement other products in our portfolio or enhance existing customer relationships 
our active analog device solutions use industry standard cmos manufacturing processes for cost effectiveness 
during the past three years  we have streamlined our operations and become fabless for the semiconductor products that we supply to our customers in our core markets  using independent providers of wafer fabrication services 
this decision to use independent foundries led us to close our fabrication facility in milpitas  california and consolidate our thin film manufacturing activities in tempe  arizona 
in connection with these actions  we reduced our workforce and wrote down the value of equipment  recording restructuring charges of approximately million in the year ended march  we took an additional charge of million in cost of sales in the year ended march  relating to several adjustments made during the year to further reduce our internal manufacturing infrastructure  which included workforce reductions and equipment sales and write downs 
during the past several years  we have also focused our marketing and sales on strategic customers in our three core markets 
as a part of this process  we have reduced the number of our actively marketed products from approximately  to approximately while at the same time increasing our unit shipments from less than million in the quarter ended march  to more than million in the quarter ended march  as a result of our decision to limit the number of products we actively market  we sent end of life notices to our customers and wrote down associated inventories 
in compliance with our inventory valuation policy  we have also written down inventories when our quantity on hand for a particular part is in excess of forecasted demand 
in fiscal  our inventory reserve provisions were million for end of life inventories and million for excess inventories  for a total of million 
in fiscal  our inventory reserve provisions were million 
table of contents for end of life inventories and million for excess inventories  for a total of million 
in fiscal  our inventory reserve provision was million for end of life inventories 
to the extent we subsequently sell some of this end of life or excess inventory  our gross margin benefits by revenue without any associated cost of sales 
during the past three fiscal years  we sold inventory that had previously been written down  as follows in fiscal  million  in fiscal  million  and in fiscal  million 
end customers for our semiconductor products are original equipment manufacturers including dell  hewlett packard  kyocera wireless  lg electronics  motorola  philips  samsung  sony and trigem 
we sell to some of these end customers through original design manufacturers  including appeal  arima  benq  compal  pantech and quanta  and contract electronics manufacturers  including celestica  foxconn and solectron 
we use a direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and a network of distributors to sell our semiconductor products 
we also manufacture a limited number of thin film products in our tempe  arizona fabrication facility  which we sell primarily to guidant for use in implantable defibrillators and pacemakers 
we operate in one operating segment and most of our assets are located in the united states 
our assets located outside the united states are comprised primarily of inventory or equipment used in manufacturing our products 
results of operations net sales 
net sales by market were as follows amounts in millions year ended march  mobile computing and consumer medical other net sales net sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions year ended march  amount of total amount of total amount of total china taiwan korea japan and other total asia pacific united states brazil and canada total americas europe total net sales 
table of contents our major customers were as follows year ended march  customers who each represented or more of our net sales guidant motorola guidant motorola guidant percentage of our net sales comprised by customers who each represented or more of our net sales distributors who each represented or more of our net sales epco epco epco fiscal versus net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or from of net sales in fiscal as shown above in the table of revenue by market  the largest component of this increase was in the mobile market followed by higher sales in the medical and computing and consumer electronics markets 
our growth in mobile sales is primarily the result of increasing our penetration of the mobile phone market and secondarily a result of market growth 
during fiscal  we announced that we had design wins at and are shipping products to samsung electronics in addition to motorola and lg electronics  who are among the top tier of handset manufacturers 
in addition to these top tier manufacturers  we also sell our products to a large number of other handset manufacturers 
the growth in the medical business is primarily the result of improved pricing  and secondarily additional demand from our primary medical products customer  guidant 
the growth in computing and consumer electronics is primarily the result of increased volume shipments to manufacturers of personal computers  digital displays and set top boxes 
our sales from other products  which include lighting  communications  legacy and mature products  declined during fiscal versus fiscal we had expected a decrease in sales of our communications  legacy and mature products as we had previously provided our customers for many of these products with end of life purchase opportunities 
we substantially completed shipment of end of life product orders during fiscal and therefore expect to recognize substantially lower sales of these products in the future 
in addition  price increases for our lighting products and other factors resulted in a significant reduction in orders for these products and we no longer expect these products to be a significant contributor to our sales in the future 
units shipped during fiscal increased to approximately million units from approximately million units for fiscal our increased net sales resulted primarily from larger unit sales  due in part from increased sales of current products and in part from sales of newly introduced products  and to a lesser extent  from price increases effective july   on our medical products 
our average unit price decreased by approximately during fiscal versus fiscal this decrease was predominately the result of faster growth in our lower priced products  which offset our medical product price increases 
fiscal versus net sales for fiscal were million compared to net sales for fiscal of million  an increase of million  or 
the largest component of this increase was in the mobile market followed by higher sales in the computing and consumer electronics and medical markets 
net sales in the mobile market  computing and consumer electronics and medical markets increased to million  million and million in fiscal from approximately million  million  and million respectively in fiscal 
table of contents sales in the lighting market increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while net sales in our communications  legacy and mature products in total decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we had expected a decrease in our communications  legacy and mature products as we have notified our customers that we will no longer support many of these products 
the customers for the affected products have been provided with end of life purchase opportunities 
units shipped during fiscal increased to approximately million units from million in fiscal our increased revenue resulted primarily from larger unit sales  which resulted in part from increased sales of current products and in part from sales of newly introduced products 
our average unit price dropped by approximately during fiscal versus fiscal which was predominately the result of faster growth in our lower price products and to a lesser extent to price decreases

fiscal versus over the past three years we have been implementing a strategy to satisfy the production requirements for products in our core markets from external foundries 
our requirements for complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos products or our proprietary process requirements can be run on standard manufacturing lines at our external foundries 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the final internal cmos wafer fabrication and converted our tempe manufacturing operations to a dedicated thin film facility 
our thin film products are primarily medical products plus a portion of our mature products  which are shown in the other products category in the net sales discussion 
during the year  we subcontracted our chip scale packaging requirements and eliminated our internal capability 
we were able to reduce our tempe related internal manufacturing overhead costs by approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of reducing headcount earlier in the year and further reducing headcount and converting the facility to thin film production only  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we substantially completed the realignment of our internal manufacturing operations  which we began several years ago 
as an ongoing requirement of our business  we expect to continuously optimize our operations in the future 
included in cost of sales for fiscal was approximately million of charges associated with changes to our internal manufacturing cost structure during the year 
the increase in cost of sales for fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to the greater volume of products sold  which accounted for an increase of approximately million 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million due to cost reductions including the realignment of and reduction in spending at our tempe wafer fabrication facility 

table of contents in fiscal  our inventory reserve provisions were million for end of life inventories and million for excess inventories  for a total of million 
in fiscal  our inventory reserve provisions were million for end of life inventories and million for excess inventories  for a total of million 
however  we benefited from the sale of previously reserved inventory due primarily to the large number of products for which we have discontinued future support by placing them in an end of life category 
these products have been primarily sold through our distributors to an erratic and unpredictable demand by end customers 
as a result  we have experienced the sale of some products that were previously reserved and the requirement to further write down certain other products for which orders did not occur as we had expected 
the benefit related to sales of previously reserved inventory was approximately million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
fiscal versus cost of sales decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal while the level of net sales increased by million 
cost of sales was impacted by three elements the charges related to our end of life eol or obsolete program  benefits of selling previously reserved material  and the costs of producing the products 
during fiscal  we initiated a plan to focus our business on high volume products and in markets where we believe we can achieve a leadership position 
we concluded that it was not economical to continue the manufacturing of many of our smaller and older product lines 
as part of this process  we designated many of these products as eol or obsolete during fiscal the last phase of eol or obsolete product designation  for that program  occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on our forecast of future demand and historical sales rates  and recognizing that minimal sales and marketing resources would be applied both internally and by our distributors for products so designated  much of the existing internal inventory for these legacy products was deemed to be excess or obsolete and accordingly was reserved  as well as the cost related to the inventory held by certain of our distributors 
during fiscal  we incurred charges of million related to reserving discontinued inventory on hand and at distributors 
during fiscal  we incurred charges of million related to reserving eol and obsolete inventory 
during fiscal and cost of sales included a benefit associated with the sale of fully reserved inventory for which reserves of approximately million and million had been established in prior periods 
cost of sales  excluding the impact of our end of life and obsolete product reserves and the benefits of selling previously reserved material  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal for an increase of million 
the small increase in cost of sales  excluding these items  relative to the increase in net sales of million is the result of streamlining our internal manufacturing operations and our strategy of outsourcing the wafer fabrication for the products we manufacture for our core markets 
gross margin 
gross margin is comprised of net sales less costs of sales 
the gross margin dollar increase and gross margin percentage increase in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily the result of increased sales volumes  a significant price increase for our medical products and a reduction in manufacturing spending 
the gross margin dollar and percentage increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was in part the result of increased revenue  consolidating our internal manufacturing operations  our wafer fabrication subcontracting strategy and the reduction in inventory charges related to our end of life eol or obsolete program as described above in cost of sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for employees  prototypes  masks and other expenses for the development of new products and process technology 
the increases in research and development expenses for fiscal versus were primarily due increased employee costs related to our bonus plan and an increase in prototype material expenses 
the decline in research and development expenses for fiscal versus was primarily due to lower employee compensation costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased during fiscal due to our increased sales 
in the future we expect to incur increased research and development expenses as sales increase and research and development to represent to of sales  however  if our sales were to decline in future periods  research and development could represent more than of sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for employees  sales commissions  marketing and promotional expenses  and legal and other professional fees 
the increases in selling  general  and administrative expenses for fiscal versus fiscal were primarily due to increases in marketing and finance staffing and increased expense for our bonus plan 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased during the fiscal year due to our increased sales 
these expenses are expected to increase in dollar terms in the future as sales increase  but at a slower rate than the growth in sales 
as a result  we expect a gradual reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the future  however  if our sales were to decline in future periods  these expenses could increase as a percentage of sales 
the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was primarily the result of lower compensation related expenses 
even though our revenue increased substantially in fiscal  thereby increasing our sales commissions  we were able to reduce our overall selling  general  and administrative expenses by in fiscal restructuring charges 
during fiscal  we completed a restructuring program that we initiated during fiscal the cost to implement the program was slightly less than originally projected and as a result we recognized a benefit related to the reversal of the remaining liability of  during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million related to our decision to outsource a significant portion of our wafer manufacturing 
in connection with this decision  we consolidated all of our internal wafer fabrication activities into our tempe  arizona facility 
during fiscal  we subcontracted our chip scale packaging requirements and eliminated our internal capability 
the million of restructuring charges in fiscal consisted of expenses related to a workforce reduction  write down of certain manufacturing equipment and lease termination costs 
other income and expense 
other income and expense  which is comprised primarily of interest expense and interest income  was a net expense of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal included in fiscal was a charge of  related to unamortized issuance costs associated with our industrial revenue bonds that we expensed when we prepaid these bonds in march for fiscal  as the result of our paying off most of our remaining debt in may and having more cash  we expect a net income rather than net expense 
income taxes 
in fiscal  and there was no provision for income taxes due to tax losses incurred during each of these periods 
in fiscal  despite our having earned net income on a financial accounting basis  we incurred a loss on a tax accounting basis primarily due to our having scrapped inventory during the fiscal year 
we have provided a valuation allowance against the total deferred tax assets due to the uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits of the carry forwards 
see note of notes to financial statements 
if we continue to be profitable in future periods  we may reverse a portion or all of our valuation allowance 
we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 
net income loss 
for the reasons explained above  we realized a net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to a net loss of approximately million for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial line items that are key indicators of our financial performance eg  revenue or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or customer acceptance  where applicable  has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to end user customers  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have return rights  is recognized upon title transfer and shipment  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
reserves for sales returns and allowances from end user customers are estimated primarily based on historical experience and are provided for at the time of shipment 
revenue from product shipments to distributors with agreements allowing for either price concessions or for product returns is recognized at the time the distributor sells the product to oems or other end users at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
revenue is not recognized upon initial shipment to the distributors since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
pursuant to our agreements with our distributors  custom  older or end of life products are sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions 
in these cases  revenue is recognized upon shipment to the distributor assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we defer our gross selling price of the product shipped and the related cost of the product shipped  and we reflect such net amounts on our balance sheet as a current liability entitled deferred margin on shipments to distributors 
thus  deferred margin on shipments to distributors represents the margin on the products we ship to distributors  or the difference between our revenue and cost of the product for inventory held by the distributors at the end of the accounting period 
determining whether collection is reasonably assured is the factor in our revenue recognition policy that involves significant judgement and estimates 
in making this determination  we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not probable  we defer recognition of revenue until the collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
inventory and related reserves our inventory and related reserves policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
forecasting customer demand is the factor in our inventory and related reserves policy that involves significant judgments and estimates 
in our inventory determination  we establish a reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on a comparison of quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand for the next twelve months 
in forecasting customer demand  we make estimates as to  among other things  the timing of sales  the mix of products sold to customers  the timing of design wins and related volume purchases by new and existing customers  and the timing of existing customers transition to new products 
because a significant portion of our sales are through distributors and many parts may have small sales volume  the customer demand forecast process does not include all parts 
therefore  historical trends may also be used in estimating the excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we review our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis considering all known facts and circumstances and adjust our forecast of customer demand accordingly 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
in fiscal  we wrote down inventory by million to reflect our estimates of excess and obsolete inventories 
also in fiscal  we recognized a benefit of approximately million relating to the sale of inventory that had been reserved in prior periods 
to the extent that our forecast of customer demand materially differs from actual demand  our estimates used in determining cost of sales and gross margin could be positively or negatively impacted 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets long lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss will be measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
in fiscal  we determined that the carrying value of certain of our owned manufacturing equipment was no longer recoverable based on estimates of future cash flows 
our estimate of the future cash flows generated from this equipment decreased significantly in due to our plan to outsource a significant portion of our wafer fabrication activities to independent foundries 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal estimates of future cash flows used to test the asset for recoverability were based on current operating projections extended to the useful life of the asset group 
we have estimated the fair value of the equipment based on market prices for purchases of similar equipment 
if the estimate of the cash flows were to increase by the assets would still not be recoverable 
there were no events or changes during fiscal that gave rise to the impairment of long lived assets 
litigation we are a party to lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including commercial and employment matters  which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
we review the current status of any pending or threatened proceedings with our outside counsel on a regular basis and  considering all the other known relevant facts and circumstances  we recognize any loss that we consider probable and estimable as of the balance sheet date 
for these purposes  we consider settlement offers we may make to be indicative of such a loss under certain circumstances 
during fiscal years   and  we had two pending cases in which significant damages were sought but it was difficult to determine the probability of loss and to estimate the resulting damages 
as a result  no accrual was made until we made settlement offers  at which time the amount we offered was accrued 
when these cases were settled during the first quarter of fiscal  the settlement had no income statement impact as the settlement amount had been fully accrued during prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through a combination of debt and equity financing and cash generated from operations 
total cash and cash equivalents as of march   were million  as compared to million at march  which did not include our restricted cash balance of  accounts receivable increased to million at march  compared to million a year earlier  primarily as a result of increased sales 
receivables days sales outstanding were days at march  as compared to days at march  inventories increased to million at march  from million at march  as a result of higher manufacturing activity levels necessary to support increased demand for our products 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the million increase was the result of a million bonus accrual along with a million increase in payables primarily related to the higher volume of contract manufacturing purchases associated with an increase in demand for our products 

table of contents operating activities provided million of cash in fiscal compared to usage of million in fiscal  due primarily to a swing to net income from a net loss and an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities  offset by an increase in inventories 
in fiscal the most significant usage of cash was our net loss before non cash charges of million  a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities and an increase in inventories together used million of cash 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in other long term assets  which provided approximately  of cash 
investing activities provided million of cash during fiscal which was the result of a reduction in restricted cash of  and proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of  offset by capital expenditures of  during fiscal  we used cash of million for investing which was principally the result of an increase in capital expenditures of million offset by the sale of short term investments of  net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal was the result of net proceeds from our private placement of common stock of million  proceeds from a new term loan from silicon valley bank of million  proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million and proceeds from the exercise of common stock warrants of million  offset by repayment of long term debt related to the industrial revenue bonds of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our common stock of million  proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million and million from long term borrowings offset by repayments of long term borrowings of million 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement agreement with silicon valley bank that allowed us to borrow up to a total of million under an equipment line of credit and a revolving line of credit 
on july   we entered into an agreement to modify the existing loan and security agreement 
the modification extended the term of the agreement for one additional year to july  and  subject to compliance with various covenants  allowed us to borrow an additional  under the equipment line of credit and an additional  under the working capital line of credit  still subject to a combined cap of million 
in january  we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement agreement with silicon valley bank that allows us to borrow up to a total of million  which includes a million term loan  an equipment line of credit and a revolving line of credit 
the term loan was to be used for general working capital purposes or to pay off indebtedness owing under the industrial revenue bonds related to our tempe facility  as described in note of notes to financial statements 
we used the term loan to pay off our industrial revenue bonds as discussed in the next paragraph 
the equipment line of credit has a maximum of million and is based on the amount of eligible equipment 
the revolving line of credit has a maximum of million and is based on accounts receivable 
as of march   million was outstanding under the term loan  million was outstanding on the equipment line of credit  and there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit 
on may  we repaid this debt 
we exercised our call option to repay the industrial revenue bonds on march   using million which we borrowed from silicon valley bank under a five year term loan pursuant to an amended and restated loan and security agreement 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of march  payments due by period in thousands total year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total on may   we used million of the million net proceeds from our recent public offering to repay our debt with silicon valley bank 
as of may   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  and debt and capital lease obligations of  this resulted in part from our follow on public offering that closed in early may in which we raised net proceeds of million which we used to pay down our term bank debt and bank equipment financing 
we had incurred this term debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal partly in order to pay off early the industrial revenue bonds associated with our tempe facility 
we still have in place a million working capital credit line which we have not drawn down 
in the future  it is possible that our liquidity could be impacted in order to resolve the environmental issue arising out of the closure of our milpitas wafer fabrication facility 
at present  we do not have a reasonable basis to assess the likelihood of potential future costs as to the environmental issues discussed in note of notes to financial statements 
we will be better positioned to evaluate whether we are reasonably likely to incur additional expenses to remediate the subject property once we obtain additional core samples and evaluate the risks associated with any contamination they may show 
at march  we had separate pending litigation with two former employees  tarsaim batra and chan desaigoudar  as described in note of notes to financial statements 
we resolved both matters in the first quarter of fiscal for amounts that had previously been accrued 
the payments during the first quarter of fiscal will have a minimal effect on our liquidity 
see note of notes to financial statements 
operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we maintain revenue  margins  inventory  accounts receivable and operating expenses 
we may wish to purchase additional production equipment to support a portion of the increases in capacity at our foundry and assembly test partners which may require additional equipment financing that we may not be able to obtain on terms we consider reasonable or may require us to use more of our cash resources than we currently have planned 
while we currently anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months  we may wish to raise additional equity capital  private or public  to provide us with cash reserves and to fund future growth such as to support the increased levels of receivables and inventory associated with any continued growth in revenue  or to make strategic technology or product line acquisitions 
in these regards  we have an effective s shelf registration statement covering million shares  however  we have only a few hundred thousand authorized but unissued shares that are not reserved for issuance upon the exercise of currently outstanding options 
we plan to solicit shareholder approval at our august annual shareholder meeting to increase our authorized common share capital by million shares  although there can be no assurance that the shareholders will approve this increase 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect upon our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital 
table of contents expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors  other than operating leases and purchase obligations shown above 
impact of inflation and changing prices although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on net sales or income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of march  we did not hold investments in debt or equity securities 
we have owned and may own financial instruments in the future that are sensitive to market risks and subject to fluctuations in interest rates as part of our investment portfolio 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
in prior years our investment portfolio did include debt instruments that were primarily united stated treasury and municipal bonds  high grade corporate bonds  and money market funds of less than one year in duration 
these investments were subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
our prior year investment portfolio consisted of certain commercial paper that was also subject to interest rate risk 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we had a material exposure to interest rate risk 
we have evaluated the estimated fair value of our financial instruments 
the amounts reported as cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term maturities 
historically  the fair values of short term investments are estimated based on quoted market prices 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our long term debt obligations and their fair value as of march  and our long term debt securities mature between one and a half years and five years from march  and between two years and fifteen years from march   respectively 
the fair value of our long term debt is based on the estimated market rate of interest for similar debt instruments with the same remaining maturities
