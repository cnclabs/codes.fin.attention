increased lending activity  coupled with increases in deposits and secondary market loan sales volume  fueled both the record earnings and balance sheet growth 
the company s net interest income for was  an increase of from the  reported for the net interest margin for was compared to reported for the company has been confronted with continuing net interest margin pressures due to the ultra low interest rate environment as well as elevated levels of loan prepayments and accelerated amortization of premiums on mortgage backed investment securities 
net amortization on the company s securities amounted to  for  an increase of  or  over the  reported for the company was able to offset the basis points reduction in the yield on total interest earning assets by reducing the cost of total interest bearing liabilities by basis points for during  management exercised a tight discipline in pricing on both loans and deposits 
the federal reserve bank s open market committee fomc met two times during the fourth quarter of at both meetings  the fomc kept the federal funds target rate stable at 
management expects a level federal funds target rate over the next several months and management does not expect an increase in this rate and  consequently  in market interest rates  until mid to late management revises its interest rate outlook from time to time based upon market conditions and other factors 
the company s non interest income represented of total revenues for compared to for the bank s non interest income for was  an increase of from the  reported for the primary force driving this increase was gain on sale of loans held for sale which amounted to  for compared to  for while the low interest rate environment pressured the bank s net interest margin through lower yields and increased premium amortization  it also fueled strong mortgage loan and refinance demand that resulted in the record level of gains on loan sales in the secondary market 
during  the bank originated  of loans that were sold in the secondary market compared to  in origination volume for management expects this volume level to remain steady as long as  among other things  market interest rates remain at the current levels and the economic outlook continues to be positive 

table of contents driven by commercial loan growth  the bank s loan portfolio increased in compared to at december   total loans outstanding reached  compared to  at december  asset quality remained strong in  as illustrated by the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans of in and in the allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans  covering over five times the balance of total nonperforming loans 
the bank s deposit base increased to total  at december  management priced deposit products to be competitive with other financial institutions with branch locations in its market 
management believes that the company has positioned itself for continued success with the combination of a strong capital base  a commitment to provide exceptional customer service  and a commitment to maintain the technology necessary to provide its customers with easy access to the financial products and services offered by the bank 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application is periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the central new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 
results of operations the company reported record earnings of  or per share diluted for the year ended december  compared to  or per share diluted in net income and diluted earnings per share grew and  respectively  in the company posted net income of  or per share diluted in net interest income net interest income  the company s largest and most significant component of operating income  is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and other earning assets  and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
this component represented of the company s net revenues in net interest income 
table of contents also depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following tables set forth the company s consolidated average balances of assets and liabilities and shareholders equity as well as interest income and expense on related items  and the company s average yield or rate for the years ended december     and the average rates are derived by dividing interest income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities  respectively

for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 

table of contents changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  related yields  and associated funding costs 
the rate volume table demonstrates the impact on net interest income of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
the company s net interest income totaled  in  an increase of from the  reported in as indicated in the rate volume table  the principal factor contributing to the increase in net interest income was an increase in the interest income of  resulting from increased balances in the loan portfolio components 
this was partially offset by decreases in both loan and investment securities yields due to the lower interest rate environment and the impact of accelerated premium amortization on mortgage backed securities during the company s net interest income totaled  in  an increase of from the  reported in as indicated in the rate volume table  the principal factor contributing to the increase in net interest income was a decrease in the interest expense of  resulting from decreased deposit and interest bearing liability market rates of interest

the bank s ratio of non interest expense to average assets was for compared to for and for an important industry productivity measure is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by net interest income and other income 
an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same or greater volume of income  while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources

non performing loans are composed of loans on a non accrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal payments but have not been classified as non accrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest on principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans varies by the type of loan involved 
generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loans totaled  at december   an increase of  from the  reported at december  the following table sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio by type for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  loan quality and ratios remain strong 
this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies

the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
management utilizes a systematic and documented allowance adequacy methodology for loan losses that requires specific allowance assessment for all loans  including real estate mortgages and consumer loans 
this methodology assigns reserves based upon credit risk ratings for all loans 
the reserves are based upon various factors  including historical performance and the current economic environment 
management continually reviews the process used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
allocations to the allowance for loan losses  both specific and general  are determined after this review 
loans are classified based on internal reviews and evaluations performed by the lending staff 
these evaluations are  in turn  examined by the bank s internal loan review specialist 
a formal loan review function  independent of loan origination  is used to identify and monitor risk classifications

table of contents liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
additional asset based liquidity is derived from scheduled loan repayments as well as investment repayments of principal and interest from mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side  the primary source of liquidity is the ability to generate core deposits 
short term borrowings are used as supplemental funding sources when growth in the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earnings assets 
the bank has established a borrowing relationship with the fhlb and its correspondent banks which further supports and enhances liquidity 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities

the securities portfolios are also a source of liquidity  providing cash flows from maturities and periodic repayments of principal 
during  prepayments and maturities of investment securities totaled  another source of liquidity is the loan portfolio  which provides a steady flow of payments and maturities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the largest component of the bank s total income is net interest income  and the majority of the bank s financial instruments are composed of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities with various terms and maturities 
the primary objective of management is to maximize net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is derived from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  loan prepayments  deposit withdrawals  and differences in lending and funding rates 
management actively seeks to monitor and control the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the bank s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity or repricing and the fair value of such instruments at december

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis to measure the impacts of longer term asset and liability mismatches beyond two years  the company utilizes modified duration of equity and economic value of portfolio equity evpe models 
the modified duration of equity measures the potential price risk of equity to changes in interest rates 
a longer modified duration of equity indicates a greater degree of risk to rising interest rates 
because of balance sheet optionality  an evpe analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows  with rates ranging up or down basis points 
the economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change 
results falling outside prescribed ranges require action by management 
at december  and  the company s variance in the economic value equity as a percentage of assets with an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift of basis points is within the negative guideline  as shown in the tables below 
the market capitalization of the company should not be equated to the evpe  which only deals with the valuation of balance sheet cash flows using conservative assumptions 
calculated core deposit premiums may be less than what is available in an outright sale 
the model does not consider potential premiums on floating rate loan sales  the impact of overhead expense  non interest income  taxes  industry market price multiples and other factors reflected in the market capitalization of a company
