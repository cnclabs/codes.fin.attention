except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
investors should carefully review the information contained in this report under the caption factors that may affect our future results and market price of our stock beginning on page overview we provide the contact center market an integrated performance optimization software suite that enables global enterprises to capture customer intelligence and optimize workforce performance 
our solution is comprised of business driven and or full time customer interaction recording  performance analysis and e learning management applications that are designed to enhance the quality of customer interactions across multiple communications media  including the telephone  e mail and the internet 
our software suite allows contact center management to share information gathered in the contact center with departments that touch the customer  as well as executives throughout the organization 
using an integrated business consulting  installation and training methodology  we provide services to support an effective and rapid deployment of our software that enables organizations to maximize their return on an investment in our products and services 
our software is designed to integrate with a variety of third party software applications  such as customer relationship management crm and enterprise resource planning applications  and with existing telephony and computer network hardware and software 
the majority of our customers are companies with an international presence and one or more contact centers that handle voice and data customer interactions for outbound sales and marketing operations  inbound service support lines  or both 
corporate spending for information technology it and crm applications contracted in and remained relatively flat in while the economic environment remains challenging  there were indications of an improving economic outlook and it spending showed signs of improvement during the second half of the international data corporation has predicted that it spending will increase by to in  and based upon our own analysis of the demand for our products and services  we have forecasted revenue growth in during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of eyretel plc eyretel  a united kingdom based provider of compliance and recording solutions for customer contact centers  for million 
we acquired eyretel with the intent to extend our presence in international markets and to expand our product line by adding a full time compliance recording software solution 
during  we successfully integrated the two companies in terms of product offerings and business operations 
we began consolidating eyretel s results on march   the date we assumed majority ownership of eyretel 
we derive product revenue by licensing software and derive services revenue by providing related installation  training  consulting  and maintenance services 
in  we also derived approximately million of product revenue by selling hardware to customers 
during and the first half of  the reduction in overall it spending limited our ability to grow product revenue 
however  in with the benefit of the eyretel acquisition  we grew product revenue by 
to date  equality balance and equality contactstore  our business driven and or full time customer interaction recording solutions  have generated the majority of our product revenue and will continue to do so in however  we believe we have additional product revenue growth opportunities in the following areas voice over internet protocol voip products as the movement from traditional telephony to internet protocol ip based communication systems in the contact center accelerates  new product offerings which include our performance analysis and e learning management applications  and new offerings that leverage our existing solution set marketed toward back office initiatives for business process monitoring 
factors that may influence our ability to grow our product revenue include our ability to remain competitive from a technology perspective  market acceptance of our new products  our ability to maintain our product pricing integrity  and our ability to expand our global sales channels we intend to maintain our competitive position from a technology perspective through the timely introduction of new products and platforms 
we believe our voip product offerings are a material growth opportunity as the market transitions to an ip technology environment 
in addition to growing our revenues by expanding our product lines  we also intend to grow our product revenue by expanding our global sales channels by continuing to enter into reseller  distributor and similar arrangements with key vendors in the contact center workforce optimization market 
during  of total product revenue was derived from the indirect sales channel  compared to in our services revenue has continued to increase over the past several years 
when our customers license our products  they generally purchase installation  training and one year of support services 
therefore  as we generate product revenue  we also generate these related services revenue 
in addition  our customers generally renew their maintenance contracts with us each year 
therefore  our maintenance revenue generally increases as our customer base increases 
factors that may influence our ability to grow our services revenue include the growth in product revenue and our ability to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction 
we are headquartered in roswell  georgia and have other offices throughout the united states 
we deliver our products and services internationally through our offices in australia  brazil  canada  china  germany  hong kong  japan  malaysia  mexico  singapore and the united kingdom 
during  and   and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from customers outside the united states 
we had full time employees at december   compared to at december  and at december  as of december   full time employees were located outside the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the collectibility of receivables  accounting for acquisitions  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary materially from expectations include  but are not limited to  lower than anticipated revenue growth from existing customers  our ability to attract new customers  our ability to grow through acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquisitions  the availability and cost of debt and equity financing  technology changes  or a decline in the financial stability of our customers 
negative developments in these or other risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenue is primarily derived from licensing software and providing related services including maintenance 
product revenue  which includes software and hardware  is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists to allocate revenue to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we recognize revenue using the residual method of accounting since our revenues are derived from customer orders that contain multiple element arrangements  including the sale of licensed software  hardware  maintenance  and professional services 
we generally have vsoe of fair value for maintenance and professional services  but not for the software and hardware elements of the order 
under the residual method  services revenue  including maintenance and professional services  is deferred at an amount equal to its fair value until those elements are delivered 
consequently  product revenue for the software and hardware may be recognized i upon delivery of those products when we have vsoe on the related maintenance and professional services sold and ii at an amount representing the difference between the total order amount and the amount deferred 
services revenue includes installation  training  consulting  maintenance and reimbursable travel expenses 
revenue from installation  training and consulting services is recognized upon performance of the related services and is offered and billed as separate elements of contracts 
reimbursable travel expenses revenue is recognized upon incurrence of the related expenses 
the functionality of the software and any hardware sold is not dependent on installation and training services 
maintenance is offered as a separate element and the majority of contracts include the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
maintenance revenue  which is generally billed in advance  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
specified upgrades are not typically offered to customers 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenues should be recognized in the current market environment 
we record provisions for estimated sales allowances on product and service related revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales and services allowances  analysis of customer credits and other known factors 
if future sales credits prove to be greater than the historical data and the estimates we used to calculate these provisions  our revenues could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the underlying receivables  our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and we believe appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot assure that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past or adequately predict future credit losses 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate and resulted in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional selling  general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
accounting for acquisitions 
accounting for acquisitions requires management to make judgments and estimates in determining the purchase price  the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and merger related and restructuring expenses 
in recording the eyretel acquisition in  management estimates primarily related to the following purchase price components or merger related restructuring costs valuation of deferred revenue  valuation of intangible assets and acquired in process research and development  lease termination costs and fair value estimates  severance expenses for employee terminations  contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition 
changes to purchase price estimates  prior to the completion of the final purchase price allocation  are reflected as an adjustment to intangible assets 
subsequent adjustments would be reflected in our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
all of our intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis 
useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed annually with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the determination of estimated future cash flows  however  requires management to make estimates 
future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in any given period 
impairment testing requires considerable analysis and judgment in determining the results 
if other assumptions and estimates were used in our evaluations  the results could differ significantly 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires companies to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december   we had net deferred tax liabilities primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and loss and credit carry forwards 
we continue to provide a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood of their realization 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including deferred tax liabilities that can be used to offset deferred tax assets  estimates of future taxable income of appropriate character within the carry forward period available under the tax law  and tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a tax benefit if it is estimated that future taxable income is likely 
once the deferred tax asset is realized through the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to future income  we would expect our provision for income taxes in future periods to reflect an effective tax rate significantly higher than past periods 
in addition  we have provided for potential tax liabilities due in foreign jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of conducting a global business enterprise  there are many transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transactions and arrangements made among related parties 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
stock based compensation 
with the exception of the deferred stock compensation that we recorded at our initial public offering  we generally do not record compensation expense for options granted to our employees because all options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
the pro forma disclosures of stock based compensation include the use of certain input factors in calculating the fair value of stock option grants  some of which require management to make estimates and use judgment 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board is exploring the possibility of modifying generally accepted accounting principles to require us to record stock based compensation expense in the future 
results of operations the table below shows operating data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue product services total revenue cost of revenue product services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development merger related and restructuring costs acquired in process research and development and related charges operating loss interest and other income  net loss income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income revenue total revenue increased in  as compared to  to million  due to increases in product and services revenue 
the number of installed customer sites grew to  sites at the end of  an increase from  sites at the end of total revenue increased in  as compared to  to million due to an increase in services revenue from the increased sites 
the number of installed customer sites grew to  sites at the end of from sites at the end of product revenue  which included software as well as hardware revenue in only  increased in  as compared to  to million  due to increased sales to our international markets and to the sales of hardware 
international revenue increased as a result of our acquisition of eyretel  which was based in the united kingdom and had a broader international presence than we previously had 
hardware revenue  which was derived exclusively from eyretel  was million in and none in and because hardware sales negatively impact our gross profit  we intend to continue to transition our customers to third party hardware suppliers and  as a result  expect hardware revenue to decline over time 
product revenue decreased in  as compared to  to million  due to fewer contracts signed by customers during  which we believe was attributable to a reduction in the level of corporate it spending  partially offset by our increase in the number of product offerings within our software product suite 
product revenue as a percentage of total revenue has been decreasing over the previous two years due to increased services revenue  as discussed below 
our product pricing has remained consistent over the previous three years 
product revenue derived from our indirect sales channel increased to in from in prior to  less than of our revenue was derived from our indirect sales channel 
this increase correlates to the increase in international revenue and to continually broadening our target market through the indirect channel 
during  and   and  respectively  of product revenue was attributable to new customers compared to follow on revenue from our existing customer base 
we receive follow on revenue from our customers when they purchase additional user licenses or license additional applications at existing sites and when they license our products at new sites 
we expect the proportion of new customer product revenue to increase in as we expect companies to increase their overall it spending 
services revenue  consisting of installation  training  consulting  maintenance revenue and reimbursable travel expenses  increased in  as compared to  to million 
our services revenue increased in primarily due to the services related to new product sales and to customer s renewing their maintenance contracts with us 
in addition  during we continued to experience growth in our business consulting offerings which help our customers better utilize the products they license 
maintenance revenue in reflects the reduction of eyretel s deferred maintenance revenue at the acquisition date to fair value as required by the purchase accounting rules 
the fair value of the maintenance contracts was less than the contract value paid by our customers for the underlying maintenance contracts 
we expect that our customers  upon renewing their maintenance contracts  will continue to pay an amount that is higher than the fair value as determined under the purchase accounting rules 
this will result in an increase in maintenance revenue as these contracts renew 
services revenue increased in  as compared to  to million due to growth in all areas of our services revenue 
installation  training and consulting revenue increased in due to overall increased services revenue per customer site and the addition of new consulting services offerings 
the growth in maintenance revenue in resulted from the growth in new customer sites under maintenance contracts and the increasing recurring maintenance revenue stream 
services revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in and due to the compounding effect of maintenance revenue from both new customer sites and renewals of maintenance contracts from existing customer sites and  to a lesser extent  from the increase in other services revenue 
we expect services revenue  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  to continue to increase over time due to the compounding effect of renewals of annual maintenance contracts from existing customer sites and increased business consulting services offered around our expanded product suite 
cost of revenue total cost of revenue increased to million in  as compared to  and to million in  as compared to expressed as a percent of revenue  gross profit margins decreased to in and in from in excluding hardware cost of sales  which was a new cost in due to the acquisition of eyretel  gross profit margin was in the decline in gross profit margin in was mainly attributable to the amortization of certain intangible assets resulting from the eyretel acquisition 
the decrease in gross profit margin in was attributable to a greater percentage of revenue in generated from services  which has a lower profit margin than product revenue 
we expect the decline in future hardware sales  the diminishing impact of the fair value adjustment to maintenance revenue  and the implementation of improved services methodologies will improve our gross profit margin in the near term 
however  we would also expect that these gross profit margin improvements would be offset as lower margin services revenue represents a greater percentage of our total revenue in the future 
cost of product revenue primarily consists of royalties due to third parties  amortization of acquired technology  hardware and packaging costs 
cost of product revenue increased to million in  as compared to  due to the cost of hardware in the amount of million and the amortization of intangible assets in the amount of million in  none of which existed in or we will continue to incur this amortization expense but expect the cost of hardware to decline as we reduce the amount of hardware sold 
cost of product revenue in increased  as compared to  to million due to license fees associated with third party software components that are embedded in our software applications 
as we develop upgrades of our existing products and add new offerings to our product suite we often embed third party technology into our software  which will increase the cost of product revenue in the future 
cost of services revenue for installation  training  consulting and maintenance services include personnel costs and related expenses and allocated overhead 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses and benefits 
cost of services revenue in increased  as compared to  to million due to an increase in the number of employees engaged in installation  training  consulting and customer maintenance services primarily due to the eyretel acquisition 
cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue increased to in from in this percentage increase was primarily due to the impact of the fair value adjustment to eyretel s deferred services revenue on the purchase date 
cost of services revenue increased  as compared to  to million in primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and contractors engaged in consulting and customer maintenance services 
cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue decreased to in from in this improvement was due primarily to the increased services revenue per customer site as well as improved methodologies in the consulting and maintenance services group  combined with an increase in consulting and maintenance revenue 
we expect that the cost of services revenue  as a percentage of services revenue  will decrease as the impact of eyretel s fair market adjustment decreases and as renewal maintenance revenue is reflected in income at the actual invoice amount  rather than the lower amount recorded due to purchase accounting requirements 
in addition  we anticipate that our services margins will improve due to the services methodology being implemented throughout our entire international organization during we expect our customer service organization to continue to grow over time and  therefore  we anticipate that our cost of services revenue  in absolute dollars  will increase as we grow our customer base 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs  provisions for bad debt expense  and the amortization of certain intangible assets 
sg a expense increased in to million due to the increased size of our company after the eyretel acquisition and due to million of amortization of acquired intangible assets 
bad debt expense also increased by million in  as compared to  primarily due to an increase in exposure from international receivables 
as the percentage of our international revenue increases  we expect our bad debt expense to also increase 
sg a expense remained fairly constant in  as compared to  at million  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue due to a reduction in certain discretionary marketing spending  certain cost saving measures implemented during and a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense in resulting from collections in that were significantly reserved for during we expect sg a expense to remain relatively constant in the near future as some additional operating efficiencies will be offset by an increase in internal and third party costs associated with compliance with the rules and regulations of the sarbanes oxley act of research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of personnel and consulting costs to support product development  and allocated overhead 
r d costs are generally expensed as incurred 
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
historically  software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established have not been material and  therefore  have been charged to expense 
during  we capitalized million of third party costs in connection with the adaptation of existing products and technologies for new applications 
r d expenses increased  as compared to  to million in and  as compared to  to million in due primarily to an increased number of employees and consultants engaged in research and development activities 
we anticipate r d expenses to remain constant in as compared to merger related and restructuring costs 
we incurred merger related and restructuring costs of million during these merger related costs included million for a sterling based forward exchange contract to hedge the dollar cost of the acquisition  million of expenses related to integrating eyretel s software products  training personnel on products acquired and consolidating the operations of eyretel with the company  million of facilities costs to consolidate witness facilities  million of expenses related to employee severance and benefits  and million relating to the partial accrual of a bonus payable to eyretel s former chief executive officer  now our chief operating officer coo 
our board of directors agreed to pay a bonus of million or million as of december  to our coo in connection with the eyretel acquisition and subsequent integration 
this bonus is payable in two installments due march and march but may be payable in advance of these dates under certain circumstances  such as a change of control 
we expect merger related activities to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of however  we will continue to accrue the coo bonus over the related service period through the first quarter of acquired in process research and development and related charges 
in  we estimated that million of the purchase price of eyretel represented acquired in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  these amounts were immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisition 
the value of the ipr d was calculated with the assistance of an independent third party by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies and taking into consideration stage of completion  complexity of work to date and to complete  anticipated product development and introduction schedules  forecasted product sales cycles  internal and external risk factors  revenue and operating expense estimates  contributory asset charges  and costs already incurred and the expected costs to complete 
during  we recorded charges totaling million for ipr d acquired from various third parties 
at the date of these transactions  the acquired ipr d technologies had not progressed to a stage where they met technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
at the time of each transaction  we estimated the stage of completion of the project and the time and resources required to complete the project by creating a product design plan and evaluating the progress of the acquired technology towards this plan 
a significant amount of uncertainty existed as to our ability to complete the development projects within a timeframe acceptable to the market  and failure to do so would have caused our competitive position in the market to erode 
additionally  the amount of development required to enable the acquired technology to integrate with our primary product was estimated to be significant  which increased the uncertainty surrounding its successful development 
these projects were successfully completed by june  interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on funds available for investment  net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
interest and other income  net decreased  as compared to  to million in due to lower yields and lower investment balances as a result of the acquisition of eyretel which was paid for in cash 
interest and other income  net decreased  as compared to  to million in due to lower yields 
we expect that interest and other income  net will increase slightly in in concert with interest rates 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for foreign income tax in  a provision for federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax in  and a provision for state income tax  federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax in deferred tax assets are normally recognized for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets generated as a result of net operating loss carryforwards aggregating million for us tax purposes and million for foreign tax purposes at december   as the future realization of the tax benefits is not currently considered more likely than not 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the last eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as the percentage of total revenue represented by each item 
the information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider to be necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

product revenue includes hardware sales of million  million and million in the fourth  third and second quarters of  respectively 
during and much of  we believe product revenue was affected by a reduction in the level of corporate it spending 
services revenue  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue  generally increased during and due to the compounding effect of maintenance renewals and the expansion of our service offerings 
we expect that services revenue will continue to grow relative to license revenue throughout gross profit margins decreased from quarter to quarter due to hardware costs and amortization of intangibles in  as well as the increased percentage of total revenue derived from services in and total operating expenses in  excluding merger related and restructuring costs and acquired ipr d  decreased as a percentage of total revenue  as we were able to realize planned synergies from the eyretel acquisition in addition to implementing certain cost saving measures throughout the year 
our quarterly operating results  particularly product revenues  have experienced significant fluctuations in the past and we expect that this pattern will continue in the future 
for instance  quarterly results may fluctuate based on the timing of sales due to customer calendar year budgeting cycles  slow summer purchasing patterns and compensation policies that tend to compensate sales personnel  typically in the latter half of the year  for achieving annual quotas 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results are not necessarily meaningful  and such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources we used million in cash from operating activities in  which was largely due to costs associated with our acquisition of eyretel 
we paid million of the million in merger related and restructuring costs during in  we expect to pay approximately million in additional accrued merger related and restructuring costs 
following the acquisition  our accounts receivable from international customers increased significantly 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso increased from days at december  to days at december  we expect our dso to remain in the mid s range in the future as we derive a greater proportion of our revenue from international operations  where payment is typically slower than in the united states 
we generated million in cash flows from operating activities in compared to cash used in operating activities of million in this increase in cash flow from operations in was due primarily to the collection of accounts receivable and a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
net cash flows used in investing activities in was million which included the acquisition of eyretel for million net of million in cash held by eyretel and certain other assets purchased for million from a software and services company focused on the business intelligence marketplace 
in addition  in cash was provided by the sale of investments securities of million to initially fund the eyretel acquisition  while million has since been reinvested 
net cash flows provided by investing activities was million in compared to cash used in investing activities of million in this increase was primarily due to the release of our restricted cash in and the purchase of ipr d in capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  were primarily for computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash flows provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
generally  since  funds have been provided by the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
in and continuing into the first quarter of  we repurchased million of our common stock 
up to million of stock repurchases have been authorized  but we do not currently anticipate making any further repurchases at this time 
at december   we had million in total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million in working capital 
in addition  we had million available under a line of credit  which was net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit secure the lease on the corporate headquarters facility and have decreasing schedules that ultimately expire in at our election  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate  or libor plus basis points and are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined by the agreement 
the revolving line of credit is secured by all of our assets and requires compliance with various covenants  including liquidity ratios and tangible net worth requirements  among others 
in may  we amended the amount of our tangible net worth requirement due to the effect of the eyretel acquisition 
we currently expect to have total capital expenditures of approximately million in we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase over the next several years as we expand our facilities and acquire equipment to support the expansion of our research and development activities and internal management information systems 
we anticipate that operating expenses and capital expenditures will continue to be a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
excess cash and investments  plus the availability under our line of credit  may be used to fund future merger or acquisition transactions 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish new financing arrangements 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure that any financing arrangements will be available in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
except for the hedge transaction entered into in connection with the eyretel acquisition  we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
during  due to the relative strength of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar  foreign currency translations contributed million to our december  cash balance as a result of our subsidiaries cash denominated in foreign currencies 
as of december  and  foreign currencies impacted cash by million in each year 
the majority of our operations have historically been in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  with the acquisition of eyretel and along with our existing foreign based operations  where transactions may be denominated in foreign currencies  we are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have offices in australia  brazil  canada  china  germany  hong kong  japan  malaysia  mexico  singapore and the united kingdom and conduct transactions in either the local currency of the location or us dollars 
we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes 
historically  these risks have been minimal  but as our international operations continue to grow  adverse currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were million   and million in  and  respectively 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
our investments are made with capital preservation and liquidity as our primary objectives 
we generally hold only high grade investments such as commercial paper  corporate bonds and us government agency securities to maturity 
to reduce our balance sheet exposure to variations in asset values  our investment policy guidelines specify that we invest in the highest investment grade securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of nine months for our entire portfolio 
our investment portfolio may contain securities with maturities of up to three years 
while this minimizes our interest rate risk to asset values  our results are exposed to fluctuations in interest income due to changes in market rates 
in order to acquire the shares of eyretel  we converted our investment portfolio to cash in february  realizing a gain of million 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our contractual cash obligations associated with lease obligations  operational restructuring and merger related costs are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations     acquisition related commitments    total      as of december   we did not have any other contractual commitments or off balance sheet arrangements 
transactions with related parties tom crotty  a member of our board of directors  is a managing member of battery partners iv llc  the general partner of battery ventures iv  and a managing member of battery partners vi llc  the general partner of battery ventures vi 
battery ventures iv held more than of our stock at december  and holds less than of our stock at the date of this report 
our chief executive officer ceo is a limited partner in battery ventures vi  lp during  notes receivable due from certain officers totaling million were satisfied by delivering  at current fair market value  shares of our common stock  which such employees had held for longer than six months 
in february  the notes receivable from our ceo totaling million were refinanced in part with a full recourse note the note for approximately million with floating monthly interest of basis points over the federal funds rate 
the note was payable in three equal payments of principal and interest due annually through february the balance was satisfied in full during by the ceo delivering either cash or  at current fair market value  shares of our common stock  which he had held for more than six months

factors that may affect our future results and market price of our stock 
our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future  and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including  but not limited to  the specific risks identified below 
inevitably  some investors in our securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell our securities 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report and the other documents we file with the sec 
important factors currently known to our management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include disclosures contained in this report and the other documents we file with the sec  as well as the following risks our products have a long sales cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results 
although it typically takes three to nine months from the time we qualify a sales lead until we sign a contract with the customer  we occasionally experience a longer sales cycle 
we expect that this will continue to be the case in future periods 
it is therefore difficult to predict the quarter in which a particular sale will occur 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens for one or more large orders or a significant number of small orders  it would delay the timing of our revenue  but not the timing of our corresponding expenditures 
lengthening our sales cycle could also increase the total cost of a sale due to additional employment costs allocable to the sale 
this could harm our ability to meet investor expectations for a given quarter 
our customers decisions regarding their purchase of our products and services is relatively long due to several factors  including the complex nature of our products  our need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products  competition for a shrinking amount of corporate resources because of general economic conditions  the investment of financial and other resources required by customers to purchase and implement our products  customers budget cycles and operating activities  which affect the timing of their purchases  the competitive evaluation and internal approval process many of our customers undertake before purchasing our products and services  and delayed purchases due to announcements or planned introductions of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors 
if the market in which we sell our products and services deteriorates as a result of adverse economic conditions  it will have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the market for customer relationship management software  including software that records and analyzes customer interactions  is still emerging 
our success depends on the use and acceptance of our software and services by existing and prospective customers 
in addition  demand for our software remains uncertain because our existing and potential customers may not understand the benefits of using customer relationship management software generally or  more specifically  software which records and analyzes the interactions between a business and its customers  not achieve favorable results using our software  experience technical difficulty in implementing our software  use alternative methods such as online self help to solve the same business problems our software is intended to address  or close contact centers 
we may continue to experience losses from operations in the future 
with the exception of the first and second quarters of  in which we achieved a quarterly operating profit  we have experienced quarterly losses from operations 
we incurred losses in  the third and fourth quarters of and substantial losses before we may continue to suffer losses in the future 
as a result of our operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  in addition  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  professional services  and sales and marketing activities 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability in any future period 
if we do not achieve profitability from operations  or if we do not remain profitable  we may need to obtain additional financing 
any needed financing may not be available to us from sources upon which we have historically relied  or from any source  on acceptable terms  if at all 
once profitability is achieved  if we fail to remain profitable  it will materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock 
our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results are difficult to predict and could vary significantly from period to period 
in particular  we typically derive a significant portion of our software product revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders 
a delay in the recognition of revenue from one of these orders may cause our results of operations during a quarter to be lower than we or investors expect 
the delay or failure to close anticipated sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenue in that quarter and subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale could be recognized 
in addition  because our revenue from installation  maintenance and training services largely correlates with our product revenue  a decline in product revenue could also cause a decline in our services revenue in the same quarter or in subsequent quarters 
our revenue  expenses and operating results may vary significantly in response to the risk factors described in this section  as well as the following factors  some of which are beyond our control a decrease in demand for our software  or more generally  for products that record and analyze the interactions between a business and its customers and or provide electronic learning  due to either purchasing trends or general economic conditions  announcements or introductions of new products and services by our competitors  pricing for competitive products  the timely payment of fees due to us by our customers  our ability to develop  market and manage new software  software enhancements and services that our customers require in a timely manner  the deferral of orders for our software or delays in the installation of our software from one quarter to a later quarter  our ability to successfully complete the integration of the business and operations of eyretel plc and any other businesses we may acquire in the future  our ability to sell eyretel s software products  and successfully transitioning the sale and services of eyretel s related hardware products to an independent third party provider  the amount of financial resources we have to spend to improve our software  services and operations  delays in installations of our software  the increasing length of sales and implementation cycles for our software  the mix of revenue generated by software product licenses and related services  spending limitations imposed on our customers or potential customers because of changes in their business  financial condition and outlook  general economic conditions and decreased capital spending budgets  including limitations imposed after the sales cycle has begun but before a sale is consummated  the timing and size of our capital expenditures and changes in our working capital  the failure of our customers to renew their annual maintenance  either because they consolidate their contact centers or they stop using our product company wide  the economic conditions of the companies within the financial services and telecommunications industry verticals into which we have historically sold  and expect to continue to sell  our software  the ability of our reseller partners to successfully resell our software  and our ability to sell our products in new geographic markets 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance  and you should not rely on them to predict our future performance or the future performance of our stock price 
if our future revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
if we fail to manage and expand our international operations  we may be unable to reach or maintain our desired levels of revenue or profitability 
we derived million  million and million in  and  respectively  from customers outside the united states  principally in the united kingdom  continental europe  hong kong greater china  canada  singapore  japan  australia  brazil  india and mexico 
during  we completed the purchase of eyretel 
through this acquisition  we significantly expanded our operations outside of north america 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations through additional acquisitions  internal business expansion and strategic business relationships 
our operations outside of the united states at december  consisted of dedicated employees located in australia  brazil  canada  china  germany  hong kong  japan  malaysia  mexico  singapore and the united kingdom 
we have also established relationships with a number of international resellers 
we intend to continue to analyze opportunities to expand our operations into other international markets 
our plans to expand internationally and our operations in new markets may be adversely affected by a number of risks  including limited development of an international market for our software and services  expanding and training our international sales force and support operations  expenses associated with customizing products for multiple countries  political and economic instability  potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in foreign countries  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  and multiple  conflicting and changing laws and regulations governing intellectual property  call monitoring and the recording of employees and customers 
as we further expand our operations outside the united states  we will also face new competitors and competitive environments 
in addition to the risks associated with our domestic competitors  foreign competitors may pose an even greater risk  as they may possess a better understanding of their local markets and better working relationships with local infrastructure providers and others 
in particular  because telephone protocols and standards are unique to each country  local competitors will have more experience with  and may have a competitive advantage in  these markets 
we may not be able to obtain similar levels of local knowledge or similar relationships in foreign markets  which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing local language versions of our products or in marketing our products to international customers 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell  and deliver our products internationally 
if we do not continue to expand the distribution of our products through direct and indirect sales channels  we may be unable to expand our market share or increase our revenue 
to expand our market share and revenue  attract new customers and increase sales to existing customers  we may need to expand our direct sales force by hiring additional sales personnel and management and increase the number of relationships we have with companies that provide us with customer referrals or leads for new business 
historically  it has taken us up to six months to train new sales personnel before they reach an acceptable level of productivity 
we have also experienced difficulty in finding new sales personnel with experience in computer and telephone integration technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to find an adequate number of new sales personnel meeting our specific needs 
if the personnel we hire are less qualified than we expect  it may take us more time to train them before they reach an acceptable level of productivity  which could increase our costs and delay our expansion efforts 
we have increased the amount of revenue from our indirect sales channel by increasing the number and scope of relationships with companies that resell our software 
product revenue from our indirect sales channel  which consists of select resellers and a variety of strategic marketing alliances  accounted for approximately and of total product revenue in and  respectively 
we expect revenue from our indirect sales channel and  accordingly  our dependence on resellers and strategic marketing alliances  to continue to increase as we establish more relationships with companies to resell our software worldwide 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain productive relationships with our current partners  or that we will be able to establish similar relationships with additional resellers on a timely basis  or at all 
in addition  we cannot be certain that these distribution partners will devote adequate resources to selling our software and services 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  we will not be able to maintain this revenue source and our business will suffer 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results 
we may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates for which hedging activities may not adequately protect us 
moreover  exchange rate risks can have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products in foreign markets 
where we sell our products in us dollars  our sales could be affected adversely by declines in foreign currencies relative to the dollar  thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies 
where we sell our products in local currencies  we could be competitively unable to increase our prices to reflect fluctuations in the exchange rates 
we cannot predict accurately the impact that future exchange rate fluctuations may have on our results 
we face intense competition that could adversely affect our revenue  profitability and market share 
the market for products that record customer interactions  analyze performance and or provide electronic learning is intensely competitive  evolving and is subject to rapid changes in technology 
we believe our principal competitors include  but are not limited to quality monitoring suppliers to the contact center industry  traditional call logging vendors  electronic learning vendors  business analytics vendors  large telecom solution providers  systems integrators and consulting firms  and new  larger and more established entities that may acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with providers of recording or performance enhancing software solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  more established business relationships  larger customer bases  a broader range of products and services  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  personnel  management  service  support and other resources than we do 
as a result  our current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take better advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities  devote greater resources to marketing and selling their products and services and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
these competitors may distinguish themselves from us on the basis of their longer operating histories and ability to withstand difficult economic conditions 
our competitors may also be able to offer products at lower prices or with other incentives that we cannot match 
in addition  many of our competitors market their products through resellers and companies that integrate their technology and products with those of the competitor 
these resellers and technology partners of our competitors often have strong business relationships with our customers and potential customers 
for example  some of our competitors have better and more long standing relationships with telephone switch vendors 
our competitors may use these business relationships to market and sell their products and compete for customers with us 
in addition  our competitors may offer or develop products and services that are superior to ours 
it is also possible that resellers or technology partners  such as certain telephone switch vendors  may acquire one or more of our competitors  which would further solidify their business relationships 
we have developed  and intend to continue to develop  relationships with companies that resell our software and companies that provide us with customer referrals or leads  some of which may become competitors 
we engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with our resellers  and rely on them for recommendations of our software during the evaluation stage of the purchase process 
when we enter into agreements with resellers  the agreements are not exclusive and may ordinarily be terminated by either party 
some of the resellers have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors  and may recommend the products and services of our competitors to customers instead of our software and services 
in addition  through their relationships with us  the resellers could learn about our software and the market for our software and services and could develop and sell competing products and services 
as a result  our relationships with resellers could lead to increased competition for us 
we expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our market and as new products  services and technologies are introduced 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins and loss of our market share  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely heavily on sales of our equality balance  equality evaluation and equality contactstore products 
our financial performance has depended  and will continue to depend  on our ability to develop and maintain market acceptance of our equality balance  equality evaluation and equality contactstore products and new and enhanced versions of them 
historically  most of our product revenue has been derived from the sale of our equality balance and equality evaluation software  and most of eyretel s product revenue was derived from the sale of equality contactstore 
we expect revenue from these products to continue to account for most of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors that adversely affect the pricing of or demand for these products  such as competitive pressures  technological change or evolution in customer preferences  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of these factors are beyond our control and difficult to predict 
if we fail to develop new software or improve our existing software to meet or adapt to the changing needs and standards of our target market  sales of our software and services may decline 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and introduce new software and software enhancements which meet the needs of companies seeking to record and analyze their interactions with customers and or deliver electronic learning to their employees 
to achieve increased market acceptance of our software and services  we must  among other things  continue to improve our existing software and introduce new software solutions  incorporate new technology into our software and services on a timely and cost effective basis  keep pace with the products and services of our competitors  satisfy the changing requirements of our current and potential customers  improve the effectiveness of our software  particularly in installations involving very large databases with a significant number of simultaneous users  enhance our software s ease of administration  improve our software s ability to extract data from existing software systems  and adapt to rapidly changing computer operating system  database and software platform standards and internet technology 
substantial product development expenditures and product planning are required to keep pace and ensure compatibility with new technology in our industry 
if we fail to develop and introduce new software and enhancements for our existing software  our software and services may not achieve market acceptance and we may be unable to attract new customers 
our products may fail to perform properly and contain defects  which may cause us to incur additional expenses or result in the loss of customers 
our software is used in a complex operating environment that requires its integration with computer and telephone networks and other business software applications 
furthermore  the hardware  software and network systems generally used in conjunction with our software  particularly telephone standards and protocols  change rapidly 
the evolution of these standards may cause our products to function slowly or improperly 
poor product performance may necessitate redevelopment of our product or other costly reengineering measures which may divert our management and product development resources and funds 
due to the large number of  and variations in  computer and telephone network systems and applications  as well as the rapid changes in these products  our testing process may be unable to duplicate all possible environments in which our software is expected to perform 
any errors or defects that are discovered after we release new or enhanced software could cause us to lose revenue and customers  delay the market acceptance of our software  damage our customer relationships and reputation and increase our service and warranty costs 
all of these problems could be exacerbated as we move our products to the latest software technologies and platforms 
if our advanced compliance recording applications fail to record of our customers interactions  we may be subject to liability and our reputation may be harmed 
through our acquisition of eyretel  we have extended our performance optimization suite to include advanced compliance recording applications and related services 
many of our customers acquired through the eyretel acquisition use these applications to record and store recordings of interactions to provide back up and verification of transactions and to guard against risks posed by lost or misinterpreted voice communications 
these customers rely on our applications to record  store and retrieve voice data in a timely  reliable and efficient manner 
if our applications fail to record of our customers interactions or our customers are unable to retrieve the recordings when necessary  we may be subject to liability and our reputation may be harmed 
although we attempt to limit any potential exposure through our license agreements for these applications  we cannot guarantee that we will eliminate or successfully limit our liability for any failure of our applications 
if we are unable to maintain the security of our systems  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
the occurrence or perception of security breaches in the operation of our business or by third parties using our products could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our customers use our products to compile and analyze highly sensitive or confidential information 
we may come into contact with such information or data when we perform support or maintenance functions for our customers 
while we have internal policies and procedures for employees in connection with performing these functions  the perception that any of our employees has improperly handled sensitive information of a customer or a customer s customer could negatively impact our business 
if  in handling this information  we fail to comply with our privacy policies or privacy and security laws  we could incur civil liability to government agencies  customers and individuals whose privacy is compromised 
if personal information is received or used from sources outside the us  we could be subject to civil  administrative or criminal liability under the laws of other countries 
in addition  while we implement sophisticated security measures  third parties may attempt to breach our security or inappropriately use our products through computer viruses  electronic break ins and other disruptions 
if successful  confidential information  including passwords  financial information  or other personal information may be improperly obtained and we may be subject to lawsuits and other liability 
any internal or external security breaches could harm our reputation  and even the perception of security risks  whether or not valid  could inhibit market acceptance of our products 
certain of our contracts contain provisions that are unfavorable to us 
certain of our contracts contain provisions that expose us to risks of loss that  in some cases  are not limited to amounts received under those contracts 
if we fail to perform to the standards required by these contracts  we could be subject to additional liability and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  third parties may use our technology for their own benefit 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the legal protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
these measures may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights  and we cannot be certain that third parties will not misappropriate our technology and use it for their own benefit 
also  most of these protections do not preclude our competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features substantially equivalent or superior to our software 
any failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as of december   we had six registered trademarks  three patents and patent applications pending in the u 
s and six patent applications pending internationally 
there is no guarantee that our pending applications will result in issued patents or  if issued  that they will provide us with any competitive advantages 
we cannot assure you that we will file further patent or trademark applications  that any future applications will be approved  that any existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights will adequately protect our intellectual property or that any existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights will not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  one or more of our existing or future patents  trademarks or copyrights may be found to be invalid or unenforceable 
we are aware of certain uses  us trademark registrations  and us trademark applications for our equality trademark and its variations that predate our use  and the april issuance of the us registration for our trademark equality 
it is possible that the owner of legal rights resulting from one or more of these prior uses  us trademark registrations  or us trademark applications will bring legal action to challenge our registration of and or our continued use of the trademark equality  and may also seek compensation for damages resulting from our use of our registered trademark if such challenging party prevails on such a claim 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our registration of this trademark will be undisturbed  or that this use will not result in liability for trademark infringement  trademark dilution  and or unfair competition 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology as compared to the laws of the united states 
if we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  would likely divert valuable management and product development resources and could involve a high degree of risk  regardless of whether we win or lose the litigation 
claims by other companies that our software infringes their intellectual property could require us to incur substantial expenses or prevent us from selling our software or services 
if any of our software violates the intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to reengineer or redevelop our software  seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering our software without substantial reengineering  or conduct studies of such intellectual property rights so as to evaluate whether such intellectual property rights are valid or enforceable 
any efforts to reengineer our software or obtain licenses from third parties may not be successful  could be extremely costly and would likely divert valuable management and product development resources 
our efforts to study the intellectual property rights of third parties may not be successful and could reveal that such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable  could be extremely costly and would likely divert valuable management and product development resources 
for example  depending on the outcome of our lawsuit against knowlagent as described under the heading legal proceedings  we may be required to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms  to stop selling or redesign our equality now application  or to pay damages or satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers 
in addition  in the rapidly developing technological environment in which we operate  third parties may have filed a number of patent applications  many of which are confidential when filed 
if our software is found to violate these patents when they are issued or any other intellectual property of others  we may become subject to claims for infringement 
an infringement claim against us could result in the loss of our proprietary rights and  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or require us to pay damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements on terms that are unfavorable to us  if such agreements are available at all 
in addition  our customers and other users of our software may become subject to claims if the software they license from us is alleged to infringe the intellectual property of others 
our customers and these other users of our software would likely attempt to hold us responsible for these claims and any resulting harm they suffer 
if we decide to  or are forced to  litigate any of these claims  the litigation could be expensive and time consuming  could divert our management s attention from other matters  and could otherwise materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
litigation and intellectual property claims against us could also disrupt our sale of software 
we expect that we and other participants in our industry and related industries will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of competitors with patent and other intellectual property portfolios in these industries grows 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and we cannot assure you that necessary licenses or similar arrangements will be made available to us on a reasonable basis or at all 
consequently  if we become subject to an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or we fail to obtain necessary licenses  we could be prevented from producing and selling some or potentially all of the components of our software 
such a result would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our future success also depends upon the continued compatibility of our software with the products and other technologies offered by other software and hardware companies 
our software must integrate with software and hardware solutions provided by a number of our existing and potential competitors 
these competitors or their business partners could alter their products so that our software no longer integrates well with them  or they could delay or deny our access to software releases that allow us to timely adapt our software to integrate with their products 
they could thus effectively prevent us from modifying our software to keep pace with the changing technology of their products 
if we cannot adapt our software to changes in our competitors technology  it may significantly impair our ability to compete effectively  particularly if our software must integrate with the software and hardware solutions of our competitors 
new products may not be compatible with our software  but may be compatible with the products of our competitors 
for example  our products must integrate with phone switches made by the telephone switch vendors and computer telephony software applications offered by other software providers 
if our products are not compatible with the new technologies offered by other software and hardware companies  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our professional services employees do not provide installation services effectively and according to schedule  our customers may not use our installation services or may stop using our software 
our customers ordinarily purchase installation  training and maintenance services  which they typically obtain from our professional services organization 
we generate a material part of our total revenues from the provision of these services 
because our software must be installed to work with a number of computer and telephone network systems  installation of our software can be complex 
these systems vary greatly from one customer site to another  and the versions and integration requirements of these third party systems change frequently 
we believe that the speed and quality of installation services are competitive factors in our industry 
if our installation services are not satisfactory to our customers  the customers may choose not to use our installation services to install our software 
in addition  these customers may determine that they will not license our software and instead will use the products and services of one of our competitors 
if this happens  we would lose licensing and services revenue from these customers  and it would likely harm our reputation in the industry in which we compete 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may make acquisitions or investments that are not successful and that adversely affect our ongoing operations 
we may acquire or make investments in companies  products  services and technologies which we believe complement our software and services 
because of the increasing use of new customer interaction media such as the internet and e mail  we believe that it may be important for us to acquire complementary technology to quickly bring new products to market 
we have limited experience in making acquisitions and investments 
as a result  our ability to identify and evaluate prospects  complete acquisitions and properly manage the integration of businesses is unproven 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments  it may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in making or attempting to make acquisitions or investments  we face a number of risks  including identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates  performing appropriate due diligence  identifying potential liabilities and negotiating acceptable terms for acquisitions and investments  reducing our working capital and hindering our ability to expand or maintain our business  including making capital expenditures and funding operations  if we make acquisitions out of our existing cash  the potential distraction of our management  diversion of our resources and disruption of our business  retaining and motivating key employees of the acquired companies  managing operations that are distant from our current headquarters and operations  entering into geographic markets in which we have little or no prior experience  competing for acquisition opportunities with competitors that are larger than we are or have greater financial and other resources than we have  accurately forecasting the financial impact of an acquisition or investment  assuming liabilities of acquired companies  including litigation related to the operation of the business prior to the acquisition  maintaining good relations with the customers and suppliers of the acquired company  and effectively integrating acquired companies or investments into the company and achieving expected synergies 
if we need additional financing to maintain or expand our business  it may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
although we believe our current cash and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months and the foreseeable future  we may need additional funds to expand or meet all of our operating needs 
if we need additional financing  we cannot be certain that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt  the ownership interest of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and any additional equity securities we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our stockholders 
also  the terms of any additional financing we obtain may significantly limit our future financing and operating activities 
if we need funds and cannot raise them on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop and enhance our software to remain competitive  take advantage of future opportunities  such as acquisitions  respond to changing customer needs and our competitors innovations  or attract and retain qualified key personnel 
any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial condition and limit our growth 
the loss of third party hardware distributors and suppliers could harm our business 
a number of customers expect us to be able to source hardware that will facilitate the implementation of our software solutions 
we do not intend to continue selling hardware and have transferred the fulfillment of all hardware orders to third party distributors 
thus  we are largely dependent on third parties for the supply of hardware components  some of which are based on proprietary designs  the assembly of hardware  and the distribution of hardware to our customers 
if these hardware distributors or suppliers experience financial  operational or quality assurance difficulties  or if there is any other disruption in our relationship  we may be required to locate other hardware distributors 
if our distributors or we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of materials and components  we will be subject to the following risks cancellations of orders due to unavailability of hardware  increased hardware prices  which may make our solutions less attractive  and additional development expense to modify our products to work with new hardware configurations 
even if we and or our distributors are successful in locating alternative sources of supply  alternative suppliers could increase prices significantly and with immediate effect 
in addition  alternative components may not be identical to previous components and may malfunction or interact with other components in unexpected ways 
the use of new suppliers and the modification of our products will require testing and may require further modifications or other remedial action  which may result in additional expense to us  diversion of management attention and other resources  inability to fulfill customer orders or delay in fulfillment  reduction in quality and reliability  customer dissatisfaction  and other adverse effects on our reputation  business and operating results 
our stock price has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors 
in addition  the securities markets as a whole have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations from time to time that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
any announcement with respect to any adverse variance in revenue or earnings from levels generally expected by securities analysts or investors for a given period could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our competitors or third parties  changing conditions in the market for products that record and analyze customer interactions  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  loss of a major customer  additions or departures of key personnel  changes in estimates by securities analysts  announcements of extraordinary events  such as acquisitions or litigation  or general economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
terrorist attacks and other acts of war may adversely affect the markets in which we operate  our operations and our stock price 
terrorist attacks and other acts of war  and any response to them  may cause instability in financial markets 
armed hostilities and terrorism may also directly impact our facilities  personnel and operations  as well as those of our clients 
furthermore  terrorist attacks or acts of war may result in temporary halts of commercial activity in the affected regions  and may result in reduced demand for our products 
these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price of our common stock 
government regulation of telephone and internet monitoring could cause a decline in the use of our software  result in increased expenses for us or subject our customers and us to liability 
as the telecommunications industry continues to evolve  state  federal and foreign governments including supranational governmental organizations such as the european union may increasingly regulate the monitoring of telecommunications and telephone and internet monitoring and recording products  such as our software 
we believe that increases in regulation could come in the form of a number of different kinds of regulations  including regulations regarding privacy  protection of personal information and employment 
for example  the state of california recently enacted the database security breach act  which requires any business that suffers a computer security breach to immediately notify customers in california if personal information has been compromised 
the adoption of any new regulations or changes made to existing regulations could cause a decline in the use of our software and could result in increased expenses for us  particularly if we are required to modify our software to accommodate these new or changing regulations 
moreover  new regulations or changes to existing regulations could subject our customers and us to liability 
in addition  whether or not these regulations are adopted  if we do not adequately address the privacy concerns of consumers  companies may be hesitant to use our software 
if any of these events occur  it could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may face difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel  which are necessary to effectively manage and expand our business 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to hire  train  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified personnel  particularly in sales  marketing  research and development  service and support 
we expect to continue to grant employees options to purchase our stock in order to attract  retain and motivate these individuals 
when we grant employees options to purchase common stock with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our stock  this may cause dilution to our stockholders if the market price of our stock increases above the exercise price 
however  if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel or if we experience high personnel turnover  it could prevent us from effectively managing and expanding our business 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers  particularly our chairman and chief executive officer  david gould  and our president and chief operating officer  nick discombe 
we have employment agreements with mr 
gould and mr 
discombe and limited non compete agreements with most of our other executive officers 
however  any of our executive officers and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
the loss of the services of our executive officers or other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
in addition  if one or more of our executive officers or key employees were to join one of our competitors or otherwise compete with us  it could harm our business 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware law  may prevent or delay a future takeover 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us without consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms which makes it difficult to remove all our directors at once 
a potential acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to remove directors at an annual meeting 
our board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock which would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
in addition  delaware law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
in october  our board of directors approved  and we have implemented  a stockholder rights plan which has the effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by the board of directors
