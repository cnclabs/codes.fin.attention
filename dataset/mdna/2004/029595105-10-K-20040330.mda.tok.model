the income tax benefit is a result of compensation expense that was recognized when these options for common shares were granted in the company began recording a federal and state income tax provision in as the company s deferred tax liability began to exceed its deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance that had been provided for the deferred tax asset in excess of the deferred tax liability was eliminated in second quarter the company anticipates that it will continue to record income tax expense if it operates profitably in the future 
currently there are minimal actual tax payments required due to net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets available for tax purposes

the dso was and days as of december  and december   respectively 
we expect dso to fluctuate in the future depending on timing of customer payments received and the mix of fee per use vs 
retail customers 
other receivables decreased by  primarily due to receipt of payments and application of credits due on over payment of sales and use taxes 
investing activities used  of cash in primarily for the purchase of current and future gamma knife units and related site costs 
financing activities used  of cash during  primarily due to principal payments on long term debt of  distributions to minority owners of  and the payment of dividends of  working capital decreased  to  at december  from  at december  primarily due to an increase in the current portion of long term debt 
the increase in debt was primarily due to the financing of three additional gamma knife units during  as well as an increase in the principal portion of debt payments on existing financing as that debt approaches maturity 
the company invests its cash in money market funds to minimize the potential for principal erosion 
cash is invested in these short term funds pending use in the company s operations 
the company believes its cash position combined with its working capital is adequate to service the company s cash requirements in the company finances all of its gamma knife units  and anticipates that it will continue to do so with future contracts  but there can be no assurance that financing will continue to be available on acceptable terms 
the company s primary lender  dvi  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection during the company has made claims in dvi s bankruptcy case for certain unfunded amounts under credit agreements in place at the time of the bankruptcy filing 
the principal balance of notes that included the unfunded amounts were transferred by dvi to third parties 
the company believes that it is too early in the process to develop any definitive view regarding the outcome of the claim 
the company continues to make payments on the outstanding note balances with dvi 
the company has made cash payments  as needed  toward projects in progress and is in the process of securing financing for those and future projects from other potential lending sources 
the company meets all debt covenants required under notes with dvi  and expects that any covenants required by future lenders will be acceptable to the company 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations because a substantial majority of the costs that it incurs under its customer contracts are fixed through the term of the contract 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   the corporation s significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts  hedge basis adjustments  or other similar carrying value adjustments 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period total amounts less than after contractual obligations committed year years years years long term debt future gamma knife purchases operating leases total contractual obligations the company has deposits toward the purchase of future gamma knife units as more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
it is uncertain when these units will be placed in service  so it cannot be determined when the commitment is due 
for purposes of this table  these commitments are listed in the year category 
further discussion of the long term debt commitment is included in note  and operating leases in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company has no significant off balance sheet arrangements 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are 
table of contents valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition to be two areas that required the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the following are our critical accounting policies in which management s estimates  assumptions and judgments most directly and materially affect the financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized when services have been rendered and collectability is reasonably assured  on either a fee per use or revenue sharing basis 
the company has thirteen fee per use customers and four revenue sharing customers 
for fee per use agreements  revenue is not estimated because these contracts provide for a fixed fee per procedure  and are typically for a ten year term 
revenue is recognized at the time the procedures are performed  based on each customer s contracted rate 
under revenue sharing agreements  revenue is recognized based on estimates generated from direct billings to patients or their third party payors  and net of any contractual discounts and other arrangements for providing services 
revenue from direct patient billing amounted to approximately  and of revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the revenue estimates are reviewed continuously and adjusted as necessary to ensure that the estimates fairly represent the amounts we expect to realize 
while historically payments received have been within our expectations  an inability to accurately estimate revenue from direct billings to patients in the future could have a material impact on operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on possible losses relating to the company s revenue sharing customers 
the company receives reimbursement from the customer based on the customer s collections from individuals and third party payors such as insurance companies and medicare 
receivables are charged against the allowance in the period that they are deemed uncollectible 
if the company s net accounts receivable estimates for revenue sharing customers as of december  changed by as much as based on actual collection information  it would have the effect of increasing or decreasing revenue by approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below presents information about certain market sensitive financial instruments as of december  the fair values were determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
maturity date  year ending december thereafter total fair value amounts in thousands fixed rate long term debt average interest rates at december   we had no significant long term  market sensitive investments 
our cash is invested in short term money market funds to minimize potential for principal erosion
