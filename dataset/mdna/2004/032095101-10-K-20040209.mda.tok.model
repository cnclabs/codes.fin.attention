such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales approx 
million of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure  datacom and industrial markets 
these declines occurred primarily in north america and to a lesser extent in europe and resulted from a generally slowing economy and a continuing slowdown in communication related markets 
major oem customers that manufacture equipment for telecom infrastructure including wireless and internet related applications experienced a slowdown in purchases from system operators due to a variety of factors including the availability of capital and a shortfall from expectations of demand 
such declines were partially offset by increased sales approx 
million of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace  automotive and wireless handset markets 
the increase in sales of military aerospace products approximately million  relates primarily to the acquisition of a backplane assembly business in north america

the environmental investigation  remedial and monitoring activities identified by the company  including those referred to above  are covered under the honeywell agreement 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating  aluminum  copper  brass and steel used for contacts  shells and cable  and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies  inserts and cable 
in general  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs

pensions the company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan plan covering substantially all us employees 
plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory 
certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees 
the pension expense credit for all pension plans approximated million  
million and 
million in  and  respectively  and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january of the applicable year  including an expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for us plans  we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical fourteen year compounded return of  which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return of  with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of and with high yield bond managers  with an expected rate of return of 
as of december   our asset allocation was with equity managers and with fixed income managers  including high yield managers 
we believe that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
based on this methodology the company s expected long term rate of return assumption is for both and the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations 
the discount rate on this basis has decreased from at december  to at december  this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in by approximately 
million 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased basis points  the pension liability would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
the financial markets declined significantly in  which had an adverse effect on plan assets 
this resulted in a million non cash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders equity 
such charge represented an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of million  net of deferred taxes 
the company made a cash contribution to the us pension plans in of million 
the liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations declined modestly in to million from million in  as the positive impact on assets of improved investment returns was offset by the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non us plans 
the company estimates that  based on current actuarial calculations  it will make a cash contribution to the pension plan in of approximately million 
cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available 
the company s significant accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products 
allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts  discounts  returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience  current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates average cost  or market 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
should future product demand change  existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 
depreciable assets property  plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions 
historically  the company has not had any significant impairments 
the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the company s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands long term debt      capital lease obligations   operating leases      purchase obligations   other long term liabilities    total      item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations  and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company s worldwide operations 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk relative to interest rate risk  the company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the second quarter as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above 
in conjunction with the refinancing  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the company s libor interest rate on million and million of floating rate debt at and  expiring in and  respectively 
at december   the company s average libor rate was 
a change in the libor interest rate at december  would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 
million 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
