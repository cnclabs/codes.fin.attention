item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview lafarge north america produces cement  ready mixed concrete  aggregates and gypsum drywall 
our customers are primarily construction contractors or other businesses involved in the construction industry 
our sales and earnings come from deliveries of our products or the sales of construction services  and we receive cash from our customers within normal payment terms 
we are increasing our efforts to move beyond being a traditional materials provider to competing based on value 
we seek to add value through the application of our industry leading expertise  development of new high performance materials  and creation of responsive solutions to customer problems 
as the largest diversified supplier of construction materials in the united states and canada  lafarge north america operates in an industry in which capital investment decisions and financial performance are viewed from a long term perspective 
because both the raw materials for our products and the products themselves are expensive to transport  our businesses are generally very local  with local customers and local competitors 
the structure of the markets in which we compete  and the demand for individual products  vary for each business line 
in general  demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic conditions and trends in the construction industry 
also  our significant presence in northern geographic markets makes our operating results sensitive to weather conditions 
company management is focused primarily on two key priorities delivering higher performance and expanding the company through disciplined growth and development 
through the application of proprietary performance programs  management seeks to leverage key strategic  operational  cost and revenue drivers in 
table of contents each product segment to improve the quality of our products and services  and mitigate negative cost and market pressures on our financial results 
in  management intensified our focus on customer orientation 
although we completed few acquisitions during the year  management continues to actively identify and evaluate opportunities for top line growth  particularly in aggregates  that meet our financial return criteria 
summary of results and outlook our operating performance in benefited somewhat from the improvement in us and canadian economic growth as well as the favorable canadian exchange rate 
low interest rates continued to stimulate residential construction  but state fiscal deficits constrained highway construction and other public projects 
our results have also been affected by weather patterns  as the unusually wet winter and record spring rainfall slowed construction and paving activities in many of our markets in the first half year of the strong improvement in market conditions in the second half of the year  combined with good operating performance in our plants  allowed us to recover almost all of the shortfall from the first half of the year by year end as we generated percent of our full year earnings in the last six months of the year 
overall  our income from continuing operations  before corporate and unallocated expenses  was in line with although pension and postretirement expense increased million  our results were also favorably impacted by the stronger canadian dollar 
cement profitability was equal to last year as higher volumes and higher prices in canada offset weaker us cement prices and increased pension expense 
our gypsum business returned to profitability in the second half of the year for the first time since december due to a combination of price and volume increases and improved manufacturing performance 
construction materials operating income was percent below last year 
profitability of the aggregate segment was in line with last year  but was offset by lower results of ready mixed concrete  primarily due to weak conditions in western us markets  as well as the negative performance and our exit from portable highway paving activities in some western states and higher pension costs 
net income in was million  or per share diluted  compared with net income of million  or per share diluted in there were a number of specific items affecting our earnings in both and in  net income includes net income from discontinued operations of million  or per share diluted  compared with million  or per share diluted in in addition  in  net income includes million  or per share related to a divestment gain from the relocation of the company s detroit  michigan cement terminal  offset by an increase in our canadian deferred tax provision due to the enactment in december of higher corporate tax rates in ontario 
the results contain a net gain of million  or per share diluted from one time tax adjustments and a gain on the sale of the company s canadian paving stone business  offset by a charge for the idling of gypsum plant in wilmington  delaware 
looking forward to  our earnings comparison will be negatively affected by the absence of income from discontinued operations and the million pre tax gain realized on the detroit cement terminal 
outside of these large non operating items  management is cautiously optimistic about the company s prospects 
at this time  we anticipate that we can achieve price improvement in most of our products and markets in in addition  we expect further cost and revenue benefits in from continued implementation of our performance programs in all of our product lines 
we also expect an increase in pension and post retirement expense of approximately million dollars in the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
management s discussion of income the consolidated statements of income included in item of this annual report summarize the operating performance of lafarge north america inc for the past three years 
it should be noted that the discussions focus on earnings from continuing operations 
lafarge florida inc our cement import and grinding operation was sold to florida rock industries inc in august the florida operations  including 
table of contents the gain on the sale  are shown separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations in both and to facilitate analysis  net sales and operating profit are discussed by operating segment and are summarized in the table below 
see note segment and related information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further segment information 
our three operating segments are construction materials the production and distribution of construction aggregate  ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and asphalt  and the construction and paving of roads 
cement and cement related products the production and distribution of portland and specialty cements and slag  fly ash and associated blended products  and the processing of fuel quality waste and alternative raw materials for use in cement kilns

year ended december  net sales our net sales from continuing operations increased percent in to  million from  million in demand for our products appeared to remain solid and we benefited during the third and fourth quarters from the pent up demand that built up during the first half of the year  when market conditions were particularly difficult due to poor weather 
cement  aggregate and gypsum wallboard shipments for the full year were above last year  while shipments of ready mixed concrete were flat  and asphalt and paving sales fell short of last year 
when compared to  our selling prices generally increased  with the exception of the us cement market and our paving business 
in addition  net sales benefited from continued strength of the canadian dollar  which finished the year close to cents 
excluding the exchange rate effect  net sales from continuing operations were equal to last year 
excluding the favorable exchange rate effect  the increase in cement and gypsum net sales was partially offset by the drop in sales of our construction materials operations 
by region  us net sales from continuing operations decreased to  million in compared to  million in  driven by lower cement and asphalt and paving sales 
canadian net sales increased percent to  million in percent excluding the favorable exchange rate effect  primarily due to higher cement  aggregate and ready mixed concrete sales 
construction materials net sales from construction materials operations totaled  million in  percent higher than the  million in excluding the impact of favorable canadian exchange rate  net sales were down percent 
stronger sales in construction aggregates were offset by a decline in asphalt and paving sales 
net sales of construction aggregates were million  percent higher than higher excluding the favorable exchange rate 
shipments of construction aggregates increased percent in to million tons  with us volumes up percent as a result of higher sales in missouri and new mexico as well as higher resales in the great lakes 
canadian volumes were percent lower than levels due to lower shipments in most of our western canadian markets as well as lower exports to the us west coast 
average selling prices in were up percent in canada  in local currency  and percent in the us due in part to a better product mix as well as successful implementation of general price increases in most markets 

table of contents ready mixed concrete sales totaled million in  up percent from last year flat to  excluding the favorable exchange rate 
overall ready mix concrete shipments fell slightly to million cubic yards with stronger demand in canada offsetting a percent volume decline in western us markets 
the deterioration in the construction economy in colorado and new mexico resulted in both lower volume and prices 
canadian volumes increased by percent over  with sustained project work in the energy mining sector atlantic  montreal and vancouver 
in addition  average canadian prices in local currency increased by percent compared to last year due to strong project pricing and higher value added sales 
asphalt and paving sales totaled million in  down percent from down  excluding the favorable exchange rate 
asphalt and paving volumes were down percent and percent  respectively  in compared to prior year 
lower volumes in the us were due primarily to weather in the first half of the year  weak construction activity in our principal western us markets as well as our exit from our new mexico based portable highway paving segment in the second quarter of further contributing to lower sales was lower demand in east canada due to a weather related slow start of the paving season and less asphalt paving content in projects 
cement and cement related products cement net sales from continuing operations increased percent to  million in from  million in up percent excluding the favorable exchange rate 
with strong shipments in the fourth quarter  full year sales volumes from our continuing operations in reached million tons  up percent from sales volumes in the us increased a modest percent compared to while in canada  sales volumes increased percent as demand was up sharply in the western provinces 
average selling prices in canada were up percent in local currency  reflecting the impact of general price increases implemented early in the year 
prices in the us declined percent as the planned april price increase met with limited success and some price degradation occurred due to competitive activity in several markets 
gypsum net sales from gypsum operations increased by percent to million from million in  benefiting from strong demand as well as the impact of the price increases implemented in the second half of the year 
sales volume reached billion square feet  an increase of percent from  which is in line with the increase in demand reported by the gypsum association for the markets served by our plants 
the average mill net price per thousand square feet for the year was compared with in prices increased significantly during the fourth quarter and a further price increase was implemented in january performance by line of business construction materials our construction materials operations earned million on sales of billion  down percent from earnings of million on sales of billion 
the favorable impact of the canadian dollar  which contributed million to construction materials reported profit for the year  was more than offset by an million dollar increase in pension and post retirement costs 
in addition  losses incurred in our western us portable highway paving business that we exited in the first half of and lower levels of paving activities in colorado reduced profits for the year 
as a result  construction material operating income as a percentage of net sales was percent in compared to percent in levels 
construction aggregates recorded an operating income of million in  in line with last year  as higher volumes and prices were offset by increased pension expenses million and higher operating costs resulting in part from weather related inefficiencies 
ready mixed concrete profits declined million to million in most of the shortfall was in the western us as continued weak market conditions resulted in a percent drop in volumes and competitive price pressures 
in canada  ready mixed concrete profits were equal to last year as a decline in 
table of contents eastern canada  due largely to difficult market conditions in toronto  was offset by improved profitability in our western canadian operations  due to higher volumes in vancouver and generally higher margins 
our ready mixed concrete operations were negatively impacted by an annual increase of million in pension expense in asphalt and paving operations earned million in  about million less than in prior year 
profits in eastern canada increased by over as lower costs and improved margins offset lower volumes 
weak market conditions in the western us  combined with losses associated with the portable highway paving operations that we exited during the year  resulted in a significant drop in earnings in that market  more than offsetting the improvement in eastern canada 
in addition  pension expense for this product line increased million in cement and cement related products cement operating profit from continuing operations was million  in line with last year 
the favorable impact of the canadian dollar was million dollars  which offset a million dollar increase in pension and post retirement costs 
higher volumes and higher prices in canada were partially offset by weaker us prices 
in addition  margins declined as most of the increased tonnage sold in the second half of the year came out of inventory rather than incremental production 
in terms of operating costs  fixed costs were lower by million due to lower maintenance expenses as well as the absence of costs related to the start up of our new plant near kansas city and the bath strike in variable costs per ton was down slightly for the year as significant improvement in fuel cost at our exshaw plant  due to the conversion to coal from natural gas  was largely offset by a reduction in the availability and pricing of fuel quality waste used in some of our plants 
finally  the profitability of our cement related products business declined in  primarily due to lower slag results and clinker sales volumes 
as a result  cement operating income from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales was percent in  down from percent in the prior year 
gypsum our gypsum drywall operations returned to profitability starting in the second half of  as we benefited from continued strong residential demand and higher prices  particularly in the fourth quarter 
for the full year  the gypsum operations lost million  an improvement of million from due to a combination of improved manufacturing performance as well as price and volume increases 
production volumes from our two newer plants in kentucky and florida now account for percent of total production compared to percent last year 
the idling of our wilmington plant in late resulted in the anticipated cost savings of approximately million 
however  higher natural gas prices  increased wage rates  higher labor costs related to increased production levels in our remaining plants  as well as increased pension costs and higher depreciation expense offset the wilmington savings in the operating loss of million excludes a million charge recorded in other income expense  net for the idling of our wilmington  delaware plant 
as a result  gypsum s operating result as a percentage of net sales was negative percent in  a significant improvement over the negative percent in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses totaled million in compared with million in as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses reached percent in  an increase of percent 
the increase resulted primarily from the unfavorable impact of the canadian dollar million and higher pension expenses million 
income from managed assets income from managed assets amounts to million in both and gross proceeds from the management of these assets totaled million in  compared to million in total proceeds included billings for the annual management fee million in both years  as well as direct 
table of contents payroll  pension and post retirement costs and allocated selling  general and administrative expenses 
we are fully reimbursed for these expenses under the terms of the management agreement 
other income expense  net other expense income  net was income of million in compared to expense of million in this variation includes  among others  the absence of a million provision in for the idling of our gypsum drywall plant in wilmington  delaware  a million increase in gains on sale of fixed assets and a million decrease in the cost of our accounts receivable securitization program 
these favorable items were mostly offset by a million increase in foreign exchange transaction losses and the absence of an million reversal in of the natural gas derivative mark to market provision 
earnings from continuing operations before minority interests  interest and income taxes ebit ebit from continuing operations was million in compared to million in improved performance of our gypsum division  a reduction in corporate and unallocated expenses of million mainly resulting from changes in other income expense  net and a million benefit from the stronger canadian dollar contributed to the higher earnings 
these items helped offset a million increase in pension and other post retirement expenses 
interest expense interest expense for the year was million  up million from due to the absence of million of capitalized interest in and a million interest expense increase from a long term bond issued in june these were offset somewhat by a reduction in short term interest expense due to a combination of lower debt levels and lower interest rates 
interest income interest income was million  a decrease of million from as foreign exchange losses of million on us dollar investments in canada  due to the devaluation of the us dollar  offset an increase in interest from investments 
income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations increased from million in to million in  including an million deferred tax adjustment in due to provincial tax changes legislated in both ontario and alberta as well as the higher tax rate applicable to the sale of the detroit cement terminal in the third quarter 
the results benefited from the recognition of approximately million in non recurring tax benefits related to the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance million and the favorable final settlement of various tax issues with both us and canadian authorities million in the fourth quarter 
excluding these tax adjustments  the effective tax rate for was percent compared with approximately percent in net income net income was million  or per share diluted  compared with net income in of million or per share diluted 
net income in from continuing operations  which excludes the results of the divested florida operations  was million  or per share diluted  compared with million  or per share diluted in the results include a net gain of million  or per share related to the increase in the canadian deferred tax provision and a divestment gain from the relocation of the company s detroit  michigan  cement terminal 
the results contain a net gain of million  or per share diluted from favorable tax adjustments and a gain on the sale of the company s canadian paving stone business  offset by a charge for the idling of our gypsum plant in wilmington  delaware 

table of contents net income from discontinued operations for the full year was million  or per share diluted including the divestment gain after tax of million  or per share diluted  compared with million  or per share diluted  in year ended december  the comparative information for the year has been reclassified to present the divested operations of lafarge florida inc as discontinued operations 
the reclassification was not made to the financial statements as the reclassification of discontinued operations is not considered material for to facilitate comparability  we have also included relevant analysis of the performance of our cement segment between and  excluding lafarge florida inc in both years 
net sales our net sales from continuing operations decreased percent in to  million from  million in net sales decreased percent when sales of million from lafarge florida inc are excluded from the increase in gypsum net sales partially offset the drop in sales of our construction materials and cement operations 
lower construction materials sales were driven mostly by lower asphalt and paving sales and the absence of sales from recently divested operations 
the decline in cement sales was due to the absence of sales from our discontinued operations in by region  us net sales from continuing operations decreased to  million in compared to  million in  but are flat when sales from lafarge florida inc are excluded from canadian net sales decreased percent to  million in  primarily due to significantly lower asphalt and paving sales in the ontario market 
except for gypsum drywall and canadian aggregate and concrete volumes  sales volumes decreased in most of our product lines due to weaker demand as a result of the sluggish commercial building sector 
these decreases were offset by improved pricing  which held up in most of our business lines in spite of slowing markets 
construction materials net sales from construction materials operations totaled  million in  percent lower than the all time high of  million reached in  with the most significant drop coming from asphalt and paving activity 
asphalt and paving sales totaled million  down percent from demand in canada was lower with volumes off percent compared to as a civil servants strike in ontario resulted in a slowdown in construction activity and delays in project tendering 
further contributing to the net sales decline was slower demand in the colorado and new mexico highway paving markets  resulting in strong competitive project bidding activity and decreased prices and margins 
overall asphalt and paving volumes were down percent for the whole year  as us operations showed a smaller decline compared to canada 
ready mixed concrete sales totaled million  down percent from overall ready mix concrete shipments were million cubic yards in  percent lower than the previous year 
in the us  volumes were down percent to million cubic yards 
excluding divested wisconsin operations  heritage volumes in the us were down percent for the year  with lower volumes reported in most of our markets 
in the eastern us  most of the shortfall occurred in the fourth quarter due to a return to normal winter weather and slowing activity in maryland and new york 
western us volumes dropped during the last half of the year as economic conditions deteriorated in colorado and new mexico 
average selling prices increased percent during the year as increases in most of our key markets were sufficient to offset lower prices in toronto  colorado and new mexico 
in toronto  a sharp decline in commercial construction and overcapacity in the industry led to a difficult pricing environment 
deterioration in the construction economy in colorado and new mexico resulted in both lower volume and prices 
net sales of construction aggregates were million  percent higher than shipments of construction aggregates were percent lower in at million tons  with us volumes down percent as a result of weaker demand in the great lakes and western us markets 
canadian volumes were percent 
table of contents higher than levels  as strong volumes in western canada offset a percent drop in eastern canada 
average selling prices in were percent higher than last year 
cement and cement related products cement net sales declined to  million in from  million in net sales in declined percent  excluding lafarge florida inc in  as improved selling prices were offset by a percent shortfall in shipments 
excluding lafarge florida inc in both periods  sales volumes in reached million tons  down percent from sales volumes in the us  excluding lafarge florida inc  fell percent in the fourth quarter as a series of winter storms hampered construction activity in the great lakes and eastern us markets compared to mild winter weather during the last three months of in canada  the percent decline in sales volumes for the full year resulted from lower consumption in western canada  where we have our largest market share  due in part to lower oil field activity early in the year 
for the full year  average prices in the us  excluding lafarge florida inc  increased percent while average selling prices in canada were up percent in local currency  reflecting the impact of price increases implemented earlier in the year as well as favorable product mix 
gypsum net sales from gypsum operations increased by percent to million from million in drywall sales volumes reached billion square feet  a percent increase compared to prior year largely because of added production from the newark  new jersey plant that we acquired in january shipments from heritage plants were up percent for the year 
production increased at every plant in the network except at the wilmington  delaware facility  which was idled in the fourth quarter of manufacturing performance continued to improve at our two state of the art plants in kentucky and florida  which shipped billion square feet of drywall in  or percent of our total production 
additionally  drywall prices averaged per thousand square feet  a percent improvement compared to last year following industry price increases in march and september 
overall  drywall demand weakened in the fourth quarter in our heritage business  and prices declined to the lower s by year end 
performance by line of business construction materials our construction materials operations before corporate and unallocated expenses earned million on sales of billion  down from earnings of million on sales of billion 
asphalt and paving operations accounted for million of the earnings decline  while the absence of profits from recent divestments accounted for another million 
the balance of the earnings decline of million resulted primarily from lower earnings of our ready mix concrete business and higher sg a expense due in part to approximately million in reorganization costs incurred during the year 
while volumes generally declined in  the combination of market price increases and greater focus on higher value added products enabled us to achieve year over year price improvement in most of our product lines 
as a result  construction materials operating income as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in in spite of a percent decline in volumes  aggregates profits for the year of million equaled those in as generally higher selling prices and improved cost performance offset the negative volume impact 
ready mix profits declined million to million in this decline occurred primarily in three markets in the western us  where weak market conditions throughout the second half of the year led to lower volumes  in toronto  where competitive activity and lower commercial construction resulted in a significant drop in selling prices  and in montreal  where we experienced a month concrete truck drivers strike 
in several other markets  the general decline in commercial construction activity contributed to a deterioration in ready mix margins in as a greater proportion of our volumes were sold to the lower margin residential construction market 

table of contents asphalt and paving operations earned million in  about million less than in prior year 
margins deteriorated in canada and the us due to a significant drop in volumes percent for asphalt and percent for paving  the effect of which was partially offset by lower operating cost 
cement and cement related products cement operating profit from continuing operations declined percent to million in excluding lafarge florida inc s operating profit of million from  operating profit declined only percent  in spite of lower sales volumes  as the volume shortfall and million of costs associated with a six month strike at the bath  ontario cement plant were partially offset by improved prices  the favorable impact on depreciation expense of a change in the estimated useful lives of our cement plants and lower fixed manufacturing costs  particularly in the area of maintenance 
overall  cement operating margin from continuing operations of percent was slightly higher than the percent in gypsum our gypsum drywall operations reported an operating loss of million  million better than the operating loss of million incurred in a combination of strong volume growth  percent including the newark  new jersey facility  higher selling prices and improved operating efficiency helped the gypsum division reduce its operating loss 
average us selling prices for the year were approximately per msf  up from in during the year  progress was made in lowering our cost structure as variable manufacturing costs per thousand square feet msf were percent lower than while transportation and delivery costs were down percent 
the reduction in variable costs was primarily attributable to lower energy  paper and gypsum costs due to a combination of lower raw material prices as well as improved efficiency 
these cost savings were partially offset by higher labor costs related to the higher production levels of a portion of our natural gas requirements was contracted at fixed prices for the year 
in  the fixed prices were higher than the market prices  resulting in a million unfavorable impact on our results 
the operating loss of million excludes a million charge recorded in other income expense  net for the idling of our wilmington  delaware plant 
gypsum operating loss as a percentage of net sales was at negative percent in  a significant improvement compared to negative percent in this improvement resulted from a significant increase in selling prices and reduced variable costs  reflecting lower energy  paper and gypsum costs due to both raw material price trends and improved efficiency 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses totaled million in compared with million in excluding lafarge florida inc 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses reached percent in  an increase of percent flat to  excluding lafarge florida inc 
the increase resulted primarily from approximately million in reorganization and relocation costs incurred during the year in our businesses  as well as programs to increase bench strength and to create and improve shared services across our operations 
goodwill amortization our operating results reflect the new financial accounting standards board fasb rules under which we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill 
the absence of goodwill amortization increased income from operations by million in compared to income from managed assets income from managed assets amounts to million in compared to million in  which represents a full year of blue circle north america management fees 
the significant increase million in direct and allocated cost and expenses to million in reflects the hiring of virtually all of the employees of blue circle north america as of january  and an increase in other cost and expenses 
table of contents that are directly allocated to the managed assets 
we are fully reimbursed for these expenses under the terms of the management agreement 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was a million expense in compared to million million excluding lafarge florida inc in this includes among others  million divestment gains which is million more than in  the reversal of the natural gas derivative mark to market provision of million and a million decrease in the cost of our accounts receivable securitization program 
these favorable items were mostly offset by the million provision for the idling of our gypsum drywall plant in wilmington  delaware 
earnings from continuing operations before minority interests  interest and income taxes ebit ebit from continuing operations of million in compared to million in ebit  when excluding lafarge florida inc from  increased million in as improved performance of our gypsum division helped offset the decline in results of our construction materials and cement businesses 
in addition  a reduction in corporate and unallocated expenses of million was recorded in we recognized a pre tax charge to earnings of million related to the idling of our gypsum drywall plant in wilmington  delaware 
this provision together with increased pension and other post retirement expenses million were offset by the absence of million in goodwill amortization under new fasb rules  the reversal of the million derivative loss for our natural gas contracts recorded in and a million increase in divestment gains due primarily to the sale of our paving stones business 
interest expense interest expense for the year was million  down million million excluding lafarge florida inc from due to a combination of lower debt and lower interest rates 
capitalized interest was million in  down from million in interest income interest income was million  an increase of million from as increased cash from our canadian operations generated higher interest income 
income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations decreased from million in to million in  including the recognition of approximately million in favorable us tax adjustments in the fourth quarter 
income tax expense in  excluding lafarge florida inc  was million 
we reversed a million deferred tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of considering the continued favorable long term outlook of the us market for our products  particularly in light of our ability to generate taxable income during the recent economic downturn  and our projection of future taxable income in the us  we have determined that there is no longer sufficient reason to believe that the related deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in addition  a favorable tax adjustment totaling million was recorded in the fourth quarter to reflect the final settlement of various issues with both us and canadian tax authorities 
excluding these tax adjustments  the effective tax rate for the full year was approximately percent 
this compared to an effective tax rate of percent in  excluding the favorable one time adjustment of approximately canadian million us million in deferred tax balances due to reduction in canadian taxes 

table of contents net income net income improved by percent to million per diluted share in  despite the prolonged economic slowdown and return to normal winter weather conditions in the last three months of the year 
in  we recorded net income of million per diluted share 
overall  in a difficult environment  our performance in most product lines was solid and our results demonstrate the benefits of our geographic and product line diversification 
our full year profitability held up very well in spite of a contraction of the market  and us cement prices improved in spite of lower demand 
profitability and operating margins in the aggregates business were maintained and aggregate prices improved in a weaker market 
our gypsum business  while still in a loss position  significantly improved in terms of volumes  prices and costs 
our weakest performance in was in our paving business 
the deterioration in the ontario market  due largely to the civil servants strike and its related impact on project tendering  and a very competitive market place and lower demand in the western us resulted in a significant deterioration in the profitability of this product line 
finally  in certain markets  such as metropolitan toronto  metro denver  montreal and new mexico our ready mix concrete profitability suffered in other factors affecting the company critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
goodwill on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
was issued in june and requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
in our goodwill impairment test  we use a combination of a market approach and an income approach when determining the fair value of our reporting units 
in the market approach  we compare our reporting units with similar businesses  business ownership interests or manufacturing facilities that have been sold 
in the income approach  we estimate the discounted value of the expected future cash flows that we expect our reporting units to generate based on our budgets and projections 
similar to our review for impairment of long lived assets  evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  the evolution of expenses  economic trends in the construction sector and other factors 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits the accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefits requires us to make certain assumptions that have a significant impact on the expenses and liabilities that we recorded for pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
the primary assumptions made to account for pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities are disclosed in note pension plan and other postretirement benefits of the consolidated financial statements 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of investment return on pension plan assets is based on historical performance  current and long term outlook and the asset mix in the pension trust funds 
the discount rates reflect the rate of long term high grade corporate bonds 
the pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses are impacted by the year end assumptions for the discount rate and the return rate on assets pension plan only 
if the discount rate assumption had been lowered by one percent  pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses would have increased by approximately million 
if the asset returns rate assumption had been lowered by one percent  pension plan expenses would have increased by approximately million 

table of contents we expect our pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses to increase by approximately million from to  and our minimum required cash contribution to defined benefit pension plans to increase by approximately million  due to both lower discount rates and a reduction in the expected return of pension plan assets 
also  an additional discretionary contribution of million was made to certain canadian defined benefit plans in february the accumulated benefit obligation is also impacted by the discount rate 
the impact of decreasing the discount rate assumption by one percent as of december  would have been to increase the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million  and would have increased the additional minimum pension liability amount by approximately million 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends in the construction sector and other factors 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reflected at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we did not identify and recognize any impairment during in november  an impairment was recognized in relation to the idling of the gypsum drywall plant in wilmington  delaware 
this resulted in a million asset write off 
environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability for environmental matters has been incurred  an undiscounted estimate of the required remediation costs is recorded as a liability in the consolidated financial statements  without offset of potential insurance recoveries 
environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of cement  cement related products  aggregates  ready mixed concrete  concrete products  asphalt and gypsum drywall is recorded when title and ownership are transferred upon delivery of the products 
revenue from waste recovery and disposal is recognized when the material is received  tested and accepted 
revenue from road construction contracts is recognized on the basis of units of work completed  while revenue from other indivisible lump sum contracts is recognized using the cost to cost method to determine the percentage of completion 
amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling are included in net sales  and costs incurred by us for shipping and handling are classified as cost of goods sold 
environmental matters our operations  like those of our competitors  are subject to federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations that impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste  require pollution control and prevention measures to be undertaken and require certain permits and approvals for us to conduct many of our operations 
as a consequence  we maintain an environmental program designed to monitor and control environmental matters relevant to us  including changes in applicable laws and regulations as well as instances where corrective action may be needed 
we recruit  employ and train personnel experienced in environmental matters who are responsible for identifying developments relating to environmental matters and bringing them to management s attention  including emergency reporting and quarterly reporting of environmental matters 
we routinely audit our properties to determine whether environmental remediation may be required  the amount of any necessary related provisions  the status of remedial activities undertaken and whether improvements may be required to meet current and future environmental requirements 

table of contents we may capitalize environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  improve the safety or efficiency of assets or that are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination 
we expense other environmental costs when incurred 
our environmental capital expenditures and expenses were not material for the years ended december   and and we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of our known environmental contingencies  for which we have recorded provisions for estimated probable liabilities  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  our environmental expenditures have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future 
changes to existing or new environmental laws or regulations  or interpretations thereof  may impose substantial further environmental obligations on us 
such changes may include revised epa boiler and industrial furnaces regulations  final residual risk or maximum achievable control technology provisions governing air toxic emissions  cement kiln dust management standards or programs  revised state implementation plans regarding nox reductions  revised state implementation plans regarding reduction of fine particulate matter particles  federal major source permit requirements  and implementation of the kyoto protocol  if ratified 
we cannot presently determine the effect such changes may have on us  including the nature and amount of any required capital expenditures or other remedial actions  or on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
management s discussion of cash flows the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our main sources and uses of cash 
these statements show the relationship between the operations presented in the consolidated statements of income and liquidity and financial resources depicted in the consolidated balance sheets 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of capital expenditures  working capital needs  debt service obligations and dividends 
we usually meet our operating liquidity needs through internal generation of cash except in the event of significant acquisitions 
short term borrowings are generally used to fund seasonal operating requirements  particularly in the first two calendar quarters 
cash flows from operations the net cash provided by operations for each of the three years presented reflects our net income adjusted for non cash items 
significant non cash adjustments are discussed below  except for changes in working capital which are discussed in management s discussion of financial position 
the non cash adjustment for depreciation  depletion and amortization in increased by million due to assets put in service in the course of mainly the sugar creek cement plant and the chicago slag operation  offset by the change in useful lives of our cement plants in july month impact of million decrease 
the decrease of million in was due to the absence of goodwill amortization million and the change in useful lives of our cement plants in july reduction of million in depreciation expense  partially offset by increased depreciation related to the new sugar creek cement plant put in service during and the newark gypsum plant acquired in january 
the non cash adjustment for gain on sale of assets was relatively similar million in and million in  as both years were impacted by large divestment gains detroit cement terminal in and paving stone divestiture in eastern canada in 
the impact of the gain on the sale of discontinued operations lafarge florida inc including related income taxes paid  is shown separately 
the adjustment for other non cash charges and credits  net in was only million  as no significant non recurring activity occurred in the other long term liability accounts 
in other non cash charges and credits  net increased to million from negative million in  mainly related to the provision of million related to the idling of the wilmington plant 
cash flows from investing in  net cash used for investing decreased million compared to capital expenditures decreased million in largely because ongoing development projects  such as the construction of the sugar creek  missouri plant and chicago slag project  were completed in spending on acquisitions 
table of contents decreased million to million as only a few small acquisitions were made 
purchases of short term investments  net  increased million from  as more of the excess cash in canada was invested in short term investments exceeding a maturity of three months 
proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  surplus land and other miscellaneous items totaled million in compared to million in  as both years had significant proceeds related to the detroit cement terminal in and paving stone divestiture in eastern canada in in addition to the routine sales of surplus land and retail mobile equipment 
the proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of million lafarge florida inc  and related income taxes paid  are shown separately 
in  net cash used for investing was million compared to million in capital expenditures decreased million in largely because ongoing development projects  such as the construction of the palatka  florida gypsum drywall plant and the sugar creek  missouri plant  were completed in early and early  respectively 
spending on acquisitions decreased million in to million  as we only had one sizable acquisition in continental gypsum 
proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets and property  plant and equipment totaled million in compared to million in  with the proceeds mainly coming from the divestment of the pressure pipe and paving stone operations in eastern canada 
cash flows from financing in  net cash consumed by financing was million compared to million in this increase of million resulted from the net repayment of short term borrowings of million in versus net repayment of only million in  an increase in dividends of million and a decrease in the issuance of equity securities of million  offset by an increase in long term debt mainly due to the issuance of an industrial revenue bond million related to the sugar creek  missouri plant 
in  net cash consumed by financing was million compared to million in this change of million resulted from the net repayment of short term borrowings of million in versus net proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings of million in offset by an increase in the issuance of equity securities of million  a decrease in repayment of long term debt million and the repurchase of common stock of million none in 
we have access to a wide variety of short term and long term financing alternatives in both the us and canada 
these include a million commercial paper facility backed by a syndicated  day committed bank revolver  as well as a second  million multi year committed bank revolver maturing in at december  and  no amounts were outstanding under the multi year facility commercial paper borrowings as of december  and were zero and million  respectively 
we also have a receivables securitization program to provide a cost effective source of working capital and short term financing 
under the program  we agreed to transfer  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable to unrelated third party purchasers up to a maximum of million 
under the agreements  new receivables are added to the pool as collections reduce previously sold receivables 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold  which as of december  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
since this program is accounted for as a sale of receivables  the related cash flows are included in net cash provided by operations 
in  the strengthening of the canadian dollar resulted in a positive effect of million on the cash flow statement  directly related to the impact of exchange rate changes on the cash in canada 
management s discussion of financial position the consolidated balance sheets summarize our financial position at december  and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our canadian revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars  as well as interest rate risk inherent in our debt 
as more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we primarily use fixed rate debt 
table of contents instruments to reduce the risk of exposure to changes in interest rates and have used forward treasury lock agreements in the past to hedge interest rate changes on anticipated debt issuances 
the value reported for canadian dollar denominated net assets increased from december  as a result of a rise in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
at december   the us dollar equivalent of a canadian dollar was versus at december  based on results  if the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar changed by percent  our consolidated net assets would change by approximately percent and net income would change by approximately percent 
liquidity is not materially impacted  however  since canadian earnings are considered to be permanently invested in canada 
working capital  excluding cash  short term investments  short term borrowings  current portion of long term debt and the impact of exchange rate changes million increase  decreased million from december  to december  receivables  net including due from affiliates  excluding an exchange rate increase of million  increased million primarily due to a decrease in receivables sold under our securitization program 
inventories decreased million  excluding the exchange rate increase of million  due to increased levels of sales in the fourth quarter of compared to accounts payable and accrued liabilities  excluding the exchange rate increase of million  increased million mainly to an increase in amounts payable under our receivable sales agreement 
income taxes payable increased million  due to stronger earnings in the fourth quarter  resulting in higher income taxes payable 
net property  plant and equipment decreased million during  excluding the exchange rate increase of million  as depreciation outpaced capital expenditures 
no significant acquisitions were made in goodwill relates primarily to the redland  warren and presque isle transactions 
our capitalization is summarized in the following table december long term debt other long term liabilities and minority interests shareholders equity total capitalization no major changes in our capitalization occurred for the year ended december  as compared to december  the company s operating cash flows are generally sufficient to provide all of the cash operating requirements  including capital expenditures  on an annual basis  although short term debt to fund seasonal working capital needs and operating losses is incurred during the first six months of the year 
the company maintains sufficient liquidity resources  including a million  commercial paper line  a million accounts receivable securitization line  a committed million multi year revolver  a bi lateral committed facility of million  and over million in uncommitted bi lateral bank facilities  to ensure that its cash requirements are met under any circumstances 
a million bond  issued in to fund an acquisition  will mature in july at maturity  the company intends to use internal cash flow  existing  committed  short term debt capacity  or a new long term public debt issue to repay the bond 
in addition  beginning on december   canadian million approximately million in preferred shares issued by a canadian subsidiary in  in connection with the warren merger  will be redeemable at the option of the holder classified as minority interest obligation 
the company has sufficient liquidity in canada  including over canadian million approximately million in invested cash and short term investments  to meet this potential obligation 

table of contents our summary of contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands less than total one year years years years long term debt minority interest obligations operating lease purchase obligations total the amounts included in the line purchase obligations are based upon contractual purchase obligations related to gas  power  fuel and other significant raw material commitments 
management s discussion of shareholders equity the consolidated statements of shareholders equity summarize the activity in each component of shareholders equity for the three years presented 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million  a change in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a percent increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  and the exercise of stock options for million 
these were partially offset by dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million  and the recognition of a million minimum pension liability  net of income taxes 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million  the exercise of stock options for million and a foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a percent increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
these were partially offset by the recognition of a million additional minimum pension liability  net of income taxes  and dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million 
common equity interests include our par value per share common stock and the lafarge canada inc exchangeable preference shares  which are exchangeable into our common stock and have comparable voting  dividend and liquidation rights 
our common stock is traded on the new york and toronto stock exchanges under the ticker symbol laf and the exchangeable preference shares on the toronto stock exchange under the ticker symbol lcipre the following table reflects the range of high and low closing prices of common stock by quarter for and as quoted on the new york stock exchange quarters ended mar jun sep dec stock prices high low stock prices high low dividends are summarized in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december common equity dividends less dividend reinvestments net cash dividend payments common equity dividends per share as of the third quarter of  the dividend rate was changed from cents to cents per quarter 

table of contents management s discussion of selected consolidated financial data the selected consolidated financial data highlights certain significant trends in our financial condition and results of operations 
in  net sales increased by two percent due to acquisitions throughout our operations and improving economic conditions 
in  net sales increased by percent mainly due to acquisitions primarily warren paving materials group in canada  increased volumes from our heritage operations as well as increased average selling prices for ready mixed concrete and aggregate and canadian cement 
these were partially offset by reduced average selling prices for cement in the us and gypsum drywall 
in  net sales decreased percent percent excluding lafarge florida inc as decreased volumes in most of our product lines  except for gypsum  were only partially offset by price improvements 
see management s discussion of income for additional details 
inflation rates in recent years have not been a significant factor in our net sales or earnings growth 
we continually attempt to offset the effect of inflation by improving operating efficiencies  especially in the areas of productivity  energy costs  and selling and administrative expenses 
we compete with other suppliers of our products in all of our markets 
the ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher prices for our products varies with the level of activity in the construction industry  the number  size and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market 
net cash provided by operations consists of net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and changes in operating working capital 
we are in a capital intensive industry and  as a result  we recognize large amounts of depreciation 
we have used our cash provided by operations to expand our markets  improve the performance of our plants and other operating equipment  and to reduce our net debt position 
capital expenditures and acquisitions totaled  million over the past five years 
these included the construction of new drywall plants in kentucky and florida  acquisition of the newark gypsum drywall plant  cement plant projects to increase production capacity and reduce costs  including the new richmond  british columbia cement plant and the sugar creek  missouri cement plant  the installation of receiving and handling facilities at cement plants for substitute fuels and raw materials  the building and purchasing of additional cement distribution terminals and water transportation facilities to extend markets and improve existing supply networks  the expansion of our cement related products operations  the expansion of asphalt  paving and aggregate operations through the merger with the warren paving materials group  the acquisition of ready mixed concrete plants and aggregate operations  including our acquisition of the presque isle quarry  rocky mountain materials  pine hill materials corp  american readi mix concrete corporation and several other small tuck in acquisitions  and the renewal of the construction materials mobile equipment fleet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency risks 
we have defined strict policies and procedures to measure  manage and monitor our market risk exposures 
our policies do not permit any speculative market position 
we have instituted management rules based on a segregation of operations  financial and administrative control  and risk measurement 

table of contents we use financial instruments only to hedge existing or anticipated financial and commercial exposures 
we undertake this hedging in the over the counter market with a limited number of highly rated counter parties 
our positions in derivative financial instruments are monitored using various techniques  including the fair value approach 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity risk with respect to price changes principally in coal  coke  natural gas  electricity and diesel fuel 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into long term contracts  increasing our use of alternative fuels  or using commodity based derivatives 
we execute commodity based derivatives only for the purpose of hedging the economic exposure to commodity price changes  not for trading or speculative purposes 
by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices  we are exposed to credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counter party to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counter party owes us  which creates credit risk for us 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counter party and  therefore  do not have a credit risk 
we minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with what we believe are high quality counter parties 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices 
we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
as such  a percent change in the commodity prices for hedged items would cause a change on our december  consolidated net assets and the consolidated other comprehensive income by less than million  net of any other impact 
such a change would have no impact on net income as our derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of the fair value change reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
foreign currency risk translation risks the assets  liabilities  income and expenses of our canadian operating entities are denominated in a foreign currency 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars 
thus  assets  liabilities  income and expenses denominated in currencies other than us dollars must be translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate to be included in our financial statements 
if the us dollar increases in value against the canadian dollar  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  income and expenses originally recorded in the canadian dollar will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against the canadian dollar  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  income and expenses originally recorded in canadian dollars will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar has a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our canadian dollar denominated assets  liabilities  income and expenses  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
at december  and for the year then ended  approximately percent of our consolidated net assets and percent of consolidated net income was attributable to subsidiaries that prepare their financial statements in canadian dollars 
as such  a percent change in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate would cause a change on consolidated net assets and consolidated net income by approximately million and million  net of any other impact  respectively 
transaction risks we are subject to limited foreign currency exchange risks as a consequence of commercial exposures related to purchase and sale transactions in currencies other than our operating currencies 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange risks related to transactions is not material 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our debt 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
at december   we had no derivative instruments related to interest rates 
however  on february   we entered into million interest rate swap as disclosed in a separate paragraph below 
our interest rate exposure can be subdivided into the following risks price risk for fixed rate financial assets and liabilities by contracting a fixed rate liability  for example  we are exposed to an opportunity cost in the event of a fall in interest rates 
changes in interest rates impact the market value of fixed rate assets and liabilities  leaving the associated financial income or expense unchanged 
at december   percent of our consolidated indebtedness was at fixed rates 
for a further discussion of our financial policy and interest rate exposure  see the note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements reported in item of part ii of the annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
cash flow risk for floating rate assets and liabilities changes in interest rates have little impact on the market value of floating rate assets and liabilities  but directly influence our future income or expense flows 
we use variable rate debt to finance our operations 
at december   approximately percent of our consolidated indebtedness was at variable rates  which exposes us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
as such  a one percent change in the average interest rate would have caused a change in consolidated net income of less than million  net of any other impact 
interest rate swap in on february   we entered into a million interest rate swap which effectively converts our million bond  maturing in july  from a fixed rate coupon of to a floating rate coupon at six month libor plus a fixed spread of 
the initial interest rate setting is 
subsequent interest settings will result in floating interest rates at a fixed spread of above libor
