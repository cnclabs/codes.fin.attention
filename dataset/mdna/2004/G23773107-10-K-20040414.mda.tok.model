item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our objective is to provide water services in areas where the supply of potable water is scarce and where the use of ro technology to produce potable water is economically feasible 
by focusing on this market  we believe that we can provide a superior financial return to our investors 
to increase share value and maintain dividend payouts in accordance with current company policy  we need to expand our revenues by developing new business opportunities both within our current service areas  and in new areas 
we need to maintain our high operating efficiencies by adhering to our strict equipment maintenance and water loss mitigation programs in order to achieve gross profit margins between and 
we further believe that many caribbean basin and adjacent countries  while being water scarce  also present opportunities for operation of our plants in limited regulatory settings which are less restrictive than the highly regulated markets of north america  which promotes cost effective operation of our equipment 
our business operations and activities after our acquisitions in february  are conducted in five countries the cayman islands  belize  barbados  the british virgin islands and the bahamas 
the recent acquisitions increase our daily water production capacity in the cayman islands and the bahamas and expand our geographic presence to include barbados and the british virgin islands

cayman islands we have been operating our business on grand cayman island since and have been using ro technology to convert seawater to potable water since there is a limited natural supply of fresh water on the cayman islands 
we currently have an exclusive license from the cayman islands government to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman 
prior to our acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited  our cayman islands operations consisted of three reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in grand cayman the governor s harbour plant  the west bay plant and the britannia plant 
the combined capacity of these plants is million us gallons per day 
our pipeline system in the cayman islands covers the seven mile beach and west bay areas of grand cayman and consists of approximately miles of polyvinyl chloride pipe 
retail water sales in grand cayman are made within our licensed area 
table of contents to approximately  customers 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons of water to our retail water customers in grand cayman 
as a result of our recent acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited  we now operate an additional three reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in grand cayman with a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
ocean conversion cayman limited provides water on a take or pay basis to the water authority cayman  a government regulatory agency  under various licenses and agreements 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons of water to our bulk water customer in grand cayman 
desalco limited provides management  engineering and construction services for desalination projects and is the exclusive agent for sales of dweer energy recovery systems for desalination plants in the caribbean basin for the next seven years

we sell water to one customer  belize water services limited  which then distributes the water through its own distribution system to residential  commercial and tourist properties on ambergris caye 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons of water to our bulk water customer in belize 
bahamas prior to our acquisition of operational control of waterfields company limited  our bahamas operations consisted of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in bimini  bahamas 
our bimini plant is capable of producing  us gallons per day and provides potable water to bimini sands resort and to the bimini beach hotel 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons of water to our retail water customer in bimini  bahamas 
we expect the demand for water from our plant in bimini to increase as additional phases are completed at the bimini sands development 
as a result of our acquisition of waterfields company limited  we acquired an additional reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in the bahamas 
waterfields produces potable water from one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in new providence and has a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
waterfields company limited provides water on a take or pay basis to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas under a long term build  own and operate supply agreement 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons of water to our bulk water customer in the bahamas

this plant is operated by desalco barbados ltd  the wholly owned subsidiary of desalco limited 
the plant provides water to the sandy lane resort  and during  we produced approximately million us gallons 

table of contents british virgin islands we recently entered the market in the british virgin islands when our wholly owned subsidiary  desalco limited acquired an equity position and shared management control of ocean conversion bvi ltd  which produces potable water from one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in tortola  british virgin islands 
the plant has a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
ocean conversion bvi ltd 
provides water to the department of water and sewerage of the ministry of communications and works of the government of the british virgin islands 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons of water to our bulk water customer in the british virgin islands 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to trade accounts receivable  intangible assets and goodwill 
our company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our company s consolidated financial statements 
trade accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management continuously evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and record allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of actual write offs which might be experienced 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write off history 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess costs over fair value of the assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimatable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates the possible impairment of goodwill 
management identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit and compares it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the company is required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  the company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount  the impairment loss is recorded 
our annual impairment tests resulted in no goodwill impairment

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in revenue from our retail water retail operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
sales in our primary market in the cayman islands were generally flat during the year  although we did experience an increase in sales of during the fourth quarter of over the same period in the prior year 
revenue from our bulk water bulk operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due to our recent acquisitions of ocean conversion cayman limited and waterfields company limited and was slightly offset by a decrease in our bulk water sales in belize for the year ended december  revenue from services services was  for the year ended december  all services revenues pertain to our recent acquisition of desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd 
other income expenses total other income expenses changed from an expense of  to income of  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was comprised of income and profit sharing from our equity investment in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
and was offset by interest expense related to the loan used to finance our recent acquisitions  amortization of bank fees and the early repayment fees paid on our loan from the european investment bank that was extinguished on june  we expect loan interest costs to decrease because a portion of the proceeds received from our completed equity offering was used to repay our scotiabank six month term loan on july  and we expect amortization of bank fees to decrease because we have fully amortized all fees relating to our bridge financing that was used to complete our recent acquisition 
cost of sales total cost of sales increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in during this same period  our total revenue increased by 
cost of sales of our retail operations decreased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively  while our retail revenue increased by for the year ended december  this decrease in cost of sales resulted primarily from the cancellation of the governor s harbour plant operating contract on february   which decreased our water purchase expense 
we expect our retail cost of sales going forward to remain at this lower percentage of retail revenues 
cost of sales of our bulk operations increased by from  to  for the 
table of contents year ended december  and  respectively  while our bulk revenue increased by for the same period 
this increase in cost of sales resulted almost entirely from the operating costs of ocean conversion cayman limited and waterfields company limited  which were consolidated in our accounts from february  and august  respectively 
it also includes the amortization costs of the intangible assets that were recognized in conjunction with our recent acquisition of ocean conversion cayman limited 
cost of sales of our services reporting segment were  for the year ended december  these relate to our recent acquisition of desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd 
and include the amortization cost of the intangible assets that was recognized in conjunction with our recent acquisition of desalco limited and desalco barbados ltd 
gross profit overall gross profit margin increased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in  for the reasons explained below 
gross profit margin for our retail operations increased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the primary reason for this increase is that our retail cost of sales decreased as a result of the cancellation of the governor s harbour plant operating contract 
gross profit margin for our bulk operations decreased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in in  we incurred additional direct costs in our belize bulk operations for leasing a temporary potable reverse osmosis unit which we operated to meet our customer s water demand while we carried out maintenance on our permanent reverse osmosis units 
we ceased using the plant on september  and we do not expect to incur costs for this plant beyond april we generally sell water to our bulk customers at a lower profit margin than to our retail customers 
gross profit margin for our services reporting segment was for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in general and administrative expenses were at and of total revenue for the year ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our retail operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is comprised primarily of higher insurance premiums  office rent and staff costs 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our bulk operations increased by from  to  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is almost entirely the result of the inclusion of the general and administrative expenses of ocean conversion cayman limited and waterfields company limited 
we expect to reduce general and administrative expenses as we continue to assimilate the administrative functions of our recent acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our services reporting segment were 
table of contents  for the year ended december  this is entirely the result of our recent acquisitions of desalco limited and its wholly owned subsidiary desalco barbados ltd 
we expect to reduce general and administrative expenses as we continue to assimilate the administrative functions of our recent acquisitions 
net income net income increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in we expect future net income to be positively affected because  interest expense decreased after we repaid the bridge financing using the proceeds from our recent equity offering and we fully amortized the bank fees related to this bridge financing on july  and we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease as we continue to assimilate our recent acquisitions 
dividends on january   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on december   on april   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on march   on july   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on june  and on october   we paid a dividend of to shareholders of record on september  we have consistently paid dividends to owners of our ordinary and redeemable preferred shares since we began declaring dividends in our board of directors has established a policy  but not a binding obligation  that we will seek to maintain a dividend pay out ratio in the range of to of net income 
while this policy is subject to modification by our board of directors  we expect to continue increasing our dividends  if our earnings grow 
our payment of any future cash dividends  however  will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  capital demand and other factors  including the condition in our new loan agreement effective february   with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
that dividends be paid only from current cash flows 
on february   our board of directors declared an interim cash dividend of per share  an increase of approximately  payable on april  to shareholders of record on march  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total water sales increased as a result of several factors detailed below 
revenue from our retail water retail operations added  to retail revenue for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in revenues 
the number of us gallons we sold during the year ended december  increased by over the prior year 
this is the result of supplying water to the hyatt hotel and the britannia golf course 
our water sales to customers other than the hyatt hotel and the britannia golf course were essentially flat when compared to the prior year  despite a reduction in tourist air arrivals to the cayman islands due to continued air travel concerns and the downturn of the us economy during the year ended december  revenue from our bulk water bulk operations added  to water sales for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the 
table of contents total increase in revenue 
in june  the automatic inflation adjustment decreased our belize water rates by an average of 
this was more than offset by a increase in the number of us gallons sold for the year ended december  over the prior year 
this increase occurred because during the year ended december   we experienced equipment malfunctions which temporarily reduced the production capacity of our plant by during certain periods in august and september other income expenses total other income expenses changed from income of  to an expense of  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this decrease was a result of the february  termination of the dispute settlement agreement with cayman hotel and golf inc  the owner of the hyatt grand cayman resort and britannia golf course 
cost of sales total cost of sales increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  while water sales revenues increased by for the year ended december  cost of sales of our retail operations increased by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of  compared to an increase of in water sales revenue  over the prior year and represents of the total increase in cost of water sales 
the cost of water sales increased as a result of direct costs incurred to operate the britannia plant in the cayman islands  which was acquired on february  these costs included salaries and benefits for additional staff  equipment maintenance costs  electricity  chemicals and insurance  which will continue now that we operate the britannia plant 
higher insurance costs also increased cost of water sales due to higher premium rates from our insurance provider  and additional insured values following the purchase of the britannia plant and the insurance for the full replacement value of all our reverse osmosis desalination plants 
some of this increase was offset  after the britannia plant was purchased  by a decrease in water purchase costs resulting from lower volume purchases from ocean conversion cayman limited 
we were unable to take full advantage of the lower per gallon production costs of the britannia plant as it only operated at capacity in the eleven months that we owned the britannia plant due to contractual minimum purchase requirements from ocean conversion cayman limited 
cost of sales of our bulk operations increased by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of  compared to a increase in bulk revenues over the prior year and represents of the total increase in total cost of sales 
during the year ended december   we completed scheduled preventive maintenance on a major piece of equipment in belize  which increased our cost of water sales 
also increasing our cost of water sales in were additional repairs and maintenance on the existing reverse osmosis equipment 
during the year ended december   we also settled various claims for compensation made by our customer in belize in march these claims were the result of our equipment failures that occurred in august and september and a minor miscalculation in the annual inflation adjustment formula in our contract 
the miscalculation dated back to november  which was prior to our acquisition of belize water limited  and upon correction  reduced our unit rate for water to our customer by per  us gallons 
gross profit overall gross profit margins decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents gross profit margins for our retail operations decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for this decrease are i approximately two thirds of the water produced by our britannia plant in the cayman islands was sold to the hyatt hotel and britannia golf course at a lower rate than our standard commercial water rate  ii due to flat water sales to other customers  we were only able to utilize approximately of the production capacity of the britannia plant and iii we were not able to acquire water from our lowest priced source as a result of the minimum water purchase obligation we have with ocean conversion cayman limited 
gross profit margins for our bulk operations increased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reason for the increase in the gross profit margin is the increased revenues from the increase in the number of us gallons sold over the prior year were greater than in increase in cost of sales due to the settlement costs with belize water services ltd 
as discussed above and additional repairs and maintenance on the reverse osmosis equipment in belize 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses increased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
indirect expenses were at and of total revenue for the year ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our retail operations increased by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in general and administrative expenses 
we attribute this increase to our accounting for stock compensation costs  unanticipated professional fees relating to our december  audit and form k review together with increased insurance premiums on our commercial and directors and officers insurance 
stock compensation costs increased  for the year ended december  as a result of an increase in our shares price during the last fiscal quarter 
unanticipated professional fees relating to our december  audit and k review were  and our commercial and directors and officers insurance increased by  we also had additional reporting costs in due to increased demand for our annual report and proxy statements 
these increases were mostly offset by a reduction in bonus costs and subscription costs for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
general and administrative expenses related or allocated to our bulk operations increased by  for the year ended december   which is an increase of over the prior year and represents of the total increase in indirect expenses 
during the year ended december   we had additional costs as a result of higher insurance premiums and increased costs to repatriate funds 
net income net income decreased by from  to  for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of the factors indicated above 
dividends in december  we increased our per share dividend from to per quarter and have paid dividends in this amount during the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview for the year ended december   we generated cash primarily from the sale of our shares and through loans and credit facilities and to a lesser extent  from our operations in the cayman islands  the bahamas  belize and barbados and from dividends and profit sharing rights from our equity investment in the british virgin islands 
cash flow is dependent upon the timely receipt of customer payments  operating expenses  the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases excluding automatic adjustments to our rates for inflation and electricity costs  and various factors affecting tourism in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  barbados and the bahamas  such as weather conditions and the economy 
we use cash to fund our operations in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  barbados and the bahamas  to fund capital projects  to expand our infrastructure  to pay dividends  to repay principal on our loans  to repurchase our shares when appropriate and to take advantage of new investment opportunities which expand our operations 
operating activities cash generated from operating activities for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
we generate cash through the utilization of our existing plants  equipment and resources in all segments of the business  minimization of water losses and operating efficiencies created by our management team 
we believe that our administrative staff will be able to manage all our combined operations so that our indirect costs will not increase in proportion to revenues

we intend to finance these projects using cash from operations on february   we entered into a loan agreement with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
to finance the recent acquisitions and refinance our existing debt 
the facilities are comprised of the following million revolving line of credit bearing interest at the floating base rate as established by cayman island class a licensed banks from time to time

this facility was fully repaid by the proceeds from our equity offering on july  we have used the proceeds from these facilities to refinance our existing debt  for working capital and to finance our recent acquisitions 
as of december   we have an outstanding balance of  on our scotiabank loan facilities 
we are required to make monthly payments of interest for all borrowings under the revolving line of credit and quarterly payments of interest for all amounts drawn down under the two term loans 
we are obligated to make equal quarterly payments of principal under the seven year term loan 
we have collateralized all borrowings under the three facilities by providing scotiabank with a first lien on all of our assets  including the capital stock of subsidiaries and investment in equity we acquired in our recent acquisitions 
the loan agreement for the three facilities contains standard terms and conditions for similar bank loans made in the cayman islands  including acceleration of the repayment of all borrowings either upon the demand of scotiabank cayman islands ltd

we are not promising to make any public announcement when we think forward looking statements in this annual report are no longer accurate whether as a result of new information  what actually happens in the future or for any other reason 
important matters that may affect what will actually happen include  but are not limited to tourism and weather conditions in the areas we service  our ability to manage  integrate and realize the benefits from our recent acquisitions  scheduled new construction within our operating areas  the economies of the us and the areas we service  regulatory matters  availability of capital to repay a substantial portion of our bank debt and for expansion of our operations  and other factors described in the risk factors section below as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
risk factors we have described for you below some risks which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our exclusive license for our service area in the cayman islands may not be renewed in the future and requires that we obtain prior approval for any rate increase for reasons other than inflation 
in the cayman islands  we presently operate as a public water utility under an exclusive license originally issued to us in december by the government of the cayman islands 
our existing license expires on july  if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those which the government offers to a third party 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the government will renew our license or that we will be able to negotiate a new license on satisfactory terms 
we would retain ownership of our production infrastructure and substantially all of our distribution infrastructure if our license were not renewed 
under our existing license  we must obtain prior approval from the cayman islands government to increase our rates for any reason other than inflation 
our ability to raise our rates is limited by this requirement  including potential delays and costs involved in obtaining government approval for a rate increase 
failure to obtain adequate rate increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we rely on water supply agreements with our customers in the cayman islands  belize  the bahamas and barbados which  upon their expiration  may not be renewed or may be renegotiated on less favorable terms to us 
we presently operate as bulk water suppliers under water sales agreements in the cayman islands with our customer the water authority cayman  in belize with our customer  the belize water services limited  in the bahamas with our customers  the water sewerage corporation and south bimini international ltd 
and in barbados with our customer sandy lane properties ltd 
upon expiration  these agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed on less favorable terms 

table of contents termination of our exclusive distributorship agreement with dweer technology ltd 
would eliminate one competitive advantage that we presently have over our competition in obtaining new plants in the caribbean basin 
our wholly owned subsidiary  desalco limited  is currently the exclusive distributor in the caribbean basin for the dweer system produced by dweer technology ltd 
for use in reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants 
as a result  none of our competitors are able to offer this technology when bidding for new reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants in the caribbean basin 
as the dweer system is one of the most energy efficient recovery systems of its kind  the distributorship agreement with dweer technology ltd 
gives us a unique competitive advantage 
if the distributorship agreement were terminated or not renewed on equally favorable terms  we would lose this competitive advantage  and it may be more difficult for us to obtain new contracts for plants in the caribbean basin 
the british virgin islands water and sewerage department has taken the position that our water supply agreement is operating on a month to month basis 
we have accepted the position of the british virgin islands water and sewerage department that ocean conversion bvi ltd 
s existing water supply arrangement the british virgin islands is in force on a month to month basis until negotiations for a definitive agreement are finalized 
in may  the british virgin islands government did not make a required buyout payment of million for the baughers bay plant and has taken the position that the water supply agreement continues on a month to month basis 
thus  it is possible  but in our opinion unlikely  that the government could cease purchasing water at any time 
while ocean conversion bvi ltd 
is currently attempting to negotiate a new water supply agreement  there is no guarantee such agreement will be obtained  or if obtained  would be on terms favorable to ocean conversion bvi ltd 
cessation of the government water purchases  or failure to negotiate a new agreement on terms favorable to us  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the new assets that we acquired in the recent acquisitions 
increasing the size of our company in a relatively short period of time has placed a significant strain on our management resources 
management may be required to spend additional time and money on integration that would otherwise be spent developing our business and services and may not be successful in integrating the acquired assets into our current operations 
for example  integrating our new assets requires us to expand our management information systems and control our operating expenses 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the acquisitions will provide us with the expected benefits 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the acquisitions will not have a negative impact on our business and results of operation 
the costs of integrating our new assets may affect our ability to pay dividends 
we have historically sought to pay cash dividends to our shareholders out of our net income on a quarterly basis if funds are available 
the costs associated with integrating the new assets into our company  however  may reduce our net income 
if our net income is reduced  we will have fewer funds available to pay dividends 
in addition  our bank loan agreement with scotiabank cayman islands ltd 
requires that we pay dividends from current cash flows 
our business is affected by tourism  weather conditions  the economies of the locations where we provide service and the us and european economies 
tourist arrivals and weather conditions within our operating areas affect the demand for our water to a greater extent in the cayman islands and in belize than in the bahamas  the british virgin islands and barbados 
in the cayman islands and belize  the highest demand is normally in the first two quarters of each calendar year 
the lowest demand for water occurs in the third quarter of each calendar year 
a significant percentage of tourists visiting the cayman islands and belize come from the us or certain european countries 
in addition  development activity in our service areas in the cayman islands is significantly impacted by the us economy 
accordingly  a significant downturn in tourist arrivals to the cayman islands or in the us or european economies for any reason would be detrimental to our revenues and operating results 

table of contents after the events of september   tourism decreased in the cayman islands and is only gradually returning to historical levels 
additional terrorist activities in the united states  europe or in areas served by us or extended hostilities in the persian gulf would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas 
even though we have an exclusive license for our present operating area in the cayman islands and supply agreements in the cayman islands  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  barbados and belize  our ability to expand our operating areas is often subject to the approval of the respective governments in each location 
further  part of our long term growth strategy is to expand our water supply and distribution operations to other locations outside of the cayman islands  the bahamas  barbados  the british virgin islands and belize 
our expansion into new locations depends on our ability to obtain necessary permits  licenses and approvals to operate in new territories 
we may not obtain these necessary permits  licenses and approvals in a timely and cost efficient manner  or at all 
our expansion to territories outside of our current operating areas includes significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following regulatory risks  including government relations difficulties  local regulations and currency controls  risks related to operating in foreign countries  including political instability  reliance on local economies  environmental or geographical problems  shortages of materials  immigration restrictions and skilled labor  risks related to development of new operations  including assessing the demand for water  engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled  and risks relating to greater competition in these new territories  including the ability of our competitors to gain or retain market share by reducing prices 
even if our expansion plans are successful  we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we cannot assure you that any new operations outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not negatively affect our overall profitability 
we do not own a majority interest in ocean conversion bvi ltd 
we recently acquired of the voting shares of ocean conversion bvi ltd 
which allows us to appoint three of the six directors of that company 
sage water holdings bvi limited  which owns the remaining of the voting shares  is entitled to appoint the remaining three directors 
if there is a tied vote of the directors on any matter  the president of the caribbean water and wastewater association is entitled to appoint a temporary director to break the tie 
as a result  we have to share the management of ocean conversion bvi ltd 
with sage water holdings bvi limited 
although we provide management and engineering services to ocean conversion bvi ltd 
we do not fully control the operations of the company 
our operations in the caribbean could be harmed by hurricanes 
a significant hurricane could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers  including the large tourist properties in these areas 
this would result in decreased revenues and profits from water sales until our damaged equipment and properties are repaired and our customers and the tourism industry 
table of contents returned to the status quo before the hurricane 
we do not insure our underground water distribution system on the cayman islands 
contamination to our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues 
our processed water may become contaminated by naturally occurring or man made compounds and events 
in the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the supply of that water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
our inability to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost effective manner may have an adverse effect on our revenues 
in addition  in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks in new york  washington  dc and pennsylvania  we have taken steps to heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
while we are not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  we have and will continue to take security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
it is possible  however  that we would not be in a position to control the outcome or the costs of such events should they occur  which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
we could be negatively affected by potential government actions and regulations 
any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations  including but not limited to restricting foreign ownership of our company  providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government  providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government  providing for different water quality standards  resulting in unilateral changes to or renegotiation of our exclusive licenses  or causing currency exchange fluctuations or devaluations or changes in tax laws 
we rely heavily on the efforts of several key employees 
our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers 
in particular  the loss of the services of jeffrey parker  our chairman of the board  or fredrick mctaggart  our president and chief executive officer  could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success 
although messrs 
parker and mctaggart have entered into three year employment agreements which may be extended every year for an additional one year term  we cannot guarantee that mr 
parker or mr 
mctaggart will continue to work for us during the term of their agreements 
except for messrs 
parker and f 
mctaggart  none of our other employees have entered into non compete agreements with us 
provisions in our articles of association and an option deed adopted by our board of directors may discourage a change in control of our company and may make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares 
our articles of association include provisions which may discourage or prevent a change in control of our company 
for instance  our board of directors consists of three groups 
each group serves a staggered term of three years before the directors in the group are up for re 
table of contents election 
also  our board of directors may refuse to register any transfer of shares on our books for any reason 
we have also adopted an option deed  which is similar to a poison pill 
the option deed will discourage a change in control of our company by causing substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire our company on terms not approved by the board of directors 
the option deed will expire on july  as a result of these provisions  which discourage or prevent an unfriendly or unapproved change in control of our company  our shareholders may not have an opportunity to sell their ordinary shares at a higher market price  which  at least temporarily  typically accompanies attempts to acquire control of a company through a tender offer  open market purchase or otherwise 
there may be a risk of variation in currency exchange rates 
although we report our results in united states dollars  the majority of our revenue is earned in cayman islands dollars  belizean dollars  bahamian dollars and barbados dollars 
all of the currencies in our operating areas have been fixed to the united states dollar for over years 
as a result  we do not intend to hedge against any exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
if any of these fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate  however  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the united states may be difficult to obtain 
service of process on our company and our directors and officers  fourteen out of sixteen of whom reside outside the united states  may be difficult to obtain within the united states 
also  since substantially all of our assets are currently located outside the united states  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible 
there is no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments between the united states and the cayman islands  so foreign judgments originating from the united states are not directly enforceable in the cayman islands 
a prevailing party in a united states proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the cayman islands using the united states judgment as evidence of the party s claim 
a prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the cayman islands  subject to available defenses in the cayman islands courts  including  but not limited to  the lack of competent jurisdiction in the united states courts  lack of due service of process in the united states proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the united states judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
depending on the nature of damages awarded  civil liabilities under the securities act of or the securities exchange act of for original actions instituted outside the cayman islands may or may not be enforceable 
for example  a united states judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the cayman islands for example  treble damages  which would probably be regarded as penalties  would not likely be enforceable under any circumstances 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk credit risk we are not exposed to significant credit risk on retail customer accounts in the cayman islands  and bimini  bahamas  as our policy is to cease supply of water to customers whose accounts are more than days overdue 
our main exposure to credit risk is from our bulk water sales customers in belize  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  barbados and the cayman islands 
in addition  the entire balance of our loan receivable is due from the water authority cayman 
interest rate risk as of december   we had loans outstanding totaling  all of which bear interest at various lending rates such as libor  cayman island s prime rate or nassau prime rate 
we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that any of these lending rates change 
foreign exchange risk all of our foreign currencies have fixed exchanged rates to the us dollar 
if any of these fixed exchange rates become a floating exchange rate  however  our results of operation could be adversely affected
