item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a leading supplier of a broad range of products used in a substantial number of aerospace and defense platforms 
we also are a major supplier of subsystems on many platforms  including those for secure communication networks  mobile satellite communications  information security systems  shipboard communications  naval power systems  fuzes and safety and arming devices for missiles and munitions  microwave assemblies for radars and missiles  telemetry and instrumentation  and airport security systems 
we also are a prime system contractor for aircraft modernization and maintenance  isr collection platforms  simulation and training  and government systems support services 
the substantial majority of our sales are generated using written contractual arrangements 
the contracts require us to design  develop  manufacture  modify  test and integrate complex aerospace and electronic equipment and to provide related engineering and technical services according to specifications provided by our customers 
our primary customer is the dod 
for the year ended december   sales directly to the dod and indirect sales to the dod through its prime contractors and subcontractors provided  million  or of our consolidated sales 
our other customers include certain us government intelligence agencies  major aerospace and defense contractors  foreign governments  commercial customers and certain other us federal  state and local government agencies 
our objective is to grow our sales organically and through acquisitions and to improve our profitability 
to achieve these objectives we intend to expand our share of existing programs and participate in new programs by leveraging the strong relationships that we have developed with the dod  several other us government agencies and all of the major us defense prime contractors 
we expect to continue to benefit from the outsourcing of subsystems  components and products by prime contractors 
we plan to continue to align our research and development  manufacturing and new business efforts to complement our customers requirements and to provide state of the art products 
we plan to maintain a diversified and broad business mix with limited reliance on any single program  a favorable balance of cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts  a significant follow on business and an attractive customer profile 
a significant portion of our growth strategy is to selectively acquire companies or assets that complement and enhance our existing businesses 
see acquisitions below 
we have four reportable segments secure communications isr  training  simulation support services  aviation products aircraft modernization  and specialized products 
our secure communications isr segment provides products and services for the global isr market as well as secure  high data rate communications systems and equipment primarily for military and other us government reconnaissance and surveillance applications 
we believe our systems and products are critical elements for a substantial number of major communication  command and control  intelligence gathering and space systems 
our systems and products are used to connect a variety of airborne  space  ground and sea based communication systems and are used in the transmission  processing  recording  monitoring and dissemination functions of these communication systems 
our training  simulation support services segment produces training systems and related support services  and provides a wide range of engineering development services and integration support  a full range of teaching  training  logistics and communication software support services  crisis management software and custom ballistic targets 
our aviation products aircraft modernization segment provides our tcas products  cockpit voice  flight data and cruise ship hardened voyage recorders  ruggedized custom displays and specialized aircraft modernization  upgrade and maintenance services 
our specialized products segment provides naval warfare products  telemetry  instrumentation  space and navigation products  premium fuzing products  security and surveillance systems  training devices and motion simulators  electro optic surveillance systems  ruggedized commercial off the shelf technology and microwave components 
in recent years  domestic and geo political developments have significantly affected the markets for defense systems  products and services 
the events of september  created uncertainty and exposed vulnerabilities in the security and the overall defense of the us homeland 
in the conclusions of the us quadrennial defense review qdr  completed during  there was a fundamental and philosophical shift in focus from a threat based model to one that emphasizes the capabilities needed to defeat a full spectrum of adversaries 
transforming the nation s defense posture to a capabilities based approach involves creating the ability for a more flexible response  with greater force mobility  stronger space capabilities  missile defense  improved and network centric communications and information systems security and an increased emphasis on homeland defense 
the afghanistan and iraq wars have confirmed several of the conclusions reached in the qdr and have also resulted in increased dod spending  primarily for war operations 
the fiscal year fiscal year beginning october   or fy dod budget  excluding the iraq and afghanistan war supplemental appropriations  was billion  an increase of over the fiscal year fy dod budget 
on february   the bush administration released its current future year defense plan fydp for the fiscal year fy to fiscal year fy  and its dod budget request for fy of billion 
the fy budget request indicates an increase of over the fy budget 
we believe the dod investment account  which is comprised of the procurement and research  development  test and evaluation rdt e components of the dod budget  is a better indicator of dod spending applicable to defense contractors than the total dod budget because it generally represents the amounts that are expended for military hardware  services and technology 
the investment account increased in fy over fy  and the current fydp indicates a compounded annual growth rate of from fy to fy however  the dod investment account is not the only indicator of revenue growth potential for the defense industry  because i the dod budget and dod spending for all defense weapons platforms and programs do not grow or decline at the same rate  ii there are timing differences between dod budget authority and actual dod spending  iii an individual defense contractor s revenue growth potential will be affected by its participation on the various weapons platforms and programs  including its individual performance on specific programs  and iv changing military needs and program performance can affect whether specific programs receive continued funding or whether they are cancelled 
additionally  the operations and maintenance o m account of the dod budget  which is billion for fy  represents another source of funding applicable to defense contractors 
we estimate that billion to billion of the o m account is expended annually as awards to defense contractors 
the table below presents a summary of the current fydp for the total dod budget and investment account  including actual amounts for fy and for fy

budget amounts exclude the fy and fy supplemental appropriations for the war operations in iraq and afghanistan 
over the past several years  the dod budgets have experienced increased focus on command  control  communications  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance c isr  precision guided weapons  unmanned aerial vehicles uavs  network centric communications  special operations forces sof and missile defense 
in addition  the dod philosophy has focused on a transformation strategy that balances modernization and recapitalization or upgrading existing platforms while enhancing readiness and joint operations 
as a result  defense budget program allocations continue to favor advanced information technologies related to command  control and communications c and isr 
furthermore  the dod s emphasis on system interoperability  force multipliers and providing battlefield commanders with real time data is increasing the electronic content of nearly all major military procurement and research programs 
as a result  it is expected that the dod s budget for communications and defense electronics will continue to grow 
we believe l is well positioned to benefit from the expected increased spending in those areas 
while there is no assurance that the requested dod budget increases  particularly those for the investment account  will continue to be approved by congress  the current outlook is one of increased dod spending  which we believe will continue to positively affect l s future orders and sales and favorably affect our future operating profits and cash flows because of increased sale volumes 
conversely  a decline in the budget for the dod investment account would generally have a negative affect on future orders  sales  operating profits and cash flows of defense contractors  including l  depending on the weapons platforms and programs affected by such budget reductions 
however  l believes that its businesses are significant participants in the sectors of the dod investment account and dod o m account that are the highest priority for us military transformation  and we believe that they will continue to be  even in a declining dod budget environment 
in addition  increased emphasis on us homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as security systems  information security  crisis management  preparedness and prevention services  and civilian security operations 
all of our us government contracts are subject to audit and various cost controls  and include standard provisions for termination for the convenience of the us government 
multiyear us government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable 
foreign government contracts generally include comparable provisions relating to termination for the convenience of the relevant foreign government 
acquisitions a significant component of our growth strategy has been to enhance our existing product base through selective acquisitions that will add new products in areas that complement our present technologies 
we intend to continue acquiring select smaller publicly and privately owned companies  as well as non core aerospace and defense businesses of larger companies  that i exhibit significant market position s in their business area s  ii offer products that complement and or extend our product offerings  and iii display positive sales  earnings and cash flow prospects 
the table below summarizes the more significant acquisitions that we have completed during  and during we used cash of  million to acquire businesses

these earnouts represent potential additional purchase price amounts that are contingent upon the post acquisition financial performance of the acquired business 
the amounts payable in have been finalized as of december   and  accordingly  have been included in other current liabilities  with a corresponding increase to goodwill at december  the contingent amounts for periods after will be recorded as an increase to goodwill for the acquisition if they become payable 
all earnout payments are reported as cash paid for acquisition of businesses within investing activities on the statement of cash flows in the period of the payment 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and costs and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to i contract revenues and profit recognition  ii market values for inventories reported at lower of cost or market  iii pension and postretirement benefit obligations  iv valuation of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  v income taxes  including the valuations of deferred tax assets  vi litigation reserves  and vii environmental obligations 
actual amounts will differ from these estimates 
we believe that critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate  and we could reasonably have used different estimates  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies contain the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
contract revenue recognition and contract estimates 
the substantial majority of our sales require us to design  develop  manufacture  modify  test and integrate complex aerospace and electronic equipment  and to provide related engineering and technical services according to specifications provided by our customers 
these sales are transacted using written contractual arrangements or contracts  which are generally either fixed price  cost reimbursable or time and material 
these contracts are within the scope of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop and accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts arb 
in addition  cost reimbursable contracts are also specifically within the scope of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  section a  government contracts  cost plus fixed fee contracts arb 
substantially all of our cost reimbursable and time and material contracts are with the us government  primarily with the department of defense 
certain of our contracts with the us government are multi year contracts that are funded annually by the customer  and sales on these multi year contracts are based on amounts appropriated funded by the us government 
sales and profits on fixed price contracts are recognized using percentage of completion methods of accounting 
sales and profits on fixed price production contracts whose units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process are recorded as units are delivered based on their selling prices the units of delivery method 
sales and profits on other fixed price contracts are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract for each contract the cost to cost method 
under the percentage of completion methods of accounting  a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance  which can exceed one year 
accounting for the sales on a fixed price contract requires the preparation of estimates of the total contract revenue  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s statement of work  and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss at completion on a contract is equal to the difference between the total estimated contract revenue and the total estimated cost at completion 
under the units of delivery percentage of completion method  sales on a fixed price contract are recorded as the units are delivered during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units 
under the cost to cost percentage of completion method  sales on a fixed price contract are recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of cumulative costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion  multiplied by i the total estimated contract revenue  less ii the cumulative sales recognized in prior periods 
the profit recorded on a contract in any period using either the units of delivery method or cost to cost method is equal to i the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative sales recognized  less ii the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract 
in the case of a contract for which the total estimated costs exceed the total estimated revenues  a loss arises  and a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period that it becomes evident  and the unrecoverable costs on a loss contract that are expected to be incurred in future periods are recorded as a component of other current liabilities entitled estimated cost in excess of estimated contract value to complete contracts in process 
adjustments to original estimates for a contract s revenue  estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
sales on cost reimbursable type contracts are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract and become billable to the customer  at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs 
the estimated profit on a cost reimbursable contract is generally fixed or variable based on the contract fee arrangement 
sales on time and material type contracts are recognized at an amount equal to the direct labor hours incurred multiplied by the contractual fixed rate per hour  plus the actual costs of material and other direct non labor costs 
on a time and material contract the fixed hourly rates include amounts for the cost of direct labor  indirect contract costs and profit 
cost reimbursable or time and material contracts generally contain less estimation risks than fixed price contracts 
the impact of revisions in profit estimates for all types of contracts are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured 
the revisions in contract estimates  if significant  can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows  as well as our valuations of contracts in process 
for the year ended december  sales on fixed price contracts recognized using the units of delivery percentage of completion method accounted for approximately of total sales  sales on fixed price contracts recognized using the cost to cost percentage of completion method accounted for approximately of total sales  sales on cost reimbursable contracts accounted for approximately of total sales  and time and material contracts accounted for approximately of total sales 
the remaining of sales for the year ended december   pertain to fixed price revenue arrangements principally with commercial customers  which are not within the scope of sop  arb or arb and are recorded as products are delivered or when services are performed  in accordance with sec sab no 
 revenue recognition sab goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  l allocates the cost of its acquired businesses commonly referred to as the purchase price allocation to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as part of the purchase price allocations for l s acquired businesses  identifiable intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights  or if they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  unless the intangible asset is comprised of the assembled workforce of the acquired business 
generally  the substantial majority of the intangible assets from the businesses that l acquires are derived from the intellectual capital of the management  administrative  scientific  engineering and technical employees of the acquired businesses 
the success of l s businesses is primarily dependent on the management  contracting  engineering and technical skills and knowledge of l s employees  rather than productive capital machinery and equipment 
generally  patents  trademarks and licenses are not material to our acquired businesses 
furthermore  our us government contracts generally permit other companies to use our patents in most domestic work performed by such other companies for the us government 
therefore  the substantial majority of the intangible assets for l s acquired businesses are recognized as goodwill 
the values assigned to acquired identifiable intangible assets for customer relationships and technology are determined  as of the date of acquisition  based on estimates and judgements regarding expectations for the estimated future after tax cash flows from those assets over their lives  including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales  less a cost of capital charge  all of which is discounted to present value 
if actual future after tax cash flows differ significantly from their estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the identifiable intangible assets to their realizable values 
the value assigned to goodwill equals the amount of the purchase price of the business acquired in excess of the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable acquired assets  both tangible and intangible  less liabilities assumed 
at december   l had goodwill of  million and identifiable intangible assets of million 
l reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested  at a minimum  annually for each reporting unit using a two step process 
a reporting unit is an operating segment  as defined in paragraph of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or a component of an operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed 
two or more components of an operating segment may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
the first step is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill to measure the impairment loss 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation approach  and is dependent on estimates for future sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization  income tax payments  working capital changes  and capital expenditures  as well as  expected growth rates for cash flows and long term interest rates  all of which are impacted by economic conditions related to the industries in which we operate as well as conditions in the us capital markets 
a decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
pension plan and postretirement benefit plan obligations 
the obligations for our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans and the related annual costs of employee benefits are calculated based on several long term assumptions  including discount rates for employee benefit liabilities  rates of return on plan assets  expected annual rates for salary increases for employee participants in the case of pension plans  and expected annual increases in the costs of medical and other health care benefits in the case of postretirement benefit obligations 
these long term assumptions are subject to revision based on changes in interest rates  financial market conditions  expected versus actual returns on plan assets  participant mortality rates and other actuarial assumptions  including future rates of salary increases  benefit formulas and levels  and rates of increase in the costs of benefits 
changes in the assumptions  if significant  can materially affect the amount of annual net periodic benefit costs recognized in our results of operations from one year to the next  the liabilities for the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans  and our annual cash requirements to fund these plans 
valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  including million for loss carryforwards and million for tax credit carryforwards which are subject to various limitations and will expire if unused within their respective carryforward periods 
deferred income taxes are determined separately for each of our tax paying entities in each tax jurisdiction 
the future realization of our deferred income tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law  and to a lesser extent  our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies 
based on our estimates of the amounts and timing of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  we believe that l will be able to realize its deferred tax assets 
a change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income  or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies  could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets  and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
our results of operations for the periods presented are impacted significantly by our acquisitions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our acquisitions 
presentation of sales and costs and expenses 
l presents its sales and costs and expenses in two categories on the statement of operations  contracts  primarily us government and commercial  primarily products 
this categorization is based on how revenue is recognized 
sales and costs and expenses for l s businesses that are primarily us government contractors are presented as contracts  primarily us government 
the sales for l s us government contractor businesses are transacted using written contractual arrangements for products and services according to the specifications provided by the customer and are within the scope of sop  arb and arb sales reported under contracts  primarily us government also include certain sales by l s us government contractor businesses transacted using contracts for domestic and foreign commercial customers  which also are within the scope of sop and arb sales and costs and expenses for l s businesses whose customers are primarily commercial business enterprises are presented as commercial  primarily products 
these sales are recognized in accordance with sab no 
 and are not within the scope of sop  arb or arb l s commercial businesses are substantially comprised of aviation communication surveillance systems acss  aviation recorders  microwave components  detection systems and avionics systems 
the tables below provide two presentations of selected statement of operations data for l the first table presents the selected data segregated between l s us government contractor businesses and l s commercial businesses

operating margin is equal to operating income as a percentage of sales 
sales are after intersegment eliminations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  consolidated sales increased by  million  or  to  million for from sales of  million for the increase in consolidated sales from acquisitions was million  or 
organic sales growth for our defense businesses was  or million  and was driven by continued strong demand for secure communications and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr systems and products  aircraft modernization  simulation and training services  government services  and an increase in shipments of naval power equipment 
organic sales for our commercial businesses declined by  or million  due to the continued weakness in the aviation and communications markets 
sales for explosives detection systems eds decreased million primarily because the initial installation of eds at major us airports by the us transportation security administration tsa was completed by the end of consolidated organic sales growth  excluding the eds business  from both periods was 
consolidated organic sales growth for all of l s businesses  including the decline for the eds business  was million  or 
we define organic sales growth  as the increase or decrease in sales for the current period compared to the prior period  excluding the increase in sales attributable to acquired businesses to the extent the acquired businesses were not included in l s results of operations for the entire current period and prior period 
our defense businesses are comprised of our us government contractor businesses  other than our eds business  all of which are presented under contracts  primarily us government 
sales from contracts  primarily us government  which comprises our defense businesses and our eds business  increased by million  or  to  million for from  million for the increase in sales from acquired businesses was million  or 
the acquired businesses include is  telos  comcept  tma  electron devices  ruggedized command control  westwood  wescam and ship analytics  which were acquired in and aeromet  klein  mas  vertex and certain defense and aerospace assets of ipicom  inc  which were acquired during organic sales growth for l s government businesses was million  or  primarily because of higher sales volume from our defense businesses for isr and secure communications systems and products  aircraft modernization  communications software and engineering support services  training services  navigation products and naval power equipment 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales volume primarily from our eds business  and to a lesser extent  from our fuzing products  training devices  undersea warfare products and display systems 
sales from commercial  primarily products increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase in sales from acquired businesses was million  or 
the acquired businesses include detection systems  imc and wolf coach  which were acquired in and avionics systems  which was acquired during organic sales for l s commercial businesses declined by  or million  due primarily to the lower revenues for aviation and communications products caused by continued weak demand in those commercial markets 
consolidated costs and expenses increased by million to  million for from  million for  consistent with the increase in sales 
costs and expenses for contracts  primarily us government increased by million to  million for from  million for approximately of the increase is attributable to our acquired businesses 
the remaining increase is primarily attributed to organic sales growth from our defense businesses for isr and secure communications systems and products  aircraft modernization  communications software and engineering support services  training services  navigation products and naval power equipment 
these increases were partially offset by declines from our eds business  fuzing products  training devices and display systems due to lower volume 
cost of sales for l s us government contractor businesses include selling  general and administrative sg a  independent research and development irad and bid and proposal b p costs 
these sg a  irad and b p costs are allowable indirect contract costs that are allocated to our us government contracts in accordance with us government regulations 
we report sg a  irad and b p costs allocated to us government contracts as costs of sales when the related contract sales are recognized  rather than account for them as period expenses 
sg a  irad and b p costs included in cost of sales for contracts  primarily us government were million  or of sales for  compared to million  or of sales for see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
costs and expenses for commercial  primarily products increased by million to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to increased sales attributable to our acquired businesses  as well as a million provision for bad debt and inventory for the primewave communications business 
sg a expenses increased by million to million or of sales for from million or of sales for the increase was primarily attributable to acquired businesses and increased costs for security products due to maintenance costs associated with detection systems placed in service 
this increase was partially offset by lower sg a expenses at the primewave communications business and our commercial communications products businesses due to cost and expense reductions 
research and development r d expenses increased by million to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to the avionics systems acquired business and development expenses for cargo security products  partially offset by lower r d expenses incurred at the primewave communications business because of cost and expense reductions 
consolidated operating income increased by million to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to higher sales from all of our segments 
consolidated operating margin increased slightly by percentage points to for from for the changes in the operating margins for our segments are discussed below 
operating income for contracts  primarily us government increased by million to million for from million for operating margin increased by percentage points to for from for the increase in operating margin is due to organic sales growth and cost improvements for isr and secure communications systems and products and naval power equipment 
operating income for commercial  primarily products increased by million to million for from million for operating margin improved by percentage points to for from for the improvement was primarily due to lower losses from certain commercial businesses due to cost and expense reductions and higher margins from the avionics systems acquired business 
these increases were partially offset by lower margins on commercial aviation products and microwave components due to lower sales volume and higher development expenses for cargo security products 
interest expense increased by million to million for from million for the increase is attributable to the higher average outstanding debt during and lower savings from fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements of million 
interest and other income decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was due to lower interest income earned because of lower average cash and cash equivalents balances  a loss of million recorded related to the sale of the commercial broadband test equipment assets of our celerity business and an increase in losses on our investments accounted for using the equity method during compared to the period includes a charge of million million after tax  or per diluted share for the early retirement of million of our senior subordinated notes due see liquidity and capital resources below 
the period includes a charge of million million after tax  or per diluted share for the early retirement of million of our senior subordinated notes due in accordance with sfas no 
 the debt retirement charge  which was classified as an extraordinary item in the prior year presentation  has been reclassified as a component of income from continuing operations 
minority interest decreased by million to million for from million for because of lower net income for aviation communications and surveillance systems acss due to lower sales caused by continued weakness in the commercial aviation market and higher product development expenses 
the income tax provision for is based on an effective income tax rate of  compared with an effective income tax rate of for with respect to the expected effective income tax rate for compared to  the current us federal research and experimentation r e tax credit is scheduled to expire on june  if the r e tax credit is not renewed  l s effective income tax rate would increase 
the r e tax credit lowered l s effective income tax rate by points

the increase in sales from the telos  tma and ship analytics acquired businesses  which were all acquired in  was million 
operating income increased by million to million for from million for because of higher sales  which were partially offset by lower operating margin 
operating margin declined by percentage points to for from for the decrease was primarily due to higher sales from cost reimbursable type and time and material type contracts  which generally are less profitable than fixed priced type contracts 
margins increased by percentage points from acquired businesses 
aviation products aircraft modernization sales within our aviation products aircraft modernization segment increased by million  or  to  million for from million for organic sales growth was million  or  primarily due to million for aircraft modernization and modification driven by dod demand 
this increase was partially offset by volume declines of million for commercial aviation products caused by the continued weakness in the commercial aviation markets and volume declines of million primarily for display systems due to the timing of contractual shipments 
the increase in sales from acquired businesses was million 
the acquired businesses include is  which was acquired in  and avionics systems  mas and vertex  which were acquired in operating income increased by million to million for from million for because of higher aircraft modernization sales  which were partially offset by lower sales for commercial aviation products and lower operating margin 
operating margin declined by percentage points to for from for volume declines for commercial aviation products  which have higher margins than aircraft modification sales  decreased operating margin by percentage points 
similarly  margins decreased by percentage points primarily due to volume growth for aircraft modernization  which earns lower margins than commercial aviation products 
these decreases were partially offset by the avionics systems and mas acquired businesses  which increased margin by percentage points 
specialized products sales within our specialized products segment increased by million  or  to  million for from  million for organic sales declined  or million  or million  or excluding the decline for eds 
eds sales declined by million discussed below 
volume declined by million for fuzing and acoustic undersea warfare products and training devices because of certain contracts approaching their scheduled completion and the timing of sales on orders  which are expected to increase in volume declined by million for telemetry products and microwave components due to the continued weakness in the commercial communications markets 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million for naval power equipment due to higher shipments arising from the resolution of the production and quality control issues at the spd electrical systems business and million primarily for ftsats and guidance products due to strong demand from the dod 
the increase in sales from acquired businesses was million 
the acquired businesses include detection systems  ruggedized command control  electron devices  wolf coach  imc  westwood and wescam  all of which were acquired in  and klein  which was acquired in sales of eds declined by million to million for compared with million for  primarily because the initial installation of eds at major us airports by the tsa was completed by the end of  which reduced the tsa s procurement requirements for new systems 
operating income increased by million to million for from million for operating margin decreased by percentage points to for from for lower sales for eds reduced operating margin by percentage points 
volume declines for telemetry  fuzing and undersea warfare products lowered operating margin by percentage points 
lower margins from acquired businesses reduced operating margin by percentage points 
the resolution of production quality problems for naval power equipment caused increased shipments and reduced rework costs  which increased operating margin by percentage points 
the settlement of a claim increased operating margin by percentage points

excluding these acquisitions  sales grew million  or  in volume increased by million for eds  million for secure communication systems  million for training services and devices  million for navigation and guidance products and million for military displays products 
these sales increases were partially offset by declines of million on naval power equipment and million on static transfer switches used for commercial applications 
sales of ballistic missile targets and services declined million 
the remaining decline in sales of million was primarily related to acoustic undersea warfare products because of lower volume on spares 
sales from commercial  primarily products increased million to million for from million for the detection systems  imc and wolf coach acquired businesses contributed million of the increase in sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales declined million or 
this decrease in sales was due to volume declines of million on commercial aviation products  million on microwave components and million on primewave communication products 
these declines were partially offset by increases of million for maritime voyage recorders and million primarily for technical and product support services for commercial customers 
commercial  primarily products sales declined to of total sales for from for the decline was primarily attributable to the acquisitions we completed during  including the is acquisition  and to a lesser extent  the decline in our commercial sales 
this decline was attributable to the continued weakness in the commercial aviation and communications markets 
consolidated costs and expenses increased by  million to  million for from  million for  primarily as a result of the increase in sales 
in accordance with sfas no 
 on january  we stopped amortizing our goodwill to expenses 
goodwill amortization expense was million for sfas no 
also requires that we evaluate the fair value of our goodwill annually to determine if it has been impaired 
we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill as of january  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
and wrote off million of goodwill related to certain of our space and broadband commercial communications businesses  which has been reported as a million loss after income taxes for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  as discussed below 
if we experience any impairments to the carrying value of our goodwill after january   we will have to report them as a loss from operations 
during  we did not have any other goodwill impairments 
costs and expenses for contracts  primarily us government increased by  million to  million for from  million for approximately of the increase is attributable to our acquired businesses 
the remaining increase is primarily attributed to internal growth for eds and secure communication systems 
goodwill amortization expense was million for sg a costs allocated to our us government contracts were million for and million for see note to our consolidated financial statements 
costs and expenses for commercial  primarily products increased by million to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to increased sales as a result of the detection systems acquired business  which was partially offset by lower expenses for microwave components products due to lower sales volume 
goodwill amortization expense was million for sg a expenses  including r d expenses  increased by million to million for from million for  primarily because of sg a expenses incurred by our acquired businesses 
consolidated operating income increased by million to million for from million for the increase was due to higher sales for all of our segments 
the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased consolidated operating income by million 
consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales operating margin declined by percentage points to for from for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased consolidated operating margin by percentage points 
operating margins compared to operating margins for  excluding goodwill amortization expense  declined for our training  simulation support services  aviation products aircraft modernization and specialized products segments  and increased for our secure communications isr segment 
the changes in the operating margins for our segments are discussed below 
operating income for contracts  primarily u 
s government increased by million to million for from million for operating margin increased by percentage points to for  from for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased operating margin by percentage points 
operating income for includes a loss of million for the settlement in june of certain litigations that we assumed in connection with a business we acquired in  which reduced operating margin for by percentage points 
the remaining decline in operating margin was due to the absence in of a favorable performance adjustment recorded in on the avcatt contract 
operating income included approximately million of losses in both and related to our naval power equipment business that were caused by production problems which reduced sales volume and related costs to fix manufacturing and quality control problems 
operating income for commercial  primarily products declined by million to million for from million for operating margin declined by percentage points to for from for the decline was principally attributable to lower gross margin contributions from commercial aviation products  microwave components  and space and broadband communication products because of volume declines  as well as continued marketing  selling and development expenses for the primewave business 
the impact of not amortizing goodwill partially offset these decreases in operating margin by percentage points 
interest expense increased by million to million for from million for the increase is attributable to higher outstanding debt for primarily related to the financing of the is acquisition  which was partially offset by lower interest rates on our debt 
our interest rate swap agreements  which converted the fixed interest rates on million of our senior subordinated notes to variable interest rates  reduced our interest expense for by million because of declining interest rates 
in june of  we also redeemed our million senior subordinated notes and replaced them with senior subordinated notes that have a fixed interest rate which reduced our interest expense by million 
see liquidity and capital resources financing activities below 
interest and other income increased by million to million for from million for  principally due to interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  included a net gain of million  comprising a gain on the sale of a interest in the acss business  largely offset by the write down of the carrying value of an investment in the common stock of a telecommunications company because the decline in value for that common stock was determined to be other than temporary 
the income tax provision for is based on an effective income tax rate of  compared with an effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
amortization expense for goodwill that is not deductible for income tax purposes caused an increase in our effective income tax rate prior to the adoption of sfas no 
basic eps before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to for from for diluted eps before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to for from for the impact of not amortizing goodwill in increased basic eps before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle by and diluted eps before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle by 
excluding the increase in earnings attributable to not amortizing goodwill  basic eps before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle grew and diluted eps before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle grew 
basic eps was and diluted eps was after an after tax charge of million per basic and diluted share for the early retirement of million of our senior subordinated notes and a loss of million per basic share and per diluted share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for a goodwill impairment  recorded effective as of january  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased by to million for from million for the increase principally reflects the additional shares outstanding from the sale of million shares of our common stock effective may   and the sale of million shares of our common stock effective june  the diluted eps computation for did not include the dilutive effect of the million shares of l holdings common stock that are issuable upon conversion of the codes see notes and to the consolidated financial statements because the conditions for their conversion were not satisfied 
however  if the codes had been convertible  reported diluted eps would have decreased by approximately for secure communications isr sales for the secure communications isr segment increased by million to  million for from million for the is and comcept acquired businesses  contributed million of sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales grew million  or 
volumes on secure communication systems  secure data links and military communications products increased million because of greater demand for secure communications from the dod and us government intelligence agencies 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of million primarily due to lower volumes of primewave communication products 
operating income increased by million to million for from million for because of higher sales and operating margin 
operating margin improved by percentage points to for compared to for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased operating margin by percentage points 
increased volume and cost improvements on secure communication systems increased margins by percentage points 
higher losses for the primewave business in due to lower sales  higher marketing  selling and development expenses and a provision to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by million lowered operating margin by percentage points 
the remaining change in operating margins was principally attributable to margins from the is acquired business  which was higher than the segment operating margin for training  simulation support services sales for the training  simulation support services segment increased by million to million for from million for the l analytics  eer  ship analytics  sy technologies  telos and tma acquired businesses contributed million of the increase in sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales declined million  or 
sales for ballistic missile targets and services at our coleman research business declined by million primarily because of a contract completed in and the delay in the award of its follow on contract  which is related to the us missile defense agency s decision to consolidate the target requirements for all of its major missile defense programs into a single contract for fiscal year the decline in ballistic missile targets and services was largely offset by volume increases for training services from new contracts with the dod  contracts competitively awarded during and software and systems engineering services 
operating income increased by million to million for from million for because of higher sales and operating margin 
operating margin increased by percentage points to for compared to for principally because of the impact of not amortizing goodwill 
aviation products aircraft modernization sales for the aviation products aircraft modernization segment increased million to million for from million for the is and spar acquired businesses contributed million to sales 
excluding acquisitions  sales declined million  or  because of lower volumes for commercial aviation recorders and tcas products that were partially offset by sales increases for military displays products and commercial maritime voyage recorders 
the decline in commercial aviation products sales was caused by a decline in orders and customer directed deferrals of deliveries stemming from the continued downturn in the commercial aircraft industry that began in and which remained weak during operating income increased by million to million for from million for  because of higher sales from acquired businesses 
operating margin declined by percentage points to for from for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased operating margin by percentage points 
lower volumes on tcas and aviation recorders  increased development expenses for a terrain awareness warning system and a commercial displays product line reduced operating margin by percentage points 
the remaining decrease in operating margin of percentage points was principally attributable to margins from the is and spar acquired businesses  which averaged and were lower than the segment operating margin for margins for our aircraft modification businesses are lower than the margins for our commercial aviation products businesses  and the aircraft modification businesses generated of the segment s sales for compared with only for  which reduced the overall margin for the entire segment as we expected 
specialized products sales for the specialized products segment increased by million to  million for from  million for the bt fuze  detection systems  electron devices  imc  kdi  ruggedized command control  wescam  westwood and wolf coach acquired businesses contributed million of sales 
excluding these acquisitions  sales increased by million  or 
sales of eds used in airport security  principally relating to a contract from the transportation security administration  contributed million of the increase in sales 
navigation and guidance products sales also increased by million 
these increases to sales were partially offset by volume declines of million on naval power equipment arising from lower shipments caused by production capacity diverted to fixing quality control problems  million on training devices because certain contracts were completed in  million for acoustic undersea warfare products primarily arising from lower spares volume  and million for commercial static transfer switches because of the deterioration of the internet service provider market 
the remaining decline of million was principally on microwave components and telemetry and space products arising from continued softness and declining demand in the space  broadband and wireless commercial communications markets 
operating income increased by million to million for from million for because of higher sales and operating margin 
operating margin improved by percentage points to for compared to for the impact of not amortizing goodwill increased operating margin by percentage points 
higher volumes for eds caused an increase in operating margin of percentage points 
these increases were partially offset by declines in operating margin that was primarily related to lower volumes on naval power equipment  microwave components and training devices  and the absence in of a favorable performance adjustment recorded in on the avcatt contract 
liquidity and capital resources balance sheet contracts in process increased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  the increase included million related to acquired businesses and million principally from

l s days receivable outstanding dro was at december   compared with at december  we calculate our dro by dividing i our aggregate end of period billed receivables and net unbilled contract receivables  by ii our sales for the last twelve month period adjusted on a pro forma basis to include the acquisitions that we completed as of the end of the period which amounted to  million  divided by l s billed receivables  net of uncollectible account allowances  increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in billed receivables was from l s us government contractor businesses and related to organic sales growth  as well as the vertex and mas business acquisitions 
the uncollectible accounts allowance increased by million to million at december   compared to million at december   and was for receivables from l s commercial businesses 
our us government and foreign government customers  which generated of l s sales for  present very low uncollectible account risks due to their high credit quality  and therefore  generally require no uncollectible account allowances 
l s days inventory held dih was at december   compared with at december  we calculate dih by dividing i our aggregate end of period net inventoried contract costs and inventories at lower of cost or market  by ii our cost of sales for the last twelve month period adjusted on a pro forma basis to include the acquisitions that we completed as of the end of the period  divided by included in contracts in process at december  are net billed receivables of million and net inventories of million related to our primewave communications business 
at december   we had million of net billed receivables and million of net inventories related to our primewave communications business 
the increase in property  plant and equipment pp e during was principally related to capital expenditures and the avionics systems  vertex and mas acquired businesses 
the percentage of depreciation expense to average gross pp e declined to for from for the decline was attributable to fully depreciated pp e  which is continuing to be used in certain of our operations despite having net carrying amounts of zero after accumulated depreciation and which will not be removed from the balance sheet until they are retired or otherwise disposed 
we did not change any of the depreciation methods or estimated useful lives for assets that l uses to calculate its depreciation expense 
goodwill increased by million to  million at december   from  million at december  the increase was comprised of i million for acquisitions completed during  ii million for increases to purchase prices for certain acquisitions completed prior to january   related to final closing date net assets of the acquired businesses and contingent purchase price adjustments or earnouts  which were resolved during the period  and iii million primarily related to final estimates of fair value for acquired assets and liabilities assumed on acquisitions completed prior to january  the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the avionics systems  vertex and mas acquired businesses  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments 
the increase in accrued expenses was due to the vertex and mas acquired businesses and to the timing of payments 
the increase in accrued employment costs was due to the timing of payments of salaries and wages to employees  including those employees of newly acquired businesses 
the increase in other current liabilities was primarily due to acquired businesses and an increase in collections for milestone billings in excess of costs incurred on contracts for training devices and services related to the completion of certain performance milestones  which were partially offset by cost incurred for accrued product warranties and for certain contracts in process in a loss position and a reduction for contracts in process with credit balances 
the increase in pension and postretirement liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payments 
the increase in other liabilities was primarily due to amounts from our acquired businesses and the deferred net gains recorded in connection with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements during and   as discussed below 
customer advances decreased by million because liquidations exceeded collections  primarily related to shipments and performance on contracts with foreign customers for acoustic undersea warfare products and aircraft modernization 
the timing of collections and liquidation of customer advances are prescribed by contract terms  and generally do not coincide because collections mostly occur upon the award of a contract and during the earlier periods of performance 
conversely  liquidations mostly occur during later periods of performance as products are delivered and other work items are completed 
additionally  customer advances do not affect or determine the timing of revenue recognition for a contract because customer advances are a contract financing method 
pension plans l maintains defined benefit pension plans covering employees at certain of its businesses 
at december   our balance sheet included a pension benefits liability of million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase is due to pension expense recognized exceeding our pension funding and an increase in the minimum liability of million 
at the end of  l s projected benefit obligation  which includes accumulated benefits plus the incremental benefits attributable to projected future salary increases for covered employees  was million and exceeded the fair value of l s pension plan assets of million by million 
at the end of  l s projected benefit obligation was million and exceeded the fair value of l s pension plan assets of million by million 
the increase in the unfunded status of our pension plans of million from million at the end of to million at the end of  was principally due to the million actuarial loss that we experienced in the substantial majority of our actuarial loss was due to the reduction in the discount rate of basis points that we made at the end of to from at the end of  which increased the present value of l s projected benefit obligations at the end of by million 
the difference between the unfunded status amount of million at the end of and the pension liability recorded on our balance sheet of million is attributable to net unrecognized actuarial losses partially offset by the minimum pension liability of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  the actuarial gains and losses that our pension plans experienced in were not recognized in pension expense for instead  they were deferred and will be amortized to pension expense in future periods over the estimated average remaining service periods of the covered employees

l uses a november measurement date to determine its end of year december pension benefit obligations and fair value of pension plan assets  and a fiscal year ending november to determine its annual pension expense  including actual returns on plan assets 
l s actual return on plan assets for  based on the fiscal year ended november   was million or on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  l s actual return on plan assets for the twelve months ended december  was approximately million  or 
our pension expense for was million 
we expect pension expense for to be between million and million 
as discussed above  at the end of  we reduced our discount rate from to  which will increase the interest cost component of pension expense for the higher interest cost in our estimated pension expense is expected to be substantially offset by the increase of million in our pension plan assets during  which will increase our expected return on plan assets by approximately million  and decrease our estimated pension expense by the same amount 
our actual pension expense for will be based upon a number of factors  including the effect of any additional acquired businesses for which we assume liabilities for pension benefits  actual pension plan contributions and changes if any to our pension assumptions for  including the discount rate  expected long term return on plan assets and salary increases 
our contributions for the full year were million 
during and  the us congress granted plan sponsors an interest rate reduction for calculating minimum pension plan contributions 
for  we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans assuming the extension of such interest rate reduction  or million if the interest rate reduction is not extended 
a substantial portion of our pension plan contributions for l s businesses that are us government contractors are recoverable as allowable indirect contract costs at amounts generally equal to the annual pension contributions 
our projected benefit obligation and annual pension expense are significantly affected by the discount rate assumption we use 
for example  an additional reduction to the discount rate of basis points would have increased our projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million  and our estimated pension expense for by approximately million 
conversely  an increase to the discount rate of basis points would have decreased our projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million  and our estimated pension expense for by approximately million 
our shareholders equity at december  reflects a non cash charge of million net of tax to record the increase in the minimum pension liability for the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
this non cash charge had no effect on our compliance with the financial covenants of our debt agreements and did not impact our results of operations for statement of cash flows our cash position was million at december  and december  and million at december  the table below provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated

operating activities we generated million of cash from operating activities during  an increase of million from million generated during net income adjusted for non cash expenses and deferred income taxes increased by million to million for from million for deferred income taxes increased primarily because of larger estimated tax deductions arising from our recent acquisitions 
non cash expenses consist primarily of contributions of l holdings common stock to employee savings plans and depreciation and amortization 
during  the use of cash from the change in operating assets and liabilities decreased to million  compared to million for the use of cash for contracts in process was driven by increases in unbilled receivables primarily for our defense businesses  partially offset by collections primarily for our eds business 
the use of cash for other assets was primarily due to capitalized software development costs for new products 
the use of cash for accounts payable was due to the timing of payments 
the timing of payments to employees for salaries and wages was a source of cash because costs and expenses for salaries and wages exceeded cash payments for them 
the source of cash from the change in pension and postretirement benefits was due to expenses exceeding related cash contributions 
pension plan contributions in amounted to million  and exceeded our originally planned contributions for by more than million 
the use of cash for other current liabilities was to fund certain contracts in a loss position for which estimated costs exceeded the estimated contract value  partially offset by cash collections for milestone billings in excess of cost incurred on contracts primarily for training devices 
the source of cash from other liabilities was generated primarily from terminating interest rate swap agreements 
during  we terminated interest rate swap agreements  which is discussed in derivative financial instruments  and generated cash proceeds related to deferred gains on them of million  of which million was recorded in other current liabilities and million was recorded in other liabilities 
for  we also terminated interest rate swap agreements and generated cash proceeds related to net deferred gains on them of million 
during  we generated million of cash from operating activities  an increase of million from million generated during net income adjusted for non cash expenses and deferred income taxes increased by million to million in from million in during  the use of cash from the change in operating assets and liabilities decreased to million  compared to million in our cash flows from operating activities during reflect increases in billed and unbilled receivables  other current assets and other assets 
the use of cash related to customer advances was due to liquidations on certain foreign contracts 
the use of cash for other current liabilities was to fund contracts in a loss position for which estimated costs exceed the estimated contract value  and was partially offset by an increase in accrued warranty costs primarily for explosive detection systems delivered in the timing of payments to employees for salaries and wages  as well as the timing of interest payments  was a source of cash 
the source of cash in other liabilities was primarily due to deferred gains on the termination of our swap agreements 
pension plan contributions in amounted to million 
in  we used cash for increases in inventories  receivables and negative operating margins related to our primewave business and naval power equipment products  as well as for incurred contract costs in excess of billings for the continued effort on the avcatt contract 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a settlement of certain items related to a services agreement and lower income tax payments 
our cash from operating activities includes interest payments on debt of million for  million for and million for our interest expense also includes amortization of deferred debt issue costs and deferred gains on terminated interest swap agreements  which are non cash items 
our cash from operating activities includes income tax payments  net of refunds  of million for  million for  and million for our income tax payments were substantially less than our provisions for income taxes reported on our statements of operations primarily because of income tax deductions from our acquired businesses structured as asset purchases and income tax deductions for compensation expense arising from the exercise of employee stock options 
the income tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options are accounted for as a reduction to current income taxes payable and an increase to shareholders equity see note to our consolidated financial statements 
l receives substantial income tax deductions from its acquisitions of businesses that are structured as asset purchases for income tax purposes 
the effect of these income tax deductions is that our cash payments for income taxes are less than our provision for income taxes reported on the statement of operations 
this difference is presented in the deferred income tax provision on our statement of cash flows 
the deferred income tax provision primarily results from deducting amortization of tax intangibles  including goodwill  from the acquisitions structured as asset purchases on l s income tax returns over years  in accordance with income tax rules and regulations  while no goodwill amortization is recorded for financial reporting purposes  in accordance with sfas no 
we expect that the acquisitions l has completed through december  will continue to generate substantial annual deferred tax benefits through while these income tax deductions are reported as changes to deferred income tax liabilities and assets  they are not differences that are scheduled to reverse in future periods from normal operations 
rather  they will only reverse if l sells its acquired businesses or incurs a goodwill impairment loss for them  because in either case  l s financial reporting amounts for goodwill would be greater than the income tax basis for goodwill 
l also receives significant income tax deductions and deferred tax benefits from its acquired businesses structured as asset purchases for income tax purposes from accelerated depreciation of plant and equipment 
investing activities during  we used  million of cash for acquisitions of businesses 
we paid million to acquire avionics systems  aeromet  mas  vertex and certain assets of ipicom  inc we also paid million for certain acquisitions that we completed prior to january   for purchase price adjustments based on final closing date net assets of the acquired businesses and earnouts  which were resolved during the period 
during  we invested  million to acquire businesses  primarily for integrated systems and detection systems 
during  we invested million to acquire businesses 
on may   we sold a interest in acss to thales avionics for million in cash  which resulted in an after tax gain of million 
financing activities debt senior credit facilities 
at december   the senior credit facilities were comprised of a million five year revolving credit facility maturing on may  and a million day revolving facility 
on february   the maturity date of the day revolving credit facility was extended to february  at december   available borrowings under our senior credit facilities were million  after reductions for outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities at december  redemptions 
on december   l holdings announced a full redemption of million of its convertible senior subordinated notes due convertible notes  which expired on january  at december   holders of approximately million of the convertible notes had exercised their conversion rights and converted such notes into  shares of l holdings common stock 
on january   holders of million of the convertible notes exercised their conversion rights and converted such notes into  shares of l holdings common stock 
the remaining million of convertible notes were redeemed on january  for cash 
as a result of these conversions and redemptions  our principal amount of long term debt decreased by million and shareholders equity increased by million in january compared to december  on may   l communications initiated a full redemption of all the outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due may notes 
on june   we purchased and paid cash for all the outstanding may notes  including accrued interest

represents open purchase orders at december  for amounts expected to be paid for goods or services that are legally binding on us 
other long term liabilities primarily consists of workers compensation  deferred compensation and litigation settlement accruals for the years ending december  and thereafter and also includes pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions that we expect to pay in our pension and postretirement benefit plan funding policy is generally to contribute in accordance with cost accounting standards that affect government contractors  subject to the internal revenue code and regulations thereon 
during and  us congress had granted plan sponsors an interest rate reduction for calculating minimum pension plan contributions 
for  we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans  assuming the extension of such interest rate reduction  or million if the interest rate reduction is not extended and million to our postretirement benefit plans 
due to the current uncertainty of the amounts used to compute our expected pension and postretirement benefit plan funding  we believe it is not practicable to reasonably estimate such future funding for periods in excess of year 
off balance sheet arrangements on december   we entered into two real estate lease agreements  as lessee  with a third party lessor  which expire on december  and are accounted for as operating leases 
on or before the lease expiration date  we can exercise options under the lease agreements to either renew the leases  purchase both properties for million  or sell both properties on behalf of the lessor the sale option 
if we elect the sale option  we must pay the lessor a residual guarantee amount of million for both properties  on or before the lease expiration date  and at the time both properties are sold  we must pay the lessor a supplemental rent equal to the gross sales proceeds in excess of the residual guarantee amount not to exceed million 
we have a contract to provide and operate for the us air force usaf a full service training facility  including simulator systems near a usaf base 
we acted as the construction agent on behalf of the third party owner lessors for procurement and construction for the simulator systems  which were completed and delivered in august on december   we  as lessee  entered into an operating lease agreement for a term of years for one of the simulator systems with the owner lessor 
at the end of the lease term  we may elect to purchase the simulator system at fair market value  which can be no less than million and no greater than million 
if we do not elect to purchase the simulator system  then on the date of expiration  we shall pay to the lessor  as additional rent  million and return the simulator system to the lessor 
the aggregate non cancelable rental payments under this operating lease are million  including the additional rent of million 
on february   we  as lessee  entered into an operating lease agreement for a term of years for the remaining simulation systems with the owner lessor 
at the end of the lease term  we may elect to purchase the simulator systems at fair market value  which can be no less than million and no greater than million 
if we do not elect to purchase the simulator systems  then on the date of expiration  we shall return the simulator systems to the lessor 
the aggregate non cancelable rental payments under this operating lease are million 
derivative financial instruments included in our derivative financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts  interest rate swap agreements and the embedded derivatives related to the issuance of our codes 
all of our derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
embedded derivatives 
the contingent interest payment and contingent conversion features of the codes are embedded derivatives which we bifurcated from the codes and separately recorded on our balance sheet 
on the date of issuance of the codes  we ascribed million of the net proceeds from the codes to those embedded derivatives which represented their aggregate fair value  and recorded it as a liability in accordance with sfas no 
the subsequent increases decreases to the fair values of the embedded derivatives are recorded as losses gains in the statement of operations 
their fair values at december  were million  which represents a liability 
interest rate risk 
our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates include borrowings under the senior credit facilities all of which are denominated in us dollars 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities 
the interest rates on the senior subordinated notes and codes are fixed rate and are not affected by changes in interest rates 
depending on the interest rate environment we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to convert the fixed interest rates on a portion of our outstanding debt to variable interest rates  or terminate any existing interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we do not have any interest rate swap agreements in place 
we may enter into interest rate swap agreements during  depending on market interest rates and conditions

additionally  some of our us and foreign operations have contracts with customers which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of those operations 
to mitigate the risk associated with certain of these contracts denominated in foreign currency we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and the fair value of these contracts was million  which represented an asset 
we account for these contracts as cash flow hedges 
equity price risk 
our equity investments in common stocks and limited partnerships are subject to equity price risk  including equity risk 
the fair values of our investments are based on quoted market prices for investments which are readily marketable securities  and estimated fair value for nonreadily marketable securities  which is generally equal to historical cost unless such investment has experienced an other than temporary impairment 
both the carrying values and estimated fair values of such instruments amounted to million at the end of backlog and orders we define funded backlog as the value of funded orders received from customers  less the amount of sales recognized on those funded orders 
we define funded orders as the value of contract awards received from the us government  for which the us government has appropriated funds  plus the value of contract awards and orders received from customers other than the us government 
our funded backlog at december  was  million and at december  was  million 
we expect to record as sales approximately of our funded backlog as of december  during however  there can be no assurance that our funded backlog will become sales in any particular period  if at all 
funded orders received for the year ended december  were  million   million for the year ended december  and  million for the year ended december  our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contract awards including those pertaining to multi year  cost plus reimbursable contracts  which are generally funded on an annual basis 
funded backlog also excludes the sales value of unexercised contract options that may be exercised by customers under existing contracts and the sales value of purchase orders that we may receive under indefinite quantity contracts or basic ordering agreements

contingencies we are engaged in providing products and services under contracts with the us government and  to a lesser degree  under foreign government contracts  some of which are funded by the us government 
all such contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements  and  periodically  agencies of the us government investigate whether such contracts were and are being conducted in accordance with these requirements 
under government procurement regulations  an indictment by a federal grand jury could result in the suspension for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts 
a conviction could result in debarment from contracting with the federal government for a specified term 
additionally  in the event that us government expenditures for products and services of the type we manufacture and provide are reduced and not offset by greater commercial sales or other new programs or products or acquisitions  there may be a reduction in the volume of contracts or subcontracts awarded to us 
we continually assess our obligations with respect to applicable environmental protection laws 
while it is difficult to determine the timing and ultimate cost to be incurred in order to comply with these laws  based upon available internal and external assessments  with respect to those environmental loss contingencies of which we are aware  we believe that even without considering potential insurance recoveries  if any  there are no environmental loss contingencies that  individually or in the aggregate  would be material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
also  we have been periodically subject to litigation  claims or assessments and various contingent liabilities incidental to our business 
we accrue for these contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in connection with the is acquisition we assumed responsibility for implementing certain corrective actions required under federal law to remediate the greenville  texas site location  and to pay a portion of those remediation costs 
the hazardous substances requiring remediation have been substantially characterized  and the remediation system has been partially implemented 
we have estimated that our share of the remediation cost will not exceed million  and will be incurred over a period of years 
we have established adequate reserves for these costs 
on august   aviation communications surveillance systems  llc acss  a subsidiary of l communications corporation  was sued by honeywell international inc and honeywell intellectual properties  inc 
collectively  honeywell for alleged infringement of patents that relate to terrain awareness avionics 
the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
in december of  honeywell withdrew without prejudice the lawsuit against acss and agreed to proceed with non binding arbitration 
we had previously investigated the honeywell patents and believe that acss has valid defenses against honeywell s patent infringement suit 
in addition  acss has been indemnified to a certain extent by thales avionics  which provided acss with the alleged infringing technology 
thales avionics owns of acss 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate disposition of honeywell s pending claim will not result in a material liability to us 
l integrated systems and its predecessors have been involved in a litigation with kalitta air kalitta air arising from a contract to convert boeing aircraft from passenger configuration to cargo freighters 
the lawsuit was brought in the northern district of california on january  the aircraft were modified using supplemental type certificates stcs issued in by the federal aviation administration faa to hayes international  inc hayes pemco as a subcontractor to gatx airlog company gatx 
between and  hayes pemco modified five aircraft as a subcontractor to gatx using the stcs 
between and  chrysler technologies airborne systems  inc ctas  a predecessor to l integrated systems  performed as a subcontractor to gatx and modified an additional five aircraft using the stcs 
two of the aircraft modified by ctas were owned by american international airways  the predecessor to kalitta air 
in  the faa determined that the engineering data provided by hayes pemco supporting the stcs was inadequate and issued an airworthiness directive that effectively grounded the ten modified aircraft 
the kalitta air aircraft have not been in revenue service since that date 
the matter was tried in january against gatx and ctas with the jury finding fault on the part of gatx but rendering a unanimous defense verdict in favor of ctas 
certain co defendants had settled prior to trial 
the ninth circuit court of appeals has reversed and remanded the trial court s summary judgment rulings in favor of ctas regarding a negligence claim by kalitta air  which asserts that ctas as an expert in aircraft modification should have known that the stcs were deficient  and excluding certain evidence at trial 
based on this ruling  it appears likely that the matter will have to be retried 
in august of  kalitta air has recalculated its damages based on consequential damage theories of lost revenues and income and diminution in value of the business and is asserting damages in excess of million 
ctas insurance carrier has accepted defense of the matter with a reservation of rights 
the company continues to believe that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend this matter 
the company and l communications security and detection systems l sds have been named  along with many other defendants  including other security screening systems manufacturers  as defendants in a number of lawsuits brought in the southern district of new york by or on behalf of the victims of the terrorist attacks on september  counsel for the plaintiffs have represented to the court that they intend to amend some or all of their complaints to delete certain of the defendants  including the company and l sds  and to date  approximately of the complaints have been amended to drop the company and l sds as a defendant 
in addition  the court has ruled that the plaintiffs who complete their applications for relief under a federal fund may not pursue judicial action 
the court has ordered that the plaintiffs file final amended complaints by march   at which time the company and l sds will know how many  if any  actions will be pending against them 
the complaints allege various causes of action  including claims of wrongful death  negligence  strict liability and breach of contract  and seek compensatory and punitive damages 
the company and l sds believe that they have meritorious defenses to these actions and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuits 
the company purchased l sds from perkinelmer  inc perkinelmer on june  the actions have been tendered to the company s and perkinelmer s insurance carriers  who have accepted the defense of these matters 
on november   we initiated a proceeding against osi systems  inc osi in the united states district court sitting in the southern district of new york seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment that we had fulfilled all of our obligations under a letter of intent with osi the osi letter of intent 
under the osi letter of intent  we were to negotiate definitive agreements with osi for the sale of certain businesses we acquired from perkinelmer  inc on june  on february   osi filed an answer and counterclaims in the new york action alleging  among other things  that we breached our obligations under the osi letter of intent and seeking damages in excess of million  not including punitive damages 
under the osi letter of intent  we proposed selling to osi the conventional detection business and the argus business that we recently acquired from perkinelmer  inc negotiations with osi lasted for almost one year and ultimately broke down over issues regarding  among other things  intellectual property  product line definitions  allocation of employees and due diligence 
we believe that the claims asserted by osi in its suit are without merit and intend to defend against the osi claims vigorously 
l communications vertex aerospace llc formerly known as vertex aerospace llc and acquired by the company on december  l vertex is named as a defendant in nine wrongful death lawsuits in the district court  th judicial district  tarrant county  texas  in the circuit court of the th judicial circuit  broward county  florida  and in the united states district court  western district of north carolina arising from the crash of air midwest flight at charlotte douglas international airport in charlotte  north carolina on january  the crash resulted in the deaths of nineteen passengers and two crewmembers 
each of the lawsuits alleges contributing factors including that the accident was caused by the improper maintenance of the aircraft by l vertex  and seeks to recover compensatory and punitive damages 
no discovery has taken place in the lawsuits at this time 
eight claims resulting from this incident have previously settled 
the national transportation safety board ntsb investigated the cause of the crash and has concluded that the crash was caused by the incorrect rigging of the elevator control system compounded by the airplane s center of gravity  which was substantially aft of the certified limit  with several other contributing factors 
l vertex believes that it has meritorious defenses to the pending lawsuits  and intends to defend the cases vigorously 
the actions have been tendered to l vertex s insurance carrier  who has accepted the defense of each action served upon l vertex to date 
l vertex was also indemnified by air midwest for losses l vertex incurred arising out of its provision of maintenance services to air midwest 
based on the availability of insurance and the indemnification from air midwest  we do not believe we will have a material liability in this matter 
with respect to those investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments of which we are aware  we are of the opinion that the probability is remote that  after taking into account certain provisions that have been made with respect to these matters  the ultimate resolution of any such investigative actions  items of litigation  claims or assessments will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
recently issued accounting standards in december of  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised its fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin r requires that a business enterprise review all of its legal structures used to conduct its business activities  including those to hold assets  and its majority owned subsidiaries  to determine whether those legal structures are variable interest entities vies required to be consolidated for financial reporting purposes by the business enterprise 
a vie is a legal structure for which the holders of a majority voting interest may not have a controlling financial interest in the legal structure 
fin r provides guidance for identifying those legal structures and provides guidance for determining whether a business enterprise shall consolidate a vie 
fin r requires that a business enterprise that holds a significant variable interest in a vie make new disclosures in their financial statements 
we are required to adopt the provisions of fin r for our interim period ending march  we do not believe that l holds any significant interests in vies that would require consolidation or additional disclosures 
in march of  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and how consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate accounting units 
eitf no 
applies to all deliverables within contractually binding arrangements in all industries  except to the extent that a deliverable in a contractual arrangement is subject to other existing higher level authoritative literature 
eitf became effective for revenue arrangements entered into after july  the adoption of eitf no

sfas no 
requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
sfas no

sfas no

on december   president bush signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of dima 
this act introduces a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
in january of  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
in accordance with fsp  we are electing to defer recognition of any potential savings on the measure of the accumulated postretirement benefit or net periodic benefit cost as a result of dima until specific authoritative guidance on the accounting of the federal subsidy is issued 
therefore  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act on our postretirement medical plans 
inflation the effect of inflation on our sales and earnings has not been significant 
although a majority of our sales are made under long term contracts  the selling prices of such contracts  established for deliveries in the future  generally reflect estimated costs to be incurred in these future periods 
in addition  some of our contracts provide for price adjustments through cost escalation clauses 
forward looking statements certain of the matters discussed concerning our operations  cash flows  financial position  economic performance  and financial condition  including in particular  the likelihood of our success in developing and expanding our business and the realization of sales from backlog  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to events or conditions or that include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  intends and similar expressions are forward looking statements 
although we believe that these statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  including projections of orders  sales  operating margins  earnings  cash flow  research and development costs  working capital  capital expenditures and other projections  they are subject to several risks and uncertainties  and therefore  we can give no assurance that these statements will be achieved 
such statements will also be influenced by factors such as
