net interest income 
the primary component of earnings for the company is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and company borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
for this purpose  volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as levels of noninterest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively

net interest margin  which represents net interest income on a fully taxable basis divided by average interest earning assets  was compared to and  respectively  for the same periods 
the decreases in net interest spread and net interest margin in over were primarily due to the average yields on interest earning assets decreasing more than average yields on interest bearing liabilities

the net change in cash  as reported in the statement of cash flows  decreased by million for the year ended december  some of the more significant inflows were from the net increase in deposits and the proceeds from the maturity of investments 
those cash inflows were partially offset by the cash outflows for loan originations  purchases of investment securities and purchases of premises and equipment 
over the course of the year  loan principal payments contributed million to the cash inflows 
net deposits increased million and million in investment securities matured during cash inflows were used mainly to fund loan originations  which amounted to million for the year 
in addition  million was used to purchase premises and equipment and million to purchase investment securities 
sources of funds 
the company s sources of funds are customer deposits  loan repayments  current earnings  cash and demand balances due from other banks  federal funds  short term investments  investment securities available for sale and trust preferred securities 
these funds are used for loan originations and deposit withdrawals  to satisfy other financial commitments and to support continuing operations 
management anticipates that the bank will rely primarily upon customer deposits and investments to provide liquidity in the company will mainly use such funds to make loans and to purchase securities  the majority of which are issued by federal  state and local governments

at december   shareholders equity was of total assets compared to and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in this ratio in primarily resulted from significant asset growth during the year 
the company on a consolidated basis and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements  under which risk percentages are assigned to various categories of assets and off balance sheet items to calculate a risk adjusted capital ratio 
tier i capital generally consists of common shareholders equity and trust preferred obligations  less goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets  while tier ii capital includes the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt  both subject to certain limitations 
the fdic regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as well capitalized  primarily for assignment of fdic insurance premium rates 
to qualify as well capitalized  banks must have a total risk adjusted capital ratio of at least  a tier i risk adjusted capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least 
failure to qualify as well capitalized can a negatively impact a bank s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities  b cause an increase in fdic insurance premium rates  and c impact a bank holding company s ability to utilize certain expedited filing procedures  among other things 
as the following table indicates  the bank qualified as well capitalized at december  december  adequately well capitalized capitalized actual requirement requirement ratio total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required in the near future due to greater than expected growth  unforeseen expenses or revenue shortfalls or otherwise 
in addition  applicable federal and washington state regulations restrict capital distributions by institutions such as the bank  including dividends 
such restrictions are tied to the institution s capital levels after giving effect to distributions

the company s deposits are expected to fluctuate according to the level of the company s deposit market share  economic conditions and normal seasonal variations  among other things 
certificates of deposit are the only deposit group that have stated maturity dates 
at december   the company had million in cds of which approximately million  or  mature on or prior to december  declining interest rate markets and uncertain economic conditions may cause some customers to choose to move funds into core deposit accounts or withdraw funds  rather than renew cds as they mature 
that notwithstanding  management anticipates that a substantial portion of outstanding cds will renew upon maturity 

table of contents borrowings 
the company relies upon advances from the fhlb to supplement funding needs 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions 
as a member  the bank is required to own capital stock in the fhlb and is authorized to apply for advances on the pledge of certain of its mortgage loans and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
under its current credit policies  the fhlb of seattle generally limits advances to of a member s assets  and overnight borrowings may not exceed of the institution s assets 
the fhlb of seattle determines specific lines of credit for each member institution

standby letters of credit  commercial letters of credit and financial guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party or payment by a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued in international trade or to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
except for certain long term guarantees  the majority of guarantees expire in one year 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers

unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than 
table of contents the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
asset liability management the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the company s interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the company s earnings from undue interest rate risk that arises from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
the company maintains an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing the following ratios and trend analyses liquidity  equity  volatile liability dependence  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
the company s policy is to control the exposure of its earnings to changing interest rates by generally endeavoring to maintain a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral position  which is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generate a net interest margin that is least affected by interest rate changes 
when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  the company has generally invested such funds in securities  primarily us treasury securities  securities issued by governmental agencies  municipal securities  fhlb stock and corporate obligations 
the securities portfolio contributes to the company s profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits 
in reviewing the needs of the company with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  the company s management estimates its future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing  and forecasted interest rate changes 
significant accounting policies see part ii  item note d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
anticipated future performance future events are difficult to predict  and the expectations of management are necessarily subject to uncertainty and risk that may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated here 
in making the following statements  management has made a number of assumptions including that the interest rate environment will remain flat through  the local economy will continue on a slow but steady course of improvement  and residential real estate loan volumes will decline from wbco expects to continue its growth strategy and expand its presence in the pacific northwest 
the company s commitment to maintaining asset quality  improving operating efficiency  being attentive to customer satisfaction and maximizing shareholder value remains strong 
wbco has identified long term performance measurement targets 
those targets include a return on equity in excess of  an efficiency ratio in the mid range  earnings per share growth of at least per year  and dividend payouts of at least annually 
management does not expect to attain these targets in the short term  but rather measures its business plan progression against these long term goals 
management anticipates that performance will be affected by a number of factors 
a primary consideration  and one that is subject to uncertainty  is the stability of the economy 
during  the market area in which the company operates began to undergo a slow but steady economic recovery 
in management s 
table of contents opinion  the company is beginning to experience a cautious transition  from that of heavy mortgage loan volumes into a period of increasing commercial lending activity 
in light of this transition and an expected increase in competition for loans  management believes that the company will achieve loan growth in the range of for the year the company is projecting a modest increase in deposits of about for if deposit rate repricing is required to maintain deposits or should rates increase more than expected  the net interest margin could be negatively impacted due to the company s current position of being slightly liability sensitive 
other unexpected changes  such as significant changes in the economy  substantial credit deterioration  or depositors moving sizeable amounts of their funds back into the stock market  could also affect the anticipated performance of the company 
residential real estate loan volumes are expected to decline from the high volumes recently experienced  and generate less fee income 
management expects that its new wholesale lending subsidiary  wfg  will continue to have a negative impact on the company s earnings early this year  but expects wfg to contribute to earnings during if this expectation is not realized  management will seriously consider a restructure of wfg 
in addition to continuing to focus on expense reduction measures  wfg is diversifying and expanding its product lines and offering online services to brokers 
management believes that the company will have ample opportunities to be successful 
the bank has a large portion of market share in island county  which is where the company was founded and has an established identity and reputation within the community 
management believes there are significant opportunities to gain a larger share of the market in the other three counties where the branches are still relatively young and not as well known 
given these opportunities and the preceding assumptions and considerations  management expects to grow earnings over opportunities will be pursued while applying credit discipline and deliberate analysis to ensure quality growth 
readers should not construe these statements as assurances of future performance  and should note that management does not plan to update these projections as the year progresses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that financial performance will decline over time due to changes in prevailing interest rates and resulting yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities 
generally  there are four sources of interest rate risk as described below repricing risk 
generally  repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes affect an institution s assets and liabilities 
basis risk 
basis risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity 
yield curve risk 
yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
option risk 
in banking  option risks are known as borrower options to prepay loans and depositor options to make deposits  withdrawals  and early redemptions 
option risk arises whenever bank products give customers the right  but not the obligation  to alter the quantity of the timing of cash flows 
the company maintains an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk 
the guidelines direct management to assess the impact of changes in interest rates upon both earnings and capital 
the guidelines further provide that in the event of an increase in interest rate risk beyond preestablished limits  management will consider steps to reduce interest rate risk to acceptable levels 

table of contents in april  the company began using hedging practices for third party originated real estate loans through wfg 
hedging is a tool often used in the mortgage industry to minimize the interest rate risk and maximize the yield on secondary market loan production 
the company established hedging guidelines for managing the interest rate risk and hired staff for wfg who had experience with mortgage hedging practices 
additionally  the company uses a third party risk management service for loan tracking and for providing hedging activities 
the company does not speculate on the direction of interest rates and the company s risk management activities are designed to mitigate the effects of interest rate volatility on the economic value of the organization 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulations and interest sensitivity gap analyses 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of other investment securities  loan and deposit volumes and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the income simulation model as of december   the company would expect a decrease in net interest income of  if interest rates increase from current rates by basis points and an increase in net interest income of  if interest rates decrease from current rates by basis points 
the analysis of an institution s interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is another standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk 
the company believes that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the interest rate gaps reported in the table arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
the amounts shown below could be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits and competition 
table of contents months months years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest earning deposits federal funds sold investment securities fhlb stock loans total interest earning assets percent of interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money market deposits savings deposits cds federal funds borrowed trust preferred securities other borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities percent of interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap  as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap  as a percentage of total assets the table illustrates that if assets and liabilities reprice in the time intervals indicated in the table  the company is liability sensitive months and asset sensitive thereafter 
thus  the table indicates that in an environment of increasing interest rates  the net interest income of the company would be adversely affected and in a declining interest rate environment  the company s net interest income would be favorably affected 
as stated above  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
for instance  while the table is based on the assumption that interest bearing demand accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts are immediately sensitive to movements in rates  the company expects that in a changing rate environment  the amount of the adjustment in interest rates for such accounts would be less than the adjustment in categories of assets  which are considered to be immediately sensitive 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
due to these shortcomings  the company places primary emphasis on its income simulation model when managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
bond and debt obligations risk other market driven prices that affect the company s market risk are primarily prices in the markets for governmental bonds and corporate debt 
changes in market risk perceptions and risk tolerance can contribute to changes in prices of such securities affecting the company s capital and liquidity  and indirectly affecting earnings if market changes constrict portfolio management alternatives available to the company or contribute to circumstances affecting the potential impairment of a security 
the company monitors the prices of its investment securities at least once a month 
the company manages this risk primarily by setting portfolio limits  including limits by issuer  by industry  by security type  and for the overall size of its governmental bonds and corporate debt portfolios
