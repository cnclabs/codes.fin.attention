retek s solution retailers face many challenges to be successful in today s retailing environment 
essential to any successful retailing venture is the ability to efficiently extract actionable information from large volumes of data in order to respond quickly to consumer demand 
retek s solutions help provide this information in order to allow retailers to make informed decisions in implementing their business plan 
we have observed several trends as retailers seek to better serve their customers 
two significant trends are the replacement of older technology platforms  and the integration of software applications 
replacement of older technology platforms historically  large and mid sized retailers have relied on custom built software systems to manage business transactions both internally and with trading partners and customers 
these systems have typically been built using s mainframe technology and many of them have been internally developed 
these older systems are generally not internet enabled  and do not permit collaboration among a retailer s partners  suppliers and other members of the supply chain 
within the last several years  retailers have 
table of contents begun to purchase packaged software solutions designed specifically for the retail industry 
however  some of these products have been unable to provide the scalability retailers require to manage the large amounts of data their businesses generate 
some retailers have also adopted enterprise resource planning systems 
these complex systems can be expensive to implement and maintain  typically lack the scalability required by retailers  and do not have specific core retail functionality 
a retailer s basic technology platform must be able to adapt to a rapidly changing and competitive landscape 
many retailers face the additional challenge of operating in a multi channel environment 
as retailers expand their sales outlets to include the internet  catalogs  kiosks and other distribution networks  the complexity of managing inventory and meeting customer demands places tremendous pressure on their business processes and it infrastructure 
to meet consumer expectations  a retailer needs to deliver the retailing experience on the customer s terms  which means having product available when and where the customer wants it 
retailers must have strong forecasting  planning  allocation  replenishment and merchandising capabilities to achieve this goal 
a comprehensive  integrated software infrastructure that spans from supplier to consumer and gives the retailer visibility  flexibility and control to meet demand  is required for successful retailers to compete effectively 
these critical capabilities cannot be delivered using many of the older technology platforms in use today 
application integration having accurate and timely data is integral to successful retailing 
retailers use numerous software applications either purchased from vendors or developed internally  and those applications must interact  sharing data and information 
for example  a retailer may use a point of sale solution from one vendor  a merchandising system developed internally and a data warehouse purchased from another vendor 
these applications may use different protocols  programming languages  databases  architectures and hardware platforms or have other technical differences 
these technical differences cause difficulties when the different applications interact 
interaction among systems can be accomplished in one of two ways data interfacing  or application integration 
data interfacing is the most common approach for having data interact between two different applications 
in order for these applications to interact data must first be packaged in a certain format by one application  ported or connected to the second application  and then unpackaged and converted so that the second application can understand and use that data 
these steps increase the processing time for every transaction and limit the system s ability to scale 
scalability is defined as the ability to maintain service levels and response times as transaction volumes increase 
application integration occurs when applications access the same pool of data without the need to package  unpackage  and convert data to accommodate any technical differences 
thus  in a fully integrated environment  a point of sale application would seamlessly deliver data without conversion or modification to all other applications that require that same data 
retailers have become increasingly interested in software solutions that are integrated rather than interfaced 
often times interfaced solutions result when best of breed solutions are purchased and must then be made to share data 
by selecting different vendors for different functionality  data interchange becomes more difficult 
data interfacing limits a system s ability to calculate real time changes to basic items such as inventory levels 
data interfacing also impacts the ability to customize and upgrade software 
because each application is separate  a change in one application may change how data must be translated to be shared with and by that application 
in turn  this may increase costs and require additional modifications to other interfaced applications that were not customized or upgraded  in order to handle the changes in the original application 
all in all  data interfacing may limit the practicality of customizations and upgrades for a retailer s entire system 
we have developed and deployed software solutions that enable retailers to manage virtually all of their operations 
these operations include point of sale and store operations  order management  
table of contents merchandising  supply chain management and planning  forecasting and optimization operations 
key factors that we believe differentiate our software solutions include application integration by integrating our applications  we reduce the processing required to share data  enable real time access to information  and improve performance 
the use of a business logic layer enables our applications to access data in a consistent way 
value our modular architecture helps retailers meet return on investment roi objectives by allowing them to implement the most critical and valuable applications first 
this modular architecture decreases migration path risk for the replacement of legacy systems and increases the probability of an on time  on budget implementation project

retailers must ensure a wide variety of product assortments are procured from numerous vendors  distributed across complex supply chains and are available at the right place  right time and right price to meet expected consumer demand 
predicting accurate consumer demand can best be done by applying scientific mathematical forecasting models 
these models can help retailers understand historical trends and can project consumer behaviors into the future  thereby providing an accurate picture of future demand

research and development expenses were million  million and million in the fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe that significant investments in research and development will be required in the future to remain competitive 
competition the markets for our software solutions are intensely competitive  constantly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
we encounter competition in our products and services from a number of different sources  including retailer s in house technical staffs  traditional enterprise resource planning 
table of contents vendors and other vendors of retail specific solutions 
of these vendors  our principal competitors include jda software  sap  manhattan associates  manugistics and i technologies 
we compete with a substantial number of other companies focused on providing point solution software applications for specific segments of the retail application market 
in addition  there are new market entrants that may offer competitive products in the future 
we believe that our ability to compete depends on many factors both within and beyond our control  including the ease of use  performance  features  price and reliability of our solutions as compared to those of our competitors  the timing and market acceptance of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions developed by us and our competitors  the quality of our customer service  and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
we believe that our product solution suite is better than those of our competitors in its performance  features and reliability 
in addition  we have in the past introduced new solutions and enhancements to our existing solutions in a more timely manner 
our prices are generally higher than our competitors reflecting  we believe  the added value of our software solutions 
because the market for our software solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  we cannot be assured that we will maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with greater name recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources 
we expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidation 
for example  a number of enterprise software companies have acquired point solution providers to expand their product offerings 
our competitors may also package their products in ways that may discourage users from purchasing our products 
current and potential competitors may establish alliances among themselves or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
in addition  new competitors could emerge and rapidly capture market share 
proprietary rights and licensing our success and ability to compete are in part dependent upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect the source code for our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we license our software under signed license agreements  which impose restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
we rely on technology that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our line of products to perform key functions 
for example  we license the e gate enterprise application integration software from seebeyond corporation  business intelligence software from microstrategy  inc  the acumate component from lucent technologies and wavelink studio from wavelink corporation 
these licenses are non exclusive  worldwide and royalty based 
the royalties we paid seebeyond  microstrategy  lucent and wavelink under these licenses were  in each case  less than of our total revenue in each of the  and fiscal years 
we also license and will continue to license certain products integral to our products and services from other third parties  including accenture  ibm  oracle corp 
and sun microsystems  inc if we are unable to continue any of theses licenses  we will face delays in releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed and integrated into our current products 
these delays  if they occur  could seriously harm our business 

table of contents there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future software solutions infringe on their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of electronic commerce products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business 
environmental matters we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment 
we do not expect that continued compliance with these provisions would have any material effect upon our capital expenditures or earnings

on february   the parties signed and filed a stipulation dismissing the consolidated action without prejudice against us and the individual officers and directors  which the court approved and entered as an order on march  on april   the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in which they elected to proceed with their claims against us and the individual officers and directors only under sections b and a of the exchange act 
the amended complaint alleges that the prospectus filed in connection with the ipo was false or misleading in that it failed to disclose i that the underwriters allegedly were paid excessive commissions by certain of the underwriters customers in return for receiving shares in the ipo and ii that certain of the underwriters customers allegedly agreed to 
table of contents purchase additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket in return for an allocation of shares in the ipo 
the complaint further alleges that the underwriters offered to provide positive market analyst coverage for the company after the ipo  which had the effect of manipulating the market for our stock 
plaintiffs contend that  as a result of the omissions from the prospectus and alleged market manipulation through the use of analysts  the price of our common stock was artificially inflated between november  and december   and that the defendants are liable for unspecified damages to those persons who purchased our common stock during that period 
on july   the company and the individual defendants  along with the rest of the issuers and related officer and director defendants  filed a joint motion to dismiss based on common issues 
opposition and reply papers were filed 
the court rendered its decision on february   which granted dismissal in part of a claim against one of the individual defendants and denied dismissal in all other respects 
on june   a special litigation committee of the board of directors of the company approved a memorandum of understanding the mou reflecting a tentative settlement in which the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the case against the company with prejudice in return for the assignment by the company of claims that the company might have against its underwriters 
the same offer of settlement was made to all issuer defendants involved in the litigation 
no payment to the plaintiffs by the company is required under the mou 
there can be no assurance that the mou will result in a formal settlement or that the court will approve the settlement that the mou sets forth 
the company believes that it and the individual defendants have meritorious defenses to the claims made in the complaint and  if the mou does not result in a formal settlement approved by the court  intends to contest the lawsuit vigorously 
securities class action litigation can result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
federal litigation in the us district court for the district of minnesota between october  and december   several purported shareholder class action suits were filed in federal district court in minnesota 
the court has not yet certified any class 
the federal court in minnesota appointed a lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff s counsel on february  the consolidated complaint the consolidated complaint alleges  among other things  violations of sections b and a of the exchange act against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
specifically  the consolidated complaint alleges that  among other things  between july  and july  the class period  defendants made false and misleading statements and or concealed material adverse facts from the market in press releases  presentations and sec disclosures 
the consolidated complaint alleges that our company and the individual defendants misled the market with respect to  among other things our alliance with ibm  our ability to develop certain software  and our expectations regarding certain customer sales 
plaintiffs further allege that defendants manipulated financial statements and failed to disclose problems with existing and potential customer deals  which led to the company s stock price being artificially inflated during the class period 
the plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other unspecified relief 
on may   the company and the individual defendants served a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint 
on january   the court heard arguments on the motion to dismiss  and the parties are currently awaiting a ruling by the court 
we dispute plaintiffs allegations in the consolidated federal class actions in minnesota and believe that the allegations are subject to a variety of meritorious defenses 
we intend to establish a vigorous defense 
while there can be no assurance  and while the outcome of federal class action litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  our management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of the consolidated federal class action litigation in minnesota is unlikely to have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
despite our belief that the consolidated federal class action is without merit  it is possible that the litigation could be resolved adversely 
were the federal court in minnesota to issue a ruling or rulings unfavorable to us  such ruling or rulings could have a material 
table of contents adverse impact on the results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs  or in a period thereafter 
state derivative litigation in the state of minnesota  district court  hennepin county in addition to the above federal litigation  in december two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in state court in hennepin county  minnesota  against certain of our current and former officers and directors  naming us as a nominal defendant 
plaintiffs in both derivative cases have agreed to consolidate their respective actions  although the derivative plaintiffs have not yet filed a consolidated derivative complaint 
the derivative suits claim that certain of our officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders by i selling shares of our common stock while in possession of material adverse non public information regarding our business and prospects  and ii disseminating inaccurate information regarding our business and prospects to the market and or failing to correct such inaccurate information 
the derivative complaints seek compensatory and other damages  restitution  disgorgement  and other legal and equitable relief 
as stated above  the complaints are brought derivatively on our behalf  and consequently do not seek relief from us 
we however  have entered into indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business with certain of the officer and director defendants and may be obligated throughout the pendency of this action to advance payment of legal fees and costs incurred by those defendants pursuant to our obligations under the indemnification agreements and or applicable delaware law 
while there can be no assurance  our management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of the derivative proceedings will not have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  we are unable to predict with certainty the results of the derivative litigation 
legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business in addition to the matters discussed above  we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that the resolution of such matters will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of specified factors  including those set forth in the section entitled factors that may impact future results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we completed our initial public offering on november  prior to the completion of our initial public offering  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of hnc software inc  a business to business software company that developed and marketed predictive software solutions 
on october   hnc announced it had completed its separation of retek from hnc through a pro rata distribution to hnc s stockholders of hnc s entire holding of million shares of our common stock 
after the close of the nasdaq national market on september   hnc stockholders who were stockholders of record as of september  were distributed shares of our common stock for each share of hnc stock held as of the record date 
we generate revenue from the sale of software licenses  maintenance and support contracts  professional consulting and contract development services 
until the fourth quarter of  we generally licensed products to customers on a perpetual basis and recognized revenue upon delivery of the products 
we revised the terms of our software licensing agreements for a substantial portion of our license revenues 

table of contents under the revised terms  we provide technical advisory services after the delivery of our products to help customers exploit the full value and functionality of our products 
revenue from the sale of software licenses under these agreements is recognized over the period the technical advisory services are performed if all other criteria for recognition of revenue are met 
these periods of technical advisory services generally range from to months  as determined by each customer s objectives 
deferred revenue consists principally of the unrecognized portion of amounts received under license and maintenance service agreements 
deferred license revenue is recognized ratably over the technical advisory period if applicable  on a percentage of completion basis  or when all criteria for recognition of revenue are met based on the contract terms 
deferred maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service agreement 
customers who license our software generally purchase maintenance contracts  typically covering renewable annual periods 
in addition  customers may purchase consulting services  which are customarily billed at a fixed daily rate plus out of pocket expenses 
contract development services  including new product development services  are typically performed for a fixed fee 
we also offer training services that are billed on a per student or per class session basis 
significant trends and developments in our business economic conditions in the retail industry 
recently  we have faced new challenges as the result of weakened worldwide economic conditions 
we believe that these global economic conditions have resulted in substantial reductions in information technology spending by our customers and potential customers  and have delayed the closing of some software license transactions 
weakened global economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  lengthen our selling cycles and negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
new products and markets 
our customers have indicated to us the importance of good information technology solutions at the retail store level because store operations are the largest component of operating expenses incurred by retailers 
in  we acquired substantially all of the technology of chelsea market systems  llc chelsea  which included a point of sale software solution 
with this acquisition  we acquired a point of sale solution that  when combined with our existing product suite  allows us to better address our customers technology requirements in the store 
also  at the end of the first quarter  we introduced our retek solution  which is designed to make our products work together more effectively  and therefore increase their value to customers and potential customers 
we are continuing to focus on the tier retail market  but in and continuing in  we also increased our sales and marketing efforts in the mid market 
we consider the tier retail market to be retail companies with annual revenues in excess of billion and mid market to be retail companies with annual revenues from million to billion 
we have recently experienced increased sales activity in the mid market that we would expect to continue to contribute to revenue in future periods 
we believe that our new store offerings  such as the point of sale offering  have contributed to the increase in sales activity in the tier market 
mix of domestic and international business 
revenue attributable to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
we believe that this level of international sales is a result of investments we have made in our sales and marketing presence in europe and asia  as well as a growing acceptance of packaged software solutions by retailers outside of north america 
although we cannot be certain that this trend toward a larger percentage of our sales being derived from international customers will continue  we believe that our investments in international sales and marketing strengthen our competitive position in these markets 
growth in our customer base 
we believe that the growth of our customer base is primarily attributable to our increased market penetration and the breadth of our solution suite 
our investments in research and development and acquisitions and alliances have helped us bring these new software solutions to the market 
most recently  our acquisition of substantially all of the technology of chelsea is an 
table of contents example of a new product offering that has expanded our market opportunity  with the offering of a point of sale solution based upon an easy to use java architecture 
although we also intend to expand the number of solutions sold to existing customers  we expect our product expansion and sales and marketing efforts to result in continued growth in our customer base 
customer funded product development on an on going basis  we undertake new product development work that is fully funded by one or more of our customers 
this gives us an opportunity to incorporate real world best business practices into a product that we are able to sell to existing customers and prospects as soon as it is completed 
we have developed several products in this way and expect we will continue to use this method to expand and enhance our product set 
development relationship with accenture on february   we entered into several new long term agreements with accenture 
accenture will provide us with a portion of our required development resources to make custom modifications of our software and to develop software that is funded by customers 
additionally  accenture hired the employees in our training  translation and documentation departments and will provide resources to us in these areas as an outsourcing partner 
in order to obtain competitive rates  we have agreed to utilize a certain minimum number of annual development days of accenture resources 
our minimum payments in are million 
we entered into these agreements to manage the variability in the demand for certain services and to enhance our ability to provide solutions to customers at competitive rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which superseded sab we recognize software license revenue upon meeting each of the following criteria execution of a license agreement or contract  delivery of software  the license fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the proceeds is assessed as being probable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately  or if not yet sold separately  is established by authorized management 
in arrangements where we do not have vsoe for all elements and we are not selling technical advisory services  we follow the residual method 
for a substantial portion of our software license products sold  we provide technical advisory services after the delivery of our products to help our customers exploit the full value and functionality of our products 
revenue from the sale of software licenses under these agreements is recognized over the period that the technical advisory services are performed as no vendor specific 
table of contents objective evidence of fair value exists for advisory services 
these periods of technical advisory services generally range from to months  as determined by each customer s objectives 
for sales made through distributors  resellers and original equipment manufacturers we recognize revenue at the time these partners report to us that they have sold the software to the end user and all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period service revenue  including consulting and training services  is recognized as services are performed 
consulting services are customarily billed at a fixed daily rate plus out of pocket expenses 
our revenue from contract development services is generally recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs at completion  which requires management estimates and judgments 
amounts received under contracts in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
contract losses are recorded as a charge to income in the period such losses are first identified 
unbilled accounts receivable are stated at estimated realizable value 
deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred license and maintenance revenue 
deferred tax assets as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgement is required in determining whether any valuation allowance should be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
during the three months ended september   we determined that it was appropriate to record a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
the establishment of a full deferred tax valuation allowance was determined to be appropriate in light of revenue decreases in the third quarter of  our operating losses for the three and nine months ended september   our expectation of a significant loss for the full year and the added uncertainty of the market in which we operate 
as of december   we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million 
we expect to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our future results of operations 
we will continue to evaluate the need for a full valuation allowance  which will involve substantial management judgment 
despite the full valuation allowance  the income tax benefits related to these deferred tax assets will remain available to offset future taxable income 
allowance for doubtful accounts our software license and installation agreements and commercial development contracts are primarily with large customers in the retail industry 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december  and  we have an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the aggregate value of our net property and equipment and net intangible assets was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including in process research and development  of acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million as of both december  and accrued restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of  we began implementation of a restructuring plan intended to bring our operating expenses in line with expected revenues due to concerns with a weakening global economy and decreasing capital expenditures by retailers 
actions taken included a reduction of our workforce and a reduction in the amount of leased space 
the restructuring plan included workforce reductions of employees across most business functions and geographic regions and all employees were notified in of benefits to be received 
we recorded a charge for severance and related benefits of million in the fourth quarter of we recorded an additional charge of million in to reflect adjustments to final severance benefits paid 
as of december   all payments had been made to the severed individuals 
we also recorded a net loss on lease abandonment of million in the fourth quarter of in the third quarter of we recorded a million reduction to the estimated lease abandonment charges 
the lease abandonment loss recorded in the fourth quarter of consisted of the payments to be made for the remaining lease term of the abandoned space aggregating million  net of estimated sublease income of million 
lease terms of the leased space abandoned range from five to eleven years 
management has made its best estimates of expected sublease income over the remaining term of the abandoned leases 
the estimated sublease income amount is highly subjective and includes assumptions regarding the periods of sublease and the price per square foot to be paid by the sublessors 
as required by the applicable accounting standards  we will review these estimates each quarter and make adjustments  as necessary  to reflect management s best estimates 
as of december   the remaining accrual for lease obligations and terminations is million 
results of operations understanding our major revenues and expenses revenues we record revenues for the sale of software licenses  maintenance  and services 
license revenues may be recognized by one of three methods based on the elements of the arrangement and contract terms ratably over the technical advisory period  upon delivery if all other criteria are met  or as services are performed on a percentage of completion basis 
software licenses are generally sold with technical advisory services and revenues are ratably spread over the length of the advisory services 
for example  a million license contract sold with technical advisory services of fifteen months would be recognized at a rate of million per month over the period 
table of contents of the technical advisory services 
if that same contract were recognized upon delivery  million would all be recognized during the reporting period 
if the million contract revenues were recognized using the percent complete method the amount of revenue would be based on how much of the work was completed in a period related to the license 
thus  if of the total estimated work was completed during the reporting period  million would be recognized as revenue 
fluctuations in license revenues between periods whether increasing or decreasing are influenced by the following factors the length of the technical advisory periods 
technical advisory periods generally run from twelve to twenty four months depending on the goals of the customer 
if a license contract has a shorter advisory period  the amount of revenue recognized will be higher on a monthly basis  whereas if the technical advisory period is longer  the amount of license revenue recognized on a monthly basis will be less 
increases or decreases in license revenue may be dependent upon the number of license contracts being recognized 
because we recognize revenue in monthly amounts over a period of time there are layers of revenue being recognized 
thus  an increase or decrease in revenues is not only dependent upon the size of the contracts but the number of contracts being concurrently recognized 
fluctuations in our revenues may result from the rate at which we add more contracts  or layers of revenue  as other are taken away because they are fully recognized 
timing of contracts signed 
depending on when a contract is signed  it may not have an impact on the reported period s results 
many of our contracts are signed in the last month of the quarter  thus  major contracts may not impact the period in which they are signed 
the mix of license revenues recognized upon shipment or percent complete may impact our revenues 
if proportionately more contracts are signed without technical advisory services  this may materially affect our revenue recognition during the quarter 
in the case of recognition based on shipment  this may materially increase the period revenues 
an increase in percent complete license revenues would cause revenues to fluctuate depending on the amount of work that could be completed on those projects 
if there is a shift in license contracts that adds proportionately more or less percent complete arrangements or more or less software revenues that are recognized upon shipment  revenue streams may be materially affected both in the current period and in the outlook of the future periods 
maintenance revenues are typically recognized ratably over the longer of the maintenance period or over the technical advisory period associated with the maintenance revenue streams 
services revenue is typically recognized on a time and materials basis as services are performed 
expenses employee and related costs represent our largest expense and software engineers represent the largest segment of our employees 
we manage our software engineers as a resource pool to be applied against the demands of our business 
software engineers have many differing skills and expertise that create sub sets within this resource pool 
software engineers work in many different capacities within our organization and therefore associated costs are included in many line items in our statement of operations including cost of license and maintenance  cost of services and others  research and development  and sales and marketing 
we assign software engineers in our resource pool to projects across the organization based on demand regardless of what statement of operations line item is charged the applicable cost 
as a result  the number of software engineers working on a license and maintenance project may quickly change to a 
table of contents research and development project based on the individual project needs 
we may have a reduction in the total number of software engineers during a period  but personnel and related expenses for a certain line item may increase because the remaining software engineers work on projects based on need and demand 
projects are assigned to a statement of operations line item based on the type of project involved 
another significant expense is third party consultant costs 
generally  third party consultants are software engineers utilized to supplement  or in place of  our employee software engineers 
third party consultants are used on an as needed basis depending on the availability and skills of internal resources and our ability to leverage our relationships with third party integrators 
third party consultants offer flexibility to meet our programming needs without increasing fixed costs

table of contents years ended december   and revenue total revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in total revenue in decreased primarily due to a drop in license revenue  which was partially offset by an increase in service revenues 
total revenue increased in primarily due to an increase in services and other revenues 
license and maintenance revenue 
license and maintenance revenue decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in license revenue decreased in due to a slow down in the us and world economies and our potential customers are more deliberately evaluating software solutions  which has extended our sales cycles 
although there was some improvement throughout  economic conditions remain difficult for retailers and this affects their willingness to make larger capital expenditures 
maintenance revenues decreased million in to million 
the decrease is primarily due to one customer not renewing their maintenance agreement  because the customer made a strategic decision to outsource all it functions to a third party provider 
this decrease was partially offset by our increasing base of customers that purchase software maintenance from us 
the increase in license and maintenance revenues as compared to revenues was due to an increase in maintenance revenues offset by a decrease in license revenues 
license revenues decreased due to the difficult economic conditions for retailers as noted previously 
maintenance revenue increased in to million due to a growing base of customers that have installed our software solutions 
services and other revenue 
services and other revenue increased to million in and to million in from million in the increase in services and other revenue in was due to several large concurrent projects being serviced by us during the year as well as an increase in our contracted rates 
consulting and custom development revenue increased million for the year ended december  and was partially offset by decreases in various services and other revenues 
we have relationships with third party integrators and consultants that contract either with us or directly with our customers for services and other integration needs 
our customer s proportionate use of our service offerings or other third party integrators and consultants may cause our services revenue to vary independently of changes in license and maintenance revenue 
however  for the increases in services and other revenues was directly related to our increasing customer base and the demand by retailers to customize functionality in our software to their operating needs 
for  the increase in services and other revenue was due to our expanding customer base  as consulting and custom development increased million over cost of revenue cost of license and maintenance revenue 
cost of license and maintenance revenue consists of fees for third party software products that are integrated into our products  third party license development costs  salaries and related expenses of our customer support organization  other infrastructure costs and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expense 
cost of license and maintenance revenue decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in the decrease in cost of license and maintenance revenue in was due to a million decrease in third party consultant costs  a million decrease in non cash amortization and a million decrease in overhead allocation 
third party consultants were used in to help with several funded development contracts that were mostly completed 
we anticipate the use of additional third party consultant resources to complete pending funded development contracts 
non cash amortization decreased because several intangible assets were fully amortized in our overhead costs decreased due to our restructuring efforts 
because we abandoned leased space with our restructuring in and recorded a loss at that time  we now have less rent expense allocated 
the increase in cost of license and maintenance revenues in was due to a million increase in personnel and related costs  a million increase in third party purchased software and a million increase in amortization of stock based compensation and purchased software  which was offset by a million decrease in third party consultant costs  and in 
table of contents addition  contained million in asset impairment charges for which similar charges did not occur in as a percentage of license and maintenance revenue  cost of license and maintenance revenue increased to in from for the corresponding prior year 
this is due to both the amount and proportion of funded development and maintenance revenues as compared to total license and maintenance revenues in funded development and maintenance revenues typically have lower margins than license revenues 
the increase in percentage costs of license and maintenance revenues for is due to an increase in funded development projects as well as funded development revenues represent a larger proportion of total license and maintenance revenues over the prior year 
in addition maintenance revenues in represented a larger proportion of total license and maintenance revenues 
cost of services and other revenue 
cost of services and other revenue include salaries and related expenses of our consulting organization  cost of third parties contracted to provide consulting services to our customers and an allocation of facilities and depreciation expense 
cost of services and other revenue increased to million in and to million in from million in the increase in cost of services and other revenues in was primarily due to a million increase in third party consulting costs 
third party consultants are used on an as needed basis depending on the availability and skills of internal resources and our ability to leverage our relationships with third party integrators 
also  demand for third party consultants fluctuates due to the location of our services customers 
service projects for international customers are typically staffed by local third party consultants  rather than internal resources  thus as we continue to expand our international customer base  we may increase our use of third party consultants 
as a percentage of services and other revenue  the cost of services and other revenue decreased to  from for the corresponding prior year 
this increase in margins was due to higher billing rates for our services 
the increase in cost of services and other revenue during was due to the additional personnel and related costs offset by a decrease in third party consultant expense 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of salaries and related costs of our software engineering organization  fees paid to third party consultants and an allocation of facilities and depreciation expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in the decrease in research and development expenses in was due a million decrease in personnel and related expenses  million decrease in non cash compensation expenses and a million decrease in employee development  which were partially offset by a million increase in third party consultant costs 
the decrease in personnel and related costs was due to our restructuring efforts initiated in non cash charges decreased because the deferred stock based compensation related to certain stock option grants were fully amortized in the increase in third party consultant costs for was due to our need to staff certain development projects that could not be staffed internally 
we use third party consultants on an as needed basis  in particular if our internal resources are not sufficient to complete the necessary development activities 
we anticipate leveraging third party consultants in the future to assist in certain development activities 
the increase in research and development expenses in was due to a million increase in personnel and related costs and million in third party consultant costs primarily due to the costs associated with completing various components and enhancing the capabilities of retek  as well as an increase in facilities costs due to our move to our new corporate facilities 
these increases were offset by a decrease in amortization of stock based compensation 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and the related costs of our sales and marketing organization  sales commissions  costs of our marketing programs  including public relations  advertising  trade shows  collateral sales materials  our customer user reference group program  rent and facilities costs associated with our regional and international sales offices and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in and to million in from million in the decrease in sales 
table of contents and marketing expense in was due to a million decrease in employee and related costs  a million decrease in direct allocation depreciation  a million decrease in overhead allocation  a decrease in corporate marketing  a million decrease in recruiting and a million decrease in non cash compensation 
the decrease in personnel and related costs as well as overhead allocation was due to our restructuring efforts initiated in we had fewer personnel and less total overhead costs 
this decrease in personnel also affected our recruiting programs as we had fewer employee hires in the decrease in direct allocation depreciation was due to an asset that was fully depreciated as of december   therefore  no such costs were recognized in corporate marketing expenditures decreased as we re evaluated and subsequently discontinued certain marketing programs 
non cash charges decreased because the deferred stock based compensation related to certain stock option grant was fully amortized in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in was due to a million decrease in personnel and related expenses and a million decrease in marketing programs 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses related to the expansion of our sales presence in several international locations including korea  hong kong and japan 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our sales staff and market new product introductions 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs from our finance and human resources organizations  third party professional service fees and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in and to million in from million in general and administrative expenses decreased in due to a million decrease in professional services and a million decrease in personnel and related expenses 
additionally  general and administrative expenses decreased due to a million decrease in bad debt expense for a note receivable that was incurred in the decrease in professional services is primarily due to less legal costs incurred to defend against various claims against us 
the decrease in personnel and related costs was due to our restructuring efforts initiated in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to charges incurred in related to our move to our new corporate facilities 
in we had a million charge to write off obligations and assets on space we abandoned and this caused a decrease in general and administrative expenses relative to this decrease was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses in from a million bad debt expense for a note receivable and million in accelerated depreciation for assets abandoned under our restructuring plan 
impairment of intangible asset 
the impairment of intangible assets during relates to the intangible asset acquired from henderson ventures  inc henderson 
because our relationship with henderson has not generated software sales for us to date and because of the increasing uncertainty about retailers future capital investments and other factors  we determined that an evaluation of the recoverability of the intangible asset related to henderson was appropriate during the third quarter as a result  we determined that no significant future cash flows are probable from our relationship with henderson and the net book value of the intangible asset related to the software development and distribution agreement of million was impaired and was written off during the third quarter of acquisition related amortization of intangibles 
in connection with our purchase of hightouch technologies  inc in  the application of the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition resulted in an excess of cost over net assets acquired of million  of which million was allocated to intangibles  million was allocated to goodwill and million was allocated to in process research and development 
in conjunction with the purchase  we recorded various intangible assets  which are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years 
in connection with the purchase of webtrack limited in  the application of the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition resulted in an excess of cost over net assets acquired of million  of which million was allocated to intangibles  million was allocated to goodwill and million was allocated to in process research and development 
in conjunction with the purchase  we recorded various intangible assets  which are being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years 

table of contents restructuring and other in the fourth quarter of  we began implementation of a restructuring plan intended to bring our operating expenses in line with expected revenues due to concerns with a weakening global economy and decreasing capital expenditures by retailers 
actions taken included a reduction of our workforce and a reduction in the amount of leased space 
the restructuring plan included workforce reductions of employees across most business functions and geographic regions and all employees were notified in of benefits to be received 
we recorded a charge for severance and related benefits of million in the fourth quarter of we recorded an additional charge of million in to reflect adjustments to final severance benefits paid 
as of december   all payments had been made to the severed individuals 
we also recorded a net loss on lease abandonment of million in the fourth quarter of in the third quarter of we recorded a reduction to the estimated lease abandonment charges 
the lease abandonment loss recorded in the fourth quarter of consisted of the payments to be made for the remaining lease term of the abandoned space aggregating million  net of estimated sublease income of million 
lease terms of the leased space abandoned range from five to eleven years 
management has made its best estimates of expected sublease income over the remaining term of the abandoned leases 
the estimated sublease income amount is highly judgmental and includes assumptions regarding the periods of sublease and the price per square foot to be paid by the sublessees 
as required by the applicable accounting standards  we will review these estimates each quarter and make adjustments  as necessary  to reflect management s best estimates 
as of december   the remaining accrual for lease obligations and terminations is million 
the following table sets forth a summary of the restructuring charges  adjustments to the provision  payment made against those charges and the remaining liabilities as of december  restructuring balance as of adjustments cash balance as of charges cash usage december  to provision usage december  lease obligations and terminations severance and related benefits total related to the lease abandonment charge  we recorded million of accelerated depreciation on equipment and leasehold improvements to be abandoned in  which is recorded as general and administrative expense 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased by million and increased million in the decrease in was primarily due to lower interest income earned during the period 
the increase in other income in was due to an increase in interest income and a decrease in other expense primarily due to fewer penalties and fewer non interest charges related to lines of credit 
income tax provision benefit 
the income tax provision decreased by million in and increased million in from the income tax benefit recorded in during the third quarter of  we determined that it was appropriate to record a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
the establishment of a full deferred tax valuation allowance was determined to be appropriate in light of the magnitude of our revenue decrease  our operating losses  our expectation of significant loss for the full year and the added uncertainty of the market in which we operate 
despite the full valuation allowance  the income tax benefits related to these deferred tax assets will remain available to offset future taxable income 
we expect to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our future results of operations 
through the second quarter of  the tax amounts were 
table of contents based on management s estimates of the effective tax rates to be incurred by us during those respective full years 
the income tax provision for relates to state and foreign income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment balance was million  representing a million increase during this increase is due to a million increase from operations  million from the issuance of common stock through employee stock option exercises and proceeds from shares issued through our employee stock purchase plan and million from foreign currency gains  which was partially offset by million of purchases of property and equipment 
our cash requirements for servicing debt will be less than million in cash from operations is primarily the difference between cash payments from customers to us and payments we make to vendors and for internal expenses  primarily personnel and related costs of our employees 
net cash provided by operations was million for  net cash used by operating activities was million in and net cash provided by operating activities was million in sources of cash for include operating cash flow adjustments for depreciation and amortization expense  amortization of stock based compensation and bad debt provisions  as well as decreases of accounts receivable and other assets 
uses of cash for were due to net losses and a decrease in accrued liabilities  accrued restructuring and deferred revenue 
uses of cash in were due to an operating loss adjusted to exclude non cash charges and increases in accounts receivable  and decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
sources of cash in  which offset our net loss and an increase in accounts receivable  were depreciation and amortization  increases to the provision for doubtful accounts  amortization of stock based compensation and increases in deferred revenue net cash used by investing activities was million for uses of cash included net purchases of investments for sale and purchases of property and equipment 
the increase in investments for sale was due to the timing of when investments matured and the proceeds used to subsequently purchase additional investments 
we purchase investments designed to protect our capital investment  primarily short term investments that have a low risk of capital loss  such as us government securities  major corporation commercial paper  money market securities and tax exempt municipal securities 
recently our investment mix has included more short term instruments because the difference between short term and long term interest rates is not large enough to justify long term holding periods 
net cash used in investing activities was and million in and  respectively 
in  uses of cash were due to the acquisition of property and equipment  purchase of investments available for sale and cash paid for substantially all of the technology of chelsea 
in  uses of cash were due to the acquisition of property and equipment and purchases of investments available for sale  which were partially offset by the sale of investments available for sale 
the increase in purchases of investments was due to our investing cash in higher yielding investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in sources of cash were primarily due to the issuance of common stock through employee stock option exercises and proceeds from shares issued through our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities in and were due to the issuance of common stock for employee stock option exercises and stock plan purchases 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
operating cash flows would be negatively impacted if we were unable to sign new customer contracts or if a significant number of customers were unable to pay for our solutions and services 
consumer spending  consumer confidence and other economic measures in the us economy impact our customer base in the retail industry and negative trends in these measures may impact the amount and type of capital expenditures made by them 

table of contents management intends to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
a portion of our cash could also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or otherwise to obtain the right to use complementary technologies or data 
we regularly evaluate  in the ordinary course of business  potential acquisitions of such businesses  products  technologies or data

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities  for which they do not have controlling interests through voting or other rights  if they are determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of variable economic interests 
fin provides guidance for determining the primary beneficiary for entities with multiple economic interests 
fin is effective at the time of investment for interests obtained in a variable economic entity after january  beginning in fiscal year  fin  as amended  will be applied to interests in variable interest entities vies acquired prior to february  we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of fin no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if we enter into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future  our consolidated financial position or results of operations may be adversely effected 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents factors that may impact future results of operations and market price of our common stock an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
investors evaluating us and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form k before purchasing our common stock 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
investors could lose all or part of their investment as a result of these factors 
as defined in the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  except for the historical information contained herein  some of the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements regarding future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described by such statements 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet expectations  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
in addition  significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may harm our business operations by making it difficult to implement our budget and business plan 
factors  many of which are outside of our control  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the size and timing of customer orders  which can be affected by customer budgeting and purchasing cycles  the demand for and market acceptance of our software solutions  competitors announcements or introductions of new software solutions  alliance agreements  services or technological innovations  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  customer deferral of material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions  our success in expanding our sales and marketing programs  technological changes or problems in computer systems  general economic conditions which may affect our customers capital investment levels  and our ability to reduce expense levels if our revenues decline and our ability to implement our restructuring plan 
we currently derive a significant portion of our license revenue in each quarter from a small number of relatively large orders and we generally recognize revenue from our licenses over the related technical advisory services period 
if we are unable to recognize revenue from one or more substantial license sales for a particular fiscal quarter  our operating results for that quarter would be seriously harmed and our visibility for revenue deferred into future quarters would be reduced 
in addition  the license of our products typically involves a substantial commitment of resources by our customers or their consultants over an extended period of time 
the time required to complete an implementation may vary from customer to customer and may be protracted due to unforeseen circumstances 
because our revenues from implementation  maintenance and training services are largely correlated with our license revenue  a decline in license revenue may also cause a decline in our services revenue in the same quarter and in subsequent quarters 
because our sales cycle is long  we may have difficulty predicting when we will recognize revenue 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below expectations  the price of our common stock could fall substantially and we could become subject to additional securities class action litigation 
litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s 
table of contents attention and resources  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  our reporting period operating results would also be impacted if our customers did not purchase technical advisory support with our software solutions 
with technical advisory support  revenues are recognized ratably over the advisory period  if all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
without the advisory services  revenues would be recognized when we execute the license agreement or contract  deliver the software  determine that collections of the proceeds is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate revenue to undelivered elements of the arrangement 
using these criteria  rather than our current revenue recognition policy with advisory services  could materially impact period over period results in our consolidated financial statements 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  compensation expense in connection with our grants of options under our equity incentive plan  our hightouch technologies  inc stock option plan and our directors stock option plan 
this expense will be amortized over the vesting period of these granted options  which is generally four years  resulting in lower quarterly income 
our quarterly expense levels are relatively fixed and are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenue 
as a result  if revenue levels fall below our expectations  net income will decrease because only a small portion of our expenses varies with our revenue 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded restructuring charges and enacted certain cost reduction measures in response to the downturn in our financial results 
if our restructuring plans and our cost reduction measures fail to achieve the desired results or result in unanticipated negative consequences  we may suffer material harm to our business 
in response to the recent downturn in our financial performance  we implemented restructuring plans and cost reduction measures to reduce our cost structure  which included workforce and facilities reductions 
our cost reduction measures may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce  reduced employee morale and decreased productivity  and may result in incidental employment related litigation 
the workforce reductions impacted employees directly responsible for sales and research and development  which may affect our ability to close revenue transactions with our customers and potential customers and may affect our ability to finish development efforts on a timely basis 
further  sales force reductions will require an increase in sales resource productivity in order for us to achieve revenue projections 
the failure to retain and effectively manage our remaining employees could increase our costs  hurt our development efforts and impact the quality of our customer service and products 
failure to achieve the desired results of our strategic cost reduction initiatives or sufficiently reduce our workforce would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our current products are not continued to be accepted or we do not respond adequately to our industry s rapid pace of change  sales of our products may decline 
our business depends on the successful customer acceptance of our products and we expect to continue to depend on revenue from existing  new and enhanced versions of our products 
in addition  our business would be harmed if our target customers do not adopt and or expand their use of our products 
in addition  potential customers are evaluating solutions more deliberately  which has resulted in extending our sales cycles 
if we are unable to develop new software solutions or enhancements to our existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  or if new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  our sales may decline 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to predict because the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change and changing customer needs 
the 
table of contents introduction of products employing new technologies could render our existing products or services obsolete and unmarketable 
in developing new products and services  we may fail to respond to technological changes in a timely or cost effective manner  encounter products  capabilities or technologies developed by others that render our products and services obsolete or noncompetitive or that shorten the life cycles of our existing products and services  experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new products and services  or fail to achieve market acceptance of our products and services 
if we fail to establish  maintain and expand our relationships with third parties who implement our products  our ability to meet our customers needs could be harmed 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely on a number of third parties to implement our software solutions at certain customer sites 
if we are unable to establish and maintain effective  long term relationships with these implementation providers or if these providers do not meet the needs or expectations of our customers  our revenue will be reduced and our customer relationships will be harmed 
our current implementation partners are not contractually required to continue to help implement our software solutions 
our software products perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the enterprise 
implementation of our software solutions can also be a lengthy process 
we may be unable to establish or maintain relationships with third parties having sufficient qualified personnel resources to provide the necessary implementation services to support our needs 
if third party services are unavailable  we will be required to provide these services internally  which would significantly limit our ability to meet customers implementation needs and would increase our operating expenses and could reduce gross margins 
a number of our competitors have significantly more established relationships with these third parties and  as a result  these third parties may be more likely to recommend competitors products and services rather than our own 
in addition  we cannot control the level and quality of service provided by our current and future implementation partners 
significant issues implementing our solutions could result in client dissatisfaction and could therefore cause delays or prevent us from collecting fees from our customers and could damage our ability to attract new customers 
we have been named a defendant in securities class action litigation and derivative actions and we may in the future be named in additional litigation  which may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
as described in part i item legal proceedings  a number of shareholder class action suits have been filed naming the company and or certain of our current and former officers and directors as co defendants 
two additional related derivative action suits have been filed on our behalf naming certain of our officers and directors 
we believe these claims are subject to a variety of meritorious defenses  which we intend to vigorously pursue 
however  it is possible that the litigation could be resolved adversely  could result in substantial costs and could divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business 
more generally  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following declines in the market price of its securities 
this risk is greater for technology companies  which have experienced greater than average stock price declines in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
while we 
table of contents maintain director and officer insurance  the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient for any such claim and the continued availability of such insurance cannot be assured 
we may in the future be the target of this kind of litigation and such litigation could also result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our ability to grow our business could be harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend significantly upon our ability to attract  integrate  motivate and retain skilled sales  research and development  marketing and management personnel 
competition for skilled personnel is intense and the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  retaining and motivating the personnel required to grow and operate profitably 
failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel would adversely affect our business 
the recent trading levels of our stock have decreased the value of our stock options granted to employees under our stock option plans 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek alternate employment  such as with larger  more established companies or companies that they perceive as having less volatile stock prices 
continuity of personnel can be a very important factor in sales and implementation of our software and completion of our product development efforts 
attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce our prices  which would reduce our revenue and or operating margins 
the market for our software solutions is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell products and services on terms favorable to us 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce prices  which would reduce our revenues and or operating margins 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  development or other resources and greater name recognition than us 
in addition  these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies that could compel us to reduce the prices of our products and services in response 
our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive  make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  which would increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our customers  and establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  which would limit our ability to sell products through these channels 
as a result  we may not be able to maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the retail industry 
we have in the past derived substantially all of our revenues from the license of our software products and the delivery of related services to retail customers 
our future growth and profitability is dependent upon increased sales to retailers 
recent world wide economic conditions and competitive pressures in the retail industry have negatively impacted demand for our products and services 
such competitive pressures and softness of economic conditions could continue to cause retail customers and potential customers to 
table of contents delay  cancel or reduce their information technology budgets and their spending on our software products and services 
if we fail to obtain access to the intellectual property of third parties  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we must now  and may in the future have to  license or otherwise obtain access to the intellectual property of third parties  including microstrategy  wavelink  seebeyond  lucent  sun  ibm  accenture and oracle 
our business would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license such software cease to deliver and support reliable products or enhance their current products 
in addition  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or prices or at all 
our inability to maintain or obtain this software could result in shipment delays or reduced sales of our products 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings 
either alternative could seriously harm business and operating results 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  our competitors may gain access to our technology and we may lose customers 
we depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
to protect proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  trade secrets  and copyright and trademark laws 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy may be a problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we intend to vigorously protect intellectual property rights through litigation and other means 
however  such litigation can be costly to prosecute and we cannot be certain that we will be able to enforce our rights or prevent other parties from developing similar technology  duplicating our products or designing around our intellectual property 
if  in the future  third parties claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property  we may incur significant costs 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software industry and the internet industry regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future products infringe their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of electronic commerce solutions will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could seriously harm our business and expose us to claims by our customers 
our business is subject to economic  political and other risks associated with international sales 
since we sell products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
to the extent that our sales are denominated in foreign currencies  the revenue we receive could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
if the effective price of the products we sell to our customers were to increase due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  demand for our 
table of contents technology could fall  which would  in turn  reduce our revenue 
we have not historically attempted to mitigate the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our revenue through use of hedging instruments  and we do not currently intend to do so in the future 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  greater risk of uncollectable accounts and longer accounts receivable payment cycles  changes in a specific country s or region s political  legal or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or other localization legal requirements  cost of and difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and foreign language skill limitations  international variations in technology standards  differing levels of protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
continued terrorist attacks or global unrest could lead to further economic instability which could harm our business 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc  on september   and current and future global unrest may adversely affect our business  results of operation  financial condition or future growth 
terrorist attacks and global unrest may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability and could adversely affect economic conditions  particularly in the retail industry 
errors and defects in our products could result in significant costs to us and could impair our ability to sell our products 
our products are complex and  accordingly  may contain undetected errors or failures when we first introduce them or as we release new versions 
this may result in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could cause us to incur significant costs to correct errors or failures or to pay damages suffered by customers as a result of such errors or failures 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in new releases and new products after their introduction 
we have incurred costs during the period required to correct these errors  although to date such costs  including costs incurred on specific contracts  have not been material 
we may in the future discover errors in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments
