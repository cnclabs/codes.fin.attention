item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
historical operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicativ e of trends in operating results for any future period 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company wishes to caution readers that this report contains  and futur e filings by the company  press releases and oral statements made by the company s authorized representatives may contain  forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
readers can identify these forward looking statements by the use of such verbs as expects  anticipates  believes or simila r verbs or conjugations of such verbs 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements due to important factors bearing on the company s business  many of which already have been discussed in this filing and in the company s prior filings 
the differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including  but not limited to  the risk factors described below 
you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties  and all other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  before making an investment in our common stock 
any of th e following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the demand for our products is cyclical  which could adversely impact our revenues 
the end markets for fully assembled bearings are cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production 
as a result  the market for bearing components is also cyclical and impacted by overall levels of industrial production 
our sales in the past have been negatively affected  and in the future will be negatively affected  by adverse conditions in the industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or national economic conditions generally 
we depend on a very limited number of foreign sources for our primary raw material and are subject to risks of shortages and price fluctuation 
the steel that we use to manufacture precision balls and rollers is of an extremely high quality and is available from a limited number of producers on a global basis 
due to quality constraints in the us steel industry  we obtain substantially all of the steel used in our us ball and roller production from overseas suppliers 
in addition  we obtain substantially all of the steel used in our european ball production from a single european source 
if we had to obtain steel from sources other than our current suppliers  particularly in the case of our european operations  we could face higher prices and transportation costs  increased duties or taxes  and shortages of steel 
problems in obtaining steel  and particularly chrome steel  in the quantities that we require and on commercially reasonable terms  could increase our costs  adversely impacting our ability to operate our business efficiently and have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of our company 
we depend heavily on a relatively limited number of customers  and the los s of any major customer would have a material adverse effect on our business sales to various us and foreign divisions of skf  which is one of the largest bearing manufacturers in the world  accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in  and sales to ina fag accounted for approximatel y of consolidated net sales in during  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
none of our othe r customers individually accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales for the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would cause us to lose a substantial portion of our revenue and would lower our operating profit margin and cash flows from operations 
we operate in and sell products to customers outside the us and are subject to several related risks 
because we obtain a majority of our raw materials from overseas suppliers  actively participate in overseas manufacturing operations and sell to a large number of international customers  we face risks associated with the following adverse foreign currency fluctuations  changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  and other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations  the imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions  high tax rates that discourage the repatriation of funds to the us  the imposition of import or other duties or taxes  and unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which our suppliers  manufacturing operations  and customers are located 
we do not have a hedging program in place associated with consolidating th e operating results of our foreign businesses into us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar and or the euro relative to other currencies may adversely affect our ability to compete with our foreign based competitors for international  as well as domestic  sales 
also  a decline in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar will negatively impact our consolidated financial results  which are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  due to the typical slower summer manufacturing season in europe  we expect that revenues in the third fiscal quarter will reflect lower sales  as our sales to european customers have increased as a percentage of net sales 
the costs and difficulties of integrating acquired business could impede our future growth 
we cannot assure you that any future acquisition will enhance our financia l performance 
our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on  among other things  the adequacy of our implementation plans  the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and sales goals 
the integration of any acquired businesses might cause us to incur unforeseen costs  which would lower our profit margin and future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions 
we may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for us t o realize our growth strategy 
acquiring businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy 
this strategy calls for growth through acquisitions constituting approximately three fourths of our future growth  with the remainder resulting from internal growth and market penetration 
we bought our plastic bearing component business in  formed euroball with our two largest bearing customers  skf and ina fag  in and acquired our bearing seal operations in during  we purchased ina fag s minority interest in euroball and during we purchased skf s minority interest in euroball and skf s tapered roller and metal cage manufacturing operations in veenendaal  the netherlands 
see note of the note s to consolidated financial statements 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms in the future 
in addition  we may borrow funds to acquire other businesses  increasing our interest expense and debt levels 
our inability to acquire businesses  or to operate them profitably once acquired  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our growth strategy depends on outsourcing  and if the industry trend toward outsourcing does not continue  our business could be adversely affected 
our growth strategy depends in significant part on major bearing manufacturers continuing to outsource components  and expanding the number of components being outsourced 
this requires manufacturers to depart significantl y from their traditional methods of operations 
if major bearing manufacturers do not continue to expand outsourcing efforts or determine to reduce their use of outsourcing  our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected 
our market is highly competitive and many of our competitors have significant advantages that could adversely affect our business 
the global market for bearing components is highly competitive  with a majority of production represented by the captive production operations of certain large bearing manufacturers and the balance represented by independent manufacturers 
captive manufacturers make components for internal use and for sale to third parties 
all of the captive manufacturers  and many independent manufacturers  are significantly larger and have greater resources than do we 
our competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality  and our ability to remain competitive will depend  among other things  on whether w e are able to keep pace with such quality improvements in a cost effective manner the production capacity we have added over the last several years has at times resulted in our having more capacity than we need  causing our operating costs to be higher than expected 
we have expanded our ball and roller production facilities and capacity over the last several years 
during  we built an additional manufacturing plant in kilkenny  ireland  and we continued this expansion in through the formation of euroball with skf and ina fag 
our ball and roller production facilities have not always operated at full capacity and from time to time our results of operations have been adversely affected by the under utilization of our production facilities  and we face risks of further under utilization or inefficient utilization of our production facilities in future years 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and may decline 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are our operating and financial performance and prospects  quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators  such as earnings per share  net income and revenues  changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  loss of any member of our senior management team  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  sales of our common stock by stockholders  general market conditions  and domestic and international economic  legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
thes e broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware corporate law  contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable and may prevent you from receiving a takeover premium for your shares 
these provisions include  for example  a classified board of directors and the authorization of our board of directors to issue up to  preferred shares without a stockholder vote 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders may not call a special meeting 
we are a delaware corporation subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
generally  this statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder 
we anticipate that the provisions of section may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors  because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if a majority of the directors then in office approve either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 
these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  the market price of our common stock could decline 
overview and management focus our strategy and management focus is based upon the following long term objectives captive growth  providing a competitive and attractive alternative to the operations of our global customers expansion of our bearing product offering  and global expansion of our manufacturing base to better address the global requirements of our customers management generally focuses on these trends and relevant market indicators global industrial growth and economics global automotive production rates costs subject to the global inflationary environment  including  but not limited to raw material wages and benefits  including health care costs energy trends related to manufacturing s geographic migration of competitive manufacturing regulatory environment for united states public companies currency and exchange rate movements and trends interest rate levels and expectations management generally focuses on the following key indicators of operating performance sales growth cost of products sold levels selling  general and administrative expense levels net income cash flow from operations and capital spending our core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality  precision steel balls and rollers 
in  sales of balls and rollers accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales with and of sales from balls and rollers  respectively 
sales of metal bearing retainers accounte d for and sales of precision molded plastic and rubber parts accounted for the remaining 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since our formation in we have grown primarily through the displacement of captive ball manufacturing operations of domestic and international bearing manufacturers resulting in increased sales of high precision balls for quiet bearing applications 
management believes that our core business sales growth since our formation has been due to our ability to capitalize on opportunities in global markets and provide precision products at competitive prices  as well as our emphasis on product quality and customer service 
in  we recognized changing dynamics in the marketplace  and as a result  developed and began implementing an extensive long term growth strategy building upon our core business and leveraging our inherent strengths to better serve our global customer base 
as part of this strategy  we sought to augment our intrinsic growth with complementary acquisitions that fit specific criteria on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets of earsley capital corporation  formerly known as industrial molding corporation imc for consideration of approximately million 
formed in  imc provides full service design and manufacture of plastic injection molded components to the bearing  automotive  electronic  leisure and consumer markets with an emphasis on value added products that take advantage of its capabilities in product development  tool design and tight tolerance molding processes 
imc operates tw o manufacturing facilities in lubbock  texas 
during  imc sold its products to more than customers in different countries 
on july   we formed a majority owned stand alone company in europe nn euroball aps euroball  for the manufacture and sale of chrome steel ball s used for ball bearings and other products 
as a result of this transaction  we owned of euroball 
ab skf and fag kugelfisher georg shafer ag  the parent companies of skf and fag respectively each owned of euroball 
as part of th e transaction  euroball acquired the ball factories located in pinerolo  italy previously owned by skf  eltmann  germany previously owned by fag  and kilkenny  ireland previously owned by the company 
acquisition financing of approximately million euro approximately million was drawn at closing  and the credit facility provided for additional working capital expenditure financing 
in connection with this transaction  total equity  specifically additional paid in capital  increased by million euros million to reflect the increase in our proportionate interest in euroball as related to our ownership as more fully detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have always consolidated euroball due to our majority ownership and have accounted for the acquisitions of the pinerolo  italy and eltmann  germany ball factories in a manner similar to the purchase method of accounting 
on december  we completed the purchase of the interest held by ina fag 
we paid approximately million euros million for ina fag s interest in euroball 
the excess of the purchase price paid to ina fag for its interest over fair value of ina fag s interest in the net assets of euroball of approximately million has been allocated to goodwill see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on may  we acquired the interest in euroball held by skf 
we paid approximately million euros million for skf s interest in euroball the excess of the purchase price paid to skf for its interest over the fair value of skf s interest in the net assets of euroball of approximately million was allocated to goodwill 
on february   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of the delta rubber company  a connecticut corporation delta  for million in cash 
delta provides high quality engineered bearing seals and other precision molded rubber products to original equipment manufacturers 
delta operates two manufacturing facilities in danielson  connecticut 
we have accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method o f accounting 
on september   we announced the closing of our walterboro  south carolina ball manufacturing facility effective december the closing was made as part of our strategy to redistribute our global production in order to better utilize capacity and serve the needs of our worldwide customers 
the precision ball production of the walterboro facility has been fully absorbed by our remaining us ball roller manufacturing facilities located in erwin and mountain city  tennessee 
in and we recorded before tax charges associated with the closing of million and million  respectively 
in  this amount includes a million before tax charge for the recording o f impairment on our manufacturing facility located in walterboro  south carolina and million related to employee severance costs 
in  this amount includes a million before tax charge for the recording of an additional impairment on the facility  a million before tax charge for the recording of impairment on the machinery and equipment and a million charge related to employee severance costs 
there were no impairment charges related to these assets recorded in these amounts are reflected as restructuring and impairment costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the building along with certain machinery and equipment are held for sale as of december  these assets have an aggregate carrying value of million 
the financial results of this operation have been reflected in the domestic ball and roller segment 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective december   we sold our minority interest in jiangsu general ball roller company  ltd  a chinese ball and roller manufacturer located in rugao city  jiangsu province  china 
to effect the transaction  we sold our ownership in nn general  llc  which owns a interest in the jiangsu joint venture to our partner  general bearing corporation for cash of million and notes of million 
in  we recorded a non cash after tax loss on sale of the investments in this joint venture of million on may  we acquired of the tapered roller and metal cage manufacturing operations of skf in veenendaal  the netherlands 
the results of veenendaal s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
we paid consideration of approximately million euros million and incurred other costs of approximately million  for the veenendaal net assets acquired from skf 
the veenendaal operation manufactures rollers for tapered roller bearings and metal cages for both tapered roller and spherical roller bearings allowing us to expand our bearing component offering 
the financial results of the veenendaal operation are included in the nn europe segment 
on october   we acquired certain assets comprised of land  building and machinery and equipment of the precision ball operations of klf gulickare n klf  based in kysucke nove mesto  slovakia 
we paid consideration of approximately million euros million 
the assets will be utilized by our newly established subsidiary nn slovakia based in kysucke nove mesto  slovakia  which will begin production in the financial results of the operations are included in our nn europe segment 
the implementation and successful execution of this acquisition strategy t o date has allowed the company to expand its global presence and positions the company for continued global growth and expansion into core served markets 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgmen t underlying them  are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and post retirement benefits 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not significantly differ from the estimates used in these critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are recorded upon recognition of a sal e of goods and ownership is assumed by the customer 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due primarily from the core served markets bearing manufacturers  automotive industry  electronics  industrial  agricultural and aerospace 
due to the chapter voluntary bankruptcy of one im c customer and other write offs  the company experienced million of bad debt expense during  million during and million during in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  the company continuously perform s credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs when available including the customers financial position  past payment history  relevant industry trends  cash flows  management capability  historical loss experience and economic conditions and prospects 
accounts receivable are written off when considered to be uncollectible 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the company s inventories are not generally subject to obsolescence due to spoilage or expiring product life cycles 
the company operates generally as a make to order business  however  th e company also stocks products for certain customers in order to meet delivery schedules 
while management believes that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  the company could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
acquisitions and acquired intangibles 
for new acquisitions  the company uses estimates  assumptions and appraisals to allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and to determine the amount of goodwill 
these estimates are based on market analyses and comparisons to similar assets 
annual tests are required to be performed to assess whether recorded goodwill is impaired 
the annual tests require management to make estimates and assumptions with regard t o the future operations of its reporting units  the expected cash flows that they will generate  and their market value 
these estimates and assumptions therefor e impact the recorded value of assets acquired in a business combination  including goodwill  and whether or not there is any subsequent impairment of th e recorded goodwill and the amount of such impairment 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment 
the recoverability of the long term assets is dependent on the performance of the companies which the company has acquired  a s well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these acquisitions 
in assessing potential impairment for these assets the company will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance 
for assets held for sale  appraisals are relied upon to assess the fair market value of those assets 
the company estimates that if the assets held for sale were classified as held and used  depreciation expense would have increased approximately million during future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse operating results of the underlying assets could result in the company having to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
pension and post retirement obligations 
the company uses several assumptions i n determining its periodic pension and post retirement expense and obligations which are included in the consolidated financial statements 
these assumptions include determining an appropriate discount rate  rate of compensation increase as well as the remaining service period of active employees 
the company uses a n independent actuary to calculate the periodic pension and post retirement expense and obligations based upon these assumptions and actual employee census data 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected financia l data and the percentage of the company s net sales represented by each income statement line item presented

our net sales increased by million or from million in to million in net sales of the nn europe segment increased million or from million in to million i n sales from our veenendaal  the netherlands tapered roller and metal retainer operation acquired on may  accounted for million of the increase 
impacts of foreign currency translation within the nn europe segment contributed million of the increase 
the remaining increase of million is a result of increased product demand 
net sales of the domestic ball and roller segment increased million or from million in to million in net sales of the plastics and rubber components segment increased million or from million in to million in sales increases in these two segments are a result of increased product demand 
cost of products sold 
our cost of products sold increased by millio n or from million in to million in cost of product s sold of the nn europe segment increased million or from million in to million in cost of products sold from our veenendaal  the netherlands operation accounted for million of the increase and impacts of foreign currency translation accounted for millio n of the increase 
the remaining increase of million within the nn europe segment is principally attributed to increased product demands and material cos t increases 
cost of products sold of the domestic ball and roller segment increased by million due to production costs associated with increased product demand of approximately million and increases in material costs an d export costs of approximately million 
cost of products sold of the plastics and rubber components segment increased million due to production costs associated with increased product demand of approximately million  million related to inventory impairment charges due to the closing of our nn arte business in guadalajara  mexico  and million due to product mix an d insurance expense increases 
as a percentage of sales  cost of products sold increased from in to in the price of steel has risen over the last twelve to eighteen months with prices expected to reflect even greater increases 
prior to that time  steel prices had gradually declined since approximately the increase is principally due to general increases in global demand and  more recently  due t o china s increased consumption of steel 
this has had the impact of increasing scrap surcharges we pay in procuring our steel 
our contracts with key customer s allow us to pass a majority of the steel price increases we incur on to those customers 
however  by contract  material price changes in any given year are passed along with price adjustments in january of the following year 
until the current increases are able to be passed through to our customers  income from operations  net income and cash flow from operations will be adversely affected selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million during to million during selling  general and administrative expenses of the nn europe segment increased million principally due to the acquisition of veenendaal on may  contributing million of the increase and impacts of foreign currency translation accounting for millio n of the increase  offset by decreased spending of million

of this amount  million is related to the acquisition of veenendaal on may  and impacts of foreign currency translation accountin g for million of the increase 
the other million is related to capital spending increases 
offsetting this amount was a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in the plastic and rubber components segment of million related to decreased capital spending within this segment 
there was no change to depreciation and amortization expense within the domestic ball and roller segment 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million or from million in to million in interest expense increased million related to additional borrowings necessary to fund the may  acquisition of veenendaal and million related to the purchase of the minority interests in euroball held by ina fag and skf on december  and may   respectively 
offsetting these increases was a decrease interest expense of million due to debt principal payments and decreased interest rates 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiary 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiary decreased million or from million in to million in the decrease is attributed to the purchase of the minority interests in euroball held by ina fag and skf on december  and may   respectively

increased demand and new programs within the plastic and rubber components segment contributed million of the increase 
additionally  the impact of foreign currency translation within the nn europe segment contributed million of the increase 
in addition to these increases were contractual price decreases and modest volume improvements in the nn europe segment resulting in a net decrease of million 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased by million  or  from million in to million in the inclusion of a full year of delta  acquired in february   contributed million of the increase 
additionally  increases in demand within the plastics and rubber components segment  offset by cost reduction efforts  increased cost of product s sold by million 
impacts related to foreign currency translation increased cost of products sold in the nn europe segment by million which was offset in part  by cost reduction programs of million 
additionally  within the domestic ball and roller segment principally related to the closing of our walterboro  south carolina ball production facility cost of products sold decreased million 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of products sold decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative costs increased by million  or  from million in to million in the inclusion of a full year of delta contribute d million of the increase 
advisory services principally associated with the previously announced desire of certain original founders of the company to liquidate their holdings in the company s stock contributed million of the increase 
other increases totaling million are primarily attributable to incentive based compensation throughout the company and initiatives at euroball offsetting these increases were decreased spending of approximately millio n related to bad debt expense primarily related to the bankruptcy filing of a major plastics segment customer in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by million from million in to million in the adoption of fasb statement no

net gain on involuntary conversion 
the company had a gain on involuntary conversion of million in related to insurance proceeds as a result of the march  fire at the erwin production facility 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiary 
minority interest of consolidated subsidiary increased million from million in to million in this increase is due entirely to the euroball joint venture which has been consolidated since its formation  august  the company is required to consolidate euroball in its consolidated financial statements due t o its majority ownership 
at december   the company owned of the shares of the joint venture with the remaining minority partner owning the remaining 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiary represents the combined interest in euroball s earnings of the minority partners and the interest in nn arte s earnings of the minority partner the interest in nn arte s earning is zero in and

net income 
net income increased million  or from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  net income increased from in to in liquidity and capital resources on may  in connection with the purchase of skf s veenendaal component manufacturing operations and skf s percent interest in euroball  w e entered into a new million syndicated credit facility with amsouth bank amsouth as the administrative agent and suntrust bank as the euro loan agen t for the lenders under which we borrowed million and million euros million 
this new financing arrangement replaces our prior credit facility with amsouth and hypo vereinsbank luxembourg  sa the credit facility consists of a million revolver expiring on march   bearing interes t at a floating rate equal to libor at december  plus an applicable margin of to  a million term loan expiring on may   bearing interest at a floating rate equal to libor at december  plus an applicable margin of to and a million million euros term loan expiring on may  which bears interest at a floating rate equal to euro libor at december  plus an applicable margin of to the loan agreement contains customary financial and non financial covenants 
such covenants specify that we must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  must not exceed a maximum funde d indebtedness to ebitda ratio as well as a maximum funded indebtedness to capitalization ratio and limits the amount of capital expenditures we may make in any fiscal year 
the loan agreement also contains customary restrictions on  among other things  additional indebtedness  liens on our assets  sales or transfers of assets  investments  restricted payments including payment of dividends and stock repurchases  issuance of equity securities  and mergers  acquisitions and other fundamental changes in our business 
the credit agreemen t is un collateralized except for the pledge of stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  the terms of our revolving credit facility restrict the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of certain amounts specified in the credit agreement 
as of december   we were not in compliance wit h certain technical  non financial covenants 
subsequently  the necessary waivers effective as of december   have been received from the participating banks 
except for certain technical  non financial covenants  we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  in connection with this refinancing  capitalized costs in the amount of approximately million associated with the paid off credit facilities were written off and are include d as a component of other income expense 
we incurred approximately millio n of debt issue costs as a result of entering into this credit facility 
during may  we completed a public offering of million shares of our stock by a group of selling shareholders 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares previously held by the group of selling shareholders  however  the underwriters did exercise their over allotment optio n of  shares  which were offered by us 
net proceeds received by us in connection with the exercise of the over allotment option were approximately million  net of issue costs 
per the terms of our credit facility  we repaid a portion of our credit facility with these proceeds 
to date  cash generated by nn europe and its subsidiaries has been used exclusively for general  nn europe specific purposes including investments in property  plant and equipment and prepayment of the euro term loan  which is secured by nn europe and its subsidiaries 
accordingly  no dividends have been declared or paid by nn europe that may have been used by the company to pay dow n our domestic credit facilities 
the company s arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide that payments are due within days following the date of the company s shipment of goods  while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreig n customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the company generally provide that payments are due within or days followin g the date of shipment 
under the domestic ball and roller segments inventory management program with certain european customers  payments typically are due within days after the customer uses the product 
the company s sales and receivables can be influenced by seasonality due to the company s relative percentage of european business coupled with many foreign customers ceasing production during the month of august 
for information concerning the company s quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company bills and receives payment from some of its foreign customers in euro as well as other currencies 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations or foreign exchange restrictions 
nonetheless  as a result of these sales  the company s foreign exchange transaction and translation risk has increased 
various strategies to manage this risk are available to management including producing and selling in local currencies and hedging programs
