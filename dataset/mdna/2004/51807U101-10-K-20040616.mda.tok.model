item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k report for the year ended march  forward looking statements 
please refer to the forward looking statements section starting at page of this report and the section entitled factors that may affect future operating results starting at page of this report 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
product sales primarily consist of card sales and sales of read write drives 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time of shipment when shipping terms are fob shipping point  orders are placed pursuant to a pre existing sales arrangement  and there are no post shipment obligations or customer acceptance criteria 
where appropriate  provision is made at the time of shipment for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns 
to date  actual warranty costs and returns activity have not been material 
the company s us government subcontract requires delivery into a secure  government funded vault located on the company s premises 
shipments are made from the vault on a shipment schedule provided by the prime contractor  which is subject to revision  but not cancellation  at the option of the prime contractor 
at the time the cards are delivered into the vault  title to the cards is transferred to the government and all risks of ownership are transferred as well 
the prime contractor is invoiced  with payment due within thirty days  and the contract does not contain any return other than for warranty or cancellation provisions 
pursuant to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue is recognized on delivery into the vault as the company has fulfilled its contractual obligations and the earnings process is complete 
if the company does not receive a shipment schedule for shipment of cards from the vault  revenue is recognized upon shipment from the vault 
in addition  revenue recognition for future deliveries into the vault would be affected if the us government cancels the shipment schedule 
as a result  the company s revenues may fluctuate from period to period if the company does not continue to obtain shipment schedules under this subcontract or if the shipment schedules are cancelled 
license revenue  which may consist of up front license fees and long term royalty payments  is recognized as revenue when earned 
the second source card manufacturing license sold in april to global investments group provides for royalty payments to the company for each card produced during the year term of the license agreement 
this is a multi element arrangement as described in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue derived from the up front payments will be recognized from time to time over the term of the license 
the cost of license revenue is not material and is included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
revenue from the license of the company s software products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable  and  if applicable  upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that management believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  the company includes an expense within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  the company recorded a tax benefit of  which included a  reduction to the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets  net of federal alternative minimum taxes  based on management s assessment that such portion of its deferred tax assets would more likely than not be realized 
due to the company s recent cumulative tax loss history for the three year period ending march   income statement loss history over the past five quarters  and the difficulty in forecasting the timing of future revenue as evidenced by the deviations in achieved revenues from expected revenues during the past few quarters and taking into account the newness of certain customer relationships  the company determined it was necessary to increase the valuation allowance under sfas no 
to the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
as a result  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   which includes a charge to increase the valuation allowance against the beginning of the year net deferred tax asset balance of  for the year ended march   due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets 
in addition the company recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset generated during fiscal in the amount of  the company s methodology for determining the realizability of its deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income  the estimated impact of future stock option deductions  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
these estimates are based on near term projections and assumptions which management believes to be reasonable 
for recent prior periods  the company had been estimating future taxable income from its core business  which assumed on going business under the us government subcontract for permanent resident cards and laser visa border crossing cards and the canadian government s permanent resident card program  as well as estimated operating expenses to support that level of business  as offset by the estimated impact of future stock option deductions 
the company went back to estimating future taxable income based upon its expectations for the current and next three years because this past core business has not proven to be as stable as the company had believed it to be and because this past core business is expected to represent an increasingly smaller part of the business 
this is because the company expects revenues from these us programs to stabilize at revenue levels lower than had been expected in the past and because the company expects new foreign business  which has fluctuated considerably quarter to quarter  to comprise a larger portion of the core business 
the company has had difficulty in the past  and expects to have continued difficulty in the future  in reliably forecasting its foreign business and the revenue to be received from it 
this  in combination with the anticipated three year cumulative tax loss for the period ended march   has resulted in the company basing its estimates of future income for these purposes to booked orders only 
as circumstances change  the company may in the future be able to revert back to estimating future revenue based upon its forecast revenues rather than only using booked orders  although the company cannot say when this will occur 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  the company considered both the positive and negative evidence regarding its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
positive evidence included having achieved profitability for financial reporting purposes from fiscal through fiscal year other positive evidence included the level of sales and business experienced under the contract with the canadian government s permanent resident card program  prospects in italy and saudi arabia for national identification card programs  the heightened interest in border security initiatives following the events of september   and expected future orders 
negative evidence included the company s reliance on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of its business  the uncertainty in timing of anticipated orders from customers  the impact of future stock option deductions on taxable income  and recent experience of net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused  the loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal and the losses in fiscal  and the prospect of three years cumulative tax net operating losses 
in weighing the positive and negative evidence above  the company considered the more likely than not criteria pursuant to sfas no 
as well as the risk factors related to its future business described under the subheadings dependence on vars and on a limited number of customers  lengthy sales cycles  technological change  and competition as noted in the section entitled factors that may affect future operating results 
as described above  the company concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and as a result increased the valuation allowance to be equal to the full amount of the deferred tax asset as of march  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to adjust the amount of the valuation allowance based on future determinations of whether it is more likely than not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in the valuation allowance would be recorded as an income tax benefit or a reduction of income tax expense or a credit to stockholders equity 
the company s net operating losses available to reduce future taxable income expire on various dates from fiscal through fiscal to the extent that the company generates taxable income in jurisdictions where the deferred tax asset relates to net operating losses that have been offset by a full valuation allowance  the utilization of these net operating losses would result in the reversal of the related valuation allowance in the company s results of operations 
the company would need  of income on its federal income tax return to avoid the expiration of  of the deferred tax asset now set to expire in fiscal inventories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasts of product demand 
demand for read write drives can fluctuate significantly 
in order to obtain favorable pricing  purchases of certain read write drive parts are made in quantities that exceed the historical annual sales rate of drives 
the company purchases read write drive parts for its anticipated read write drive demand and takes into consideration the order to delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such parts 
management s analysis of the carrying value of card and read write drive inventory is performed on a quarterly basis 
with respect to inventory carrying values  the company follows the principles articulated in accounting research bulletin  chapter  inventory pricing  paragraphs through and and other authoritative guidance sab as it relates to determining the appropriate cost basis of inventory and determining whether firm  noncancelable purchase commitments should be accrued as a loss if forecasted demand is not sufficient to utilize all such committed inventory purchases 
as part of the company s quarterly excess obsolete analysis  management also determines whether lower of cost or market adjustments ie  where selling prices less certain costs are not sufficient to recover inventory carrying values are warranted  during fiscal  the company has not recorded any significant lower of cost or market adjustments 
in those instances where the company has recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory  management ensures that such new cost basis is reflected in the statement of operations if that inventory is subsequently sold 
the company s inventory reserves are based upon the lower of cost or market for slow moving or obsolete items 
as a result  the company believes a increase or decrease of sales would not have a material impact on such reserves 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal overview drexler technology corporation is headquartered in mountain view  california 
the company makes and markets high security  durable plastic  lasercard optical memory cards and associated computerized read write drives primarily for use in digital governance programs by the us and foreign governments 
the counterfeit and tamper resistant cards are consumable products because they typically are replaced when the cards expire 
the largest purchaser of lasercard products is anteon international corporation  a value added reseller var of the company 
anteon is the government contractor for lasercard product sales to the us department of homeland security dhs  us department of state dos  us department of defense dod  and the government of canada 
under government contracts with anteon  the dhs purchases us permanent resident cards green cards and dos laser visa border crossing cards bccs  the dod purchases automated manifest system cards  and the canadian government purchases permanent resident cards 
encompassing all of these programs  the company s product sales to anteon represented of total revenues for fiscal ended march   of total revenues for fiscal ended march   and of total revenues for fiscal ended march  revenues for the major government programs are shown below as a percentage of total company revenues fiscal year united states green cards and laser visa bccs canadian permanent resident cards italian carta d identita elettronica cie cards for the government of italy  the company has received orders for cie cards carta d identita elettronica and anticipates orders for a new program for the pse cards permesso di soggiorno elettronico 
as of march   the company has a backlog in the amount of million for cie cards scheduled for delivery through may for phase of this program 
according to program descriptions released by the italian government  cie card orders could potentially reach to million cards per year if phase is fully implemented 
production of us laser visa border crossing cards bccs and us permanent resident cards green cards for the us department of homeland security dhs was delayed at the beginning of fiscal while new artwork for the cards was being designed by dhs 
the artwork change for laser visa bccs was completed in july  and on july   the company announced receipt of an optical memory card order valued at approximately million for laser visa bccs 
the new order called for card production to start immediately and to be completed within four months 
the artwork change for green cards resulted in an order announced by the company on december   valued at approximately million  calling for deliveries through may the company has not received a follow on order for either laser visa bccs or green cards 
as of march   between its own on site inventory and the inventory it owns and maintains in their vault on company premises  the us government has inventories of laser visa bccs and green cards which would last approximately and months  respectively  at the us government s current card personalization rates 
optical memory card revenues for fiscal included approximately million in sales of us green cards and laser visa bccs 
this is less than the approximately million level of revenues the company had previously expected to receive from these programs on an annual basis 
optical memory card revenues for these two programs were approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company anticipates that fiscal optical memory card revenues for these two programs will not exceed million 
the us government is currently personalizing cards at an million annualized run rate 
the value is based upon the company s selling price of cards to anteon 
the company believes that annual revenues under these two programs will approximate the us government personalization rate over time  subject to fluctuations in the level of inventory deemed appropriate by the us government 
the company has established sheet lamination production facilities to make canadian permanent resident cards  italian national id cards  and cards for other potential programs 
this process is currently more labor intensive than its roll lamination process but allows the use of high security offset printing and other special features  resulting in a premium card 
to date  gross margins on the canadian sheet process cards have been less than 
the company believes that over time it will be able to improve margins on cards made by the sheet lamination process  through automation and yield improvements 
in addition  roll lamination card gross margins have been hampered by low sales and production volume 
potential applications for lasercard optical memory card digital governance programs include identification cards in several countries  motor vehicle registration cards in india  and the expansion of current us government id card programs due to the perceived increasing need for enhanced us border security 
during the fiscal third quarter  the company received an order for and delivered  optical memory card read write drives and biometric verification system software for a department of homeland security program 
these  drives and software systems are being deployed by the dhs at us borders  to enable the dhs to read the encoded data on more than million green cards and border crossing cards previously manufactured by the company and issued by the us government since potential us government id programs include the us visitor and immigration status indication technology us visit program 
the company is uncertain whether it will be chosen as a us visit subcontractor directly or through a var teaming partner with accenture  which was announced as the prime contractor for the full implementation of this program on june  since governmental card programs typically rely on government policy making  which in turn is subject to technical requirements  budget approvals  and political considerations  there is no assurance that the us visit program will be implemented as expected or that it will include optical cards in its solution 
in addition to using its own marketing staff  the company utilizes var companies and card distribution licensees for the development of markets and applications for lasercard products 
product sales to vars and licensees consist primarily of the company s optical memory cards and optical card read write drives 
the company also offers for sale  its customized software applications and add on peripherals made by other companies such as equipment for adding a digitized photo  fingerprint  hand template  or signature to the cards 
the vars licensees may add application software  personal computers  and other peripherals  and then resell these products integrated into data systems 
the company is continuing its efforts to recruit new vars and eliminate nonproductive vars 
the company s current five year us government subcontract for green cards and laser visa bccs was announced in june and will expire on may  this subcontract was received by the company through anteon  a lasercard var that is a us government prime contractor  under a competitively bid  government procurement contract 
there is no assurance that a follow on contract will be issued by the dhs upon expiration of the current contract  especially given the advent of the us visit program 
in  the company was awarded a subcontract for production of canada s new permanent resident cards 
shipments began in fiscal and have totaled million as of march  including an order received in april  the company s backlog at that time of million called for deliveries through january in march  the company quoted on a tender issued by the kingdom of saudi arabia for three million cards and read write drives for a secure personal identification card program 
the products would be delivered over a one year period after contract issuance 
the company previously sold read write drives for this program  most of which were shipped in the fiscal second quarter  for installation of the infrastructure required for card issuance  and also has shipped small quantities of optical memory cards for testing and sample purposes 
the first phase contract allows for the procurement of  cards  the balance of which may be purchased after testing is complete 
the second phase contract is expected to be awarded to one of the prime contractors in july  however  there is no assurance that the contract will be issued  that the company would be the selected vendor  or that the company will receive additional orders for this program under any contract that may ultimately be issued by the saudi arabian government 
on march   the company successfully concluded the acquisition of two related german card companies  challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh of rastede  germany  and cards more gmbh of ratingen  germany  including their sales operations in the united states and korea 
these acquisitions provide the company with a card manufacturing base to serve the european  middle eastern  african  and asian markets  supplementing the company s newly expanded manufacturing operations in california 
effective april   the company sold a second source card manufacturing license to the global investments group  based in auckland  new zealand  for card manufacturing in slovenia 
this agreement provides for payments to the company of million for the license over the year term of the license consisting of a five year training support package  followed by an ongoing support phase for an additional years 
additionally  the company is to sell approximately million worth of the required manufacturing equipment and installation support for the new facility to provide a targeted initial manufacturing capacity of million optical cards annually 
the company has received the initial million of payments called for in the agreements  consisting of a partial payment for the equipment of  as of march  and million subsequent to march  global investments group is to pay the company royalties for each card produced during the year term of the license agreement 
start up of the global investments group facility is planned for early revenue will be allocated over the remaining term of the agreement beginning when operation of the factory commences 
as more fully described under liquidity and capital resources  in december  the company raised approximately million in an equity private placement  net of expenses 
the company sold  shares of common stock at  nine month options to purchase  shares of common stock at  and five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at kodak  the company s sole source supplier of raw material for its optical memory card media  announced that it is reducing its emphasis on emulsion based films 
if kodak were to discontinue manufacturing the raw material from which the company s optical memory card media is made  the company would order the maximum amount of final run stock for use while endeavoring to establish an alternate supplier for such raw material  although the purchase price could increase from a new supplier 
the company has purchased a long term supply of the raw material to make mastering loops and believes it has on hand an adequate supply of media raw material on hand and on order to meet anticipated demand 
the company plans to invest approximately million in additional capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures in fiscal  as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
in this regard  the company has entered into ten year leases for two buildings in mountain view  california  totaling  square feet  with average annual lease payments totaling million combined 
one lease is a renegotiation of the lease for an existing leased building and the other lease  signed on january   is for additional space 
rent expense is recorded at the average of the rent payments over the term of the lease 
when the lease payments increase over the lease term  the result is recorded as an accrued liability deferred rent 
at the time the renegotiated lease was signed  there was  of deferred rent associated with the original lease 
this amount is being amortized on a straight line basis over the ten year term of the new lease 
the company occupied the newly leased building in april the company will move out of a smaller building in mid this has resulted in the acceleration of certain leasehold improvement amortization costs for the period from november through may  and in the recognition of approximately  of additional leasehold amortization expense through that period 
fiscal amortization expense for leasehold improvements was  revenues for the fiscal year ended march  the company s total revenues were  compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal product revenues 
the company s product revenues consist of sales of optical memory cards  optical card read write drives  drive accessories  maintenance  peripherals  and other miscellaneous items to approximately customers in four states and foreign countries 
product revenues were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the changes in product revenues over these periods were due primarily to the sale of optical memory cards for the us government s laser visa bcc and green card programs 
optical memory card revenues for these programs were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the company anticipates that fiscal revenues will not exceed million for these two programs 
therefore  additional orders from new and existing programs are needed to increase revenues to pre fiscal levels 
such programs could include those in india  italy  saudi arabia  senegal  costa rica  and the united states 
revenue on optical memory cards totaled million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease for fiscal mainly was due to lower unit volume of card sales 
for fiscal  revenue on read write drives  drive service  and related accessories totaled million compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increase for fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal was due to an increase in unit sales volume for read write drives and higher selling prices resulting from the inclusion of biometric system software 
the sales volume increase for fiscal was primarily the result of an order for and delivery of  optical memory card read write drives and biometric verification system software for a us department of homeland security program 
read write drives comprised of total revenues during fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal license fees and other revenues 
during fiscal  the company entered into a read write drive kits assembly license with a customer in italy  which generated license revenue of  the arrangement was structured whereby the customer agreed to pay a contractually agreed upon fee in exchange for the transfer of technical knowledge and know how and training in the assembly of read write drives 
the training period extended over months  which is the period over which the company recognized the fee as revenue 
also in fiscal  the company recorded revenue of  realized on digital sound patent licenses sold to sony corporation and dolby laboratories  inc the revenues were net of legal costs and third party contingency success fees 
there are no ongoing royalty payments 
fiscal license and other revenue included  representing the unamortized portion of a  nonrefundable distribution license fee received in from a licensee in asia that had committed to purchase a minimum number of optical memory cards for a program in the licensee s country 
the company recorded this fee as deferred revenue and has been amortizing it as revenue in proportion to the actual card purchases by the licensee 
during december  the company determined that  due to the licensee s failure to meet the minimum contractual purchase commitment  the licensee s distribution rights had become unenforceable and that the licensee would no longer be acting as the sole card supplier for that program 
in addition  at that time the company decided it would no longer work with the licensee under the terms of the license agreement 
since there were no further obligations  the company recognized the remaining  of revenue in the quarter ended december  fiscal license and other revenue also included  relating to a payment received in january from a third party that was considering entering into a license agreement with the company  the company originally recorded this payment as deferred revenue 
the third party had subsequently foregone its rights under this agreement due to non performance and  accordingly  the company recognized revenue on this arrangement in the fourth quarter of fiscal there were no license revenues for the fiscal year ended march  however  on april   the company announced the sale of a royalty bearing  optical memory card manufacturing license to the global investments group  of new zealand  for card manufacturing in slovenia 
the license agreement provides for payments to the company of million for the license including a five year training support package  followed by an ongoing support phase for an additional years 
additionally  the company agreed to sell approximately million worth of the required manufacturing equipment and installation support for the new facility to provide a targeted initial manufacturing capacity of million optical cards annually  with options to increase capacity to million cards per year 
the company to date has received the initial million of payments called for in the agreements  consisting of a partial payment for the equipment of  as of march  and million subsequent to march  these payments have been recorded in deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement beginning when operation of the factory commences 
backlog as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards totaled million  compared with a backlog of approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal order backlog as of march  includes orders for the following programs green cards for the us department of homeland security  italian government national id cards cie cards  and canadian government permanent resident cards 
backlog is subject to fluctuation due to having few customers and the timing of orders 
the company has no backlog for read write drives 
in addition  the backlog for challenge card design plastikkarten gmbh and cards more gmbh products and services totaled million euros approximately million as of march  gross margin gross margin on product sales was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal the overall gross profit declined  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal and decreased  from  for fiscal the decrease in gross margin on product sales for fiscal compared with fiscal was due primarily to lower volume of optical memory card sales 
the decrease in gross margin on product sales for fiscal compared with fiscal was due largely to the initial production of cards for the canadian program under a new manufacturing process initiated by the company during fiscal and the larger negative gross margin on read write drive sales  as discussed below 
according to the license effective april  with global investments group  the company will resell million of card manufacturing equipment to this licensee during fiscal and the company expects to realize little gross margin on this sale  which is largely a pass through 
the company will have little cost associated with its global investments group license revenue  therefore  its gross margin will approximate its amortized revenue from the million license fee 
the million in revenue and the associated costs will be amortized over the year term of the license 
optical memory cards 
prior to fiscal  optical memory card gross margins have approximated 
optical memory card gross profit and margins can vary significantly based on average selling price  sales and production volume  mix of card types  production efficiency and yields  and changes in fixed costs 
the gross margin on optical memory cards declined to for fiscal compared with for fiscal and for fiscal the declines for fiscal were primarily due to low sales and production volume and the corresponding underabsorption of fixed costs and the introduction of cards made by a sheet lamination process that currently have lower margins than cards made by the roll lamination process 
the changes in gross profit for fiscal and fiscal were mainly due to changes in sales volume 
read write drives 
in fiscal  the company reduced the selling price for lasercard read write drives by for typical purchase quantities in an effort to develop a broader market and customer base for lasercard optical memory cards 
since fiscal  there has not been a further reduced selling price for these read write drives 
however  in fiscal  the company introduced a new drive with a reduction in price for typical quantities as compared with the previous model 
current and target applications for the company s lasercard typically require a small number of drives relative to the number of cards purchased 
for fiscal  the company had a gross profit on read write drive sales  including biometric system software  of approximately  and a gross margin of compared with a negative gross profit on read write drive sales of approximately  for fiscal and  for fiscal read write drive gross profits increased by  in fiscal due to the inclusion of biometric system software on a per drive basis on the  drive dhs purchase 
during fiscal  the company wrote off read write drive inventory totaling approximately  read write drive gross profit and margins can vary significantly based upon sales and production volume  changes in fixed costs  and the inclusion of optional features and software licenses on a per drive basis 
prior to receipt of the comparatively large read write drive order from the us government in the third quarter of fiscal  read write drive gross profits had been negative  inclusive of fixed overhead costs  due to low sales volume 
the company anticipates that quarterly negative gross profits will recur in the future unless sales volume is sufficient to cover fixed costs 
also  unless per drive system software licenses are included in future orders  the company believes that margins will be below when sales volume is sufficient to result in positive gross profit 
income and expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the increase for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to a  increase in insurance premiums and an increase of  in legal and accounting fees 
the increase for fiscal compared with fiscal included approximately  for increased marketing and selling expenditures  an increase of  in general and administrative expenditures  an increase of  for insurance expenditures  and an increase of  for legal and accounting services 
sg a expenses for fiscal were higher than fiscal levels  mainly due to increases in accounting and legal fees primarily related to due diligence for the acquisition of two companies in germany and increased costs of being a public company 
the company believes that sg a expenses for fiscal will be higher than fiscal levels  mainly due to integration of the acquired companies  increases in marketing and selling expenses  and the cost of compliance with internal control auditing mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
research and engineering expenses r e 
the company is continuing its efforts to develop new optical memory card features and structures  including various sheet lamination card structures  the insertion of contactless chips with radio frequency rf capability  optichip tm  ovd optically variable device products  and associated media development  enhanced optical memory card read write drives and read only drives readers  and new software products in an effort to provide new products that can stimulate optical memory card sales growth 
for example  the company recently has developed a prototype of a lasercard handheld reader 
the company anticipates that these ongoing research and engineering efforts will result in new or enhanced card capabilities  production model read only drives  or drives with advanced security features and lower manufacturing costs  however  there is no assurance that such product development efforts will be successful 
these features are important for the company s existing and future optical memory card markets 
total r e expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the decrease in r e spending for fiscal compared with fiscal is mainly due to the completion of the design for a new read write drive model and a  reduction related to the completion last year of the amortization of design technology transfer costs 
the  decrease for fiscal compared with is mainly due to a reduction in purchased services and prototype expenditures 
increases in r e expenses are anticipated for fiscal for development of production model read only drives  optical memory card media development  and other card and hardware related programs 
other income and expense 
total net other income for fiscal was  consisting of  of interest income  offset by  of expense recorded to mark to market the fair value of common stock options and warrants issued in december total other income was  of interest income for fiscal and  of interest income for fiscal the decrease in interest income for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to the decline in interest rates 
income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax expense of  for fiscal for fiscal  the income tax expense was  for an effective tax rate of  and for fiscal  the income tax benefit was  the company s income tax expense for fiscal was due to increasing the valuation allowance to be equal to the remaining balance of the company s deferred tax asset 
this income tax expense is not a cash item and does not mean that the company owes income taxes  but rather that it no longer can demonstrate that in the future it will likely be able to utilize the tax benefits of previously generated net operating losses 
the methodology for determining the realizability of its deferred tax asset is a critical accounting policy as described under the heading critical accounting policies and in the company s sec filings 
in summary  this methodology considers positive and negative evidence regarding the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
due to the company s recent cumulative tax loss history especially as forecast for the three year period ending march   income statement loss history over the five quarters ended march   and the difficulty in forecasting the timing of future revenue which could lead to positive income on its financial statements and taxable income as evidenced by the deviations in achieved revenues from expected revenues during the past few quarters and taking into account the newness of certain customer relationships  the company determined it was necessary to increase the valuation allowance under sfas no 
to the full amount of the deferred tax asset because its estimated future revenue taking into account only booked orders would not generate sufficient taxable income to realize any of its deferred tax assets 
if the company has taxable income in the future  any unexpired net operating loss income tax carry forward amounts will be utilized to reduce otherwise required income tax payments  and future tax expense  up to the full amount of the deferred tax asset which is currently million 
as of march   the company had recognized all prior tax benefits for income statement purposes 
the income tax benefit for fiscal included a credit of  due to the change in the valuation allowance relating to the federal deferred tax asset  net of federal alternative minimum taxes  partially offset by  for state tax expense 
most of the subsequent million of income tax expense has resulted from increasing the valuation allowance to be equal to the deferred tax assets 
in future years  unless the valuation is reduced  should the company be profitable for income tax purposes  the company will utilize the deferred tax asset to reduce the income tax it would otherwise owe  meaning that its effective tax rate will be zero 
the company has million of deferred tax assets that expire in to the extent they are not utilized to reduce income tax which would be due should the company have profits on its income tax return 
to the extent that the global investments group license agreement generates taxable income and the company is in an overall taxable income position the company would be able to reduce the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of  and a current ratio of to the company also had  in long term investments with original maturities from one year to two and one half years 
cash  short term investments  and long term investments were  at march  and  at march  net cash used in operating activities was  for fiscal compared with net cash used in operating activities of  for fiscal and net cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from fiscal to fiscal is largely due to changes in advance payments from customers and deferred revenue 
cash increased during fiscal due to the proceeds from an equity private placement of common stock  as described below 
cash will fluctuate based upon the timing of advance payments from customers relative to shipments and the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of products 
the company believes that the estimated level of revenues and advance payments over the next months will be sufficient to generate cash from operating activities over the same period 
however  quarterly fluctuations are expected
