item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
on july   we effected a for stock split in the form of a stock dividend one share of common stock paid for every two shares held  paid to shareholders of record on june  all prior period shares  share prices  and income per share figures have been restated to reflect the split 
background we entered the neuromodulation market in through the acquisition of a company that had developed and marketed a radio frequency rf neurostimulation system 
through our initiatives  we developed and launched our next generation neurostimulation system  the renew rf spinal cord stimulation system  in we also recently developed our genesis and genesisxp totally implantable pulse generator ipg spinal cord stimulation systems 
we began selling genesis in europe in and in the us in subsequent to the fda s approval of our pma application in november  and our genesisxp ipg system following fda approval in the fourth quarter of in  we completed development of accurx  our constant rate implantable drug pump  in part using proprietary technology we licensed from implantable devices limited partnership idp 
we began selling accurx in certain international markets in the second quarter of in january  we strengthened our position in the neuromodulation market by acquiring the assets of idp and esox technology holdings  llc esox 
this acquisition provided us with intellectual property surrounding implantable drug pump technologies in all applications  including pain and cancer therapy 
also in january  we completed the acquisition of hi tronics designs  inc hdi 
we accounted for this acquisition using the pooling of interests method 
acquiring hdi provided us with additional in house expertise in the design and manufacture of highly sophisticated electromechanical devices 
additionally  hdi continues to provide contract development and manufacturing services to third parties  which we report as a separate segment for financial reporting purposes the hdi oem segment 
in the future  we expect our hdi oem segment revenue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenue as we grow revenue from our proprietary neurostimulation systems and drug pumps and increasingly utilize hdi s research and development capabilities for internal product development 
in november  we completed the acquisition of micronet medical  inc micronet  a privately held developer of medical devices based on proprietary micro lead technology 
micronet developed a line of very thin and steerable spinal cord stimulation leads called axxess 
these leads are the smallest neurostimulation leads on the market  which we believe offers advantages in certain applications 
in  we acquired certain operations of our three remaining us distributors who marketed our neuromodulation products in the united states 
in march  we acquired certain operations of sun medical  our largest us distributor 
in september  we acquired certain operations of comedical  our northwestern us distributor and in november  we acquired certain operations of our sole remaining distributor in the northeastern us  state of the art medical products 
as part of these acquisitions  substantially all of the direct sales persons that represented our products joined us as direct employees 
we believe that these acquisitions will strengthen our sales capabilities and allow us to focus the sales priorities of those personnel on our products  expand sales coverage in those former distributor territories and invest in customer and market development 
our current neuromodulation product line includes our genesis ipg system  genesisxp ipg system  renew rf system and accurx constant rate drug pump 
with the launch of our genesis and 
table of contents genesisxp ipg systems  we compete in of the implantable neurostimulation market to treat chronic pain of the trunk and limbs 
the launch of the genesis ipg and genesisxp ipg in slowed our growth rate in sales of renew systems from an average percentage growth rate of the mid teens over the past several years to single digit growth in both and management believes this trend may continue in and has assumed similar single digit growth in renew sales during critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to third party reimbursement rates  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from product sales to end customers  product sales to international distributors  and development contracts 
until we completed the acquisition of certain operations of our remaining us distributors in  we also generated revenue from product sales to us distributors 
we recognize revenue on product sales to end customers and distributors upon shipment  provided an arrangement with the customer or distributor exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of our customers are third party payors who reimburse fixed amounts for services based on a specific diagnosis 
revenue is recognized on these third party payor sales based on the sales price less a contractual adjustment  which is based on our history of reimbursement with the third party payor  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we do not have any continuing obligation to our customers for installation or training  and there are no acceptance clauses in our customer arrangements 
we recognize revenue on development contracts at hdi using either the percentage of completion method for fixed price development contracts  or as the services are performed for development contracts that are completed on a time and materials basis 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method for the fixed price development agreements as the contract term can vary from to months  our right to receive payment depends on our performance in accordance with the agreement  and we can reasonably estimate the costs applicable to various stages of the 
table of contents development arrangement 
revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred in relation to the estimated costs for the total project 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed under a fixed price development agreement  then future profit margins and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
under the company s shipping terms  title transfers to the end customer or distributor at the point of shipment 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition requirements are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
bad debt we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of the receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer  the aging of receivables and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances or write offs may be required 
inventory reserve our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is based upon forecasted demand for our products 
if the demand for our products is less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  patents  purchased technology  trademarks  customer and supplier relations and covenants not to compete  and are amortized using the straight line method over their respective useful lives 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to our products and business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy  in dealing with these matters 
currently  product liability claims and other ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business are the only litigation to which we are a party 
while historically our product liability claims have not resulted in significant monetary liability beyond our insurance coverage  an adverse judgment beyond our insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

to our stock compensation programs 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and results for continue to reflect the positive impact of revenue growth from increased unit sales of our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems  which we launched in the united states in january and december  respectively 
we believe these systems will also generate most of our growth during net revenue 
net revenue increased million  or  in from due to increased sales of our neuromodulation products which increased to a record million in from million in primarily due to increased sales of our genesis family of ipg systems 
revenue from our renew rf system grew modestly year over year 
net revenue of our hdi oem business  as planned  increased modestly to million in from in primarily due to higher volume of oem product sales 
we continue to use more of hdi s manufacturing and development capabilities for our own increasing needs and as such we anticipate only modest growth in our hdi oem business 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  in from due to the increase in net revenue discussed above and an improvement in gross profit margins 
gross profit margins increased to in  compared to in  due to higher sales of our neuromodulation products  which contribute higher margins than hdi oem product sales  higher neuromodulation product sales from direct sales and commissioned agents which contribute higher margins than distributor sales due to three acquisitions in of certain operations of our remaining us distributors  and operational efficiencies gained from higher manufacturing volumes 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million  or  and increased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in  primarily due to increased investments in our sales and marketing capabilities  including the additional sales personnel acquired in the three acquisitions in of certain operations of our remaining us distributors  and to a lesser extent increased investments in research and development and increased amortization expense from intangibles acquired in our various acquisitions 
we continued to leverage our general and administrative expense in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to in from in  and the expense increased in absolute dollars by million principally due to higher commission expense from increased neuro product sales  higher salary expense from annual salary increases and staffing additions in reimbursement  direct sales and clinical support specialists  higher employee benefit costs from staffing additions  higher travel expense due to increased direct sales activities and higher expense for education and training of new implanters of neuro products 
in  we expanded our sales and marketing capabilities with the acquisitions of certain operations from our three remaining us distributors and added substantially all of the salespersons of those businesses to our direct sales force 
we expect to continue to add additional salespersons in the future 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expense  as a percentage of net revenue  increased slightly to in from in  and the expense increased in absolute dollars by million principally due to higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions and annual salary increases  higher stock based compensation expense for certain consultants and higher prototype tooling and test materials for new products under development 
our development efforts in continued to focus on next generation ipg stimulation systems  an ipg stimulation system for deep brain stimulation and next generation drug pumps 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in from in  while the expense increased in absolute dollars by million principally due to higher salary expense from annual salary increases and staffing additions  higher employee benefit costs  higher recruiting fee expense and higher depreciation expense 
amortization of other intangibles 
amortization expense of intangibles increased in from  or  due to a full year of amortization expense for intangible assets we acquired in the november micronet acquisition  plus amortization of additional intangible assets from earn out consideration paid in as milestones were met pursuant to the micronet acquisition agreement 
in addition we recorded amortization expense for intangible assets we acquired in from the acquisition of certain operations of our three remaining us distributors 
we expect amortization expense to increase in by approximately  due to having a full year of amortization expense from the above mentioned acquisitions  excluding additional amortization expense that may be generated as we issue additional earn out consideration that is recorded as intangible assets under the micronet acquisition agreement 
other income 
other income increased million in from primarily due to the reversal of an accrued tax abatement liability of  as we were legally released from our potential obligation to pay that amount in income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million in from as a result of increased income before taxes and an increase in the overall effective tax rate to in from in our increased effective tax rate is primarily due to our federal statutory tax rate being in compared to in the effective tax rates reflect a provision for state taxes  offset by tax exempt interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net income 
net income increased million  or  in from primarily due to the positive impact of revenue growth from increased unit sales of our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems  increased gross margin  and to a lesser extent from the reversal of the tax abatement liability discussed above 
net income per diluted share increased to 
in from 
in excluding the one time tax abatement reversal  net income per share increased to 
in from 
in comparison of the years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased million  or  in from due to increased sales of our neuromodulation products which increased to million in from million in due to the us launch of our genesis ipg system in january and our genesisxp ipg system in december the launch of the genesis ipg in slowed our growth rate in sales of renew systems from an average percentage growth rate in the mid teens over the past several years to single digit growth in net revenue from our hdi oem business increased marginally to million in from million in as we focused more of hdi s resources on our own manufacturing and research and development needs 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  in from due to the increase in net revenue discussed above and an improvement in gross profit margins 
gross profit margins increased to in  compared to in  due to higher sales of our neuromodulation products  which contribute higher margins than hdi oem product sales  higher neuromodulation product sales from direct sales and commissioned agents  which contribute higher margins than distributor sales  and operational efficiencies gained from higher manufacturing volumes 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million in from  but decreased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in due to leveraging of research and development expense  leveraging of general and administrative expense  and to a lesser extent  eliminating amortization expense of goodwill 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense  as a percentage of net revenue  increased to in from in  and the expense increased in absolute dollars by million principally due to higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions in direct sales  reimbursement and sales support positions  higher commission expense from increased product sales  and higher sample and promotional expense in support of the genesis and genesisxp ipg launches 
research and development 
research and development expense  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in from in  while the expense increased in absolute dollars by  principally due to higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions  higher test material expense and higher expense associated with our clinical trials of accurx 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in from in  while the expense increased in absolute dollars by million principally due to higher salary expense from staffing additions including a new executive officer position  higher employee benefit costs  higher bonus expense  higher property tax expense and higher fees for accounting and tax services 
amortization of intangibles 
no amortization expense of goodwill was recorded in due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january  during  we recorded  for amortization expense of goodwill 
amortization expense of other intangibles increased modestly by  in from due to additional amortization expense for intangible assets acquired in november when we completed the acquisition of micronet 
other income 
other income increased to  in from an expense of  in primarily due to a  increase in interest income from higher funds available for investment from our public offering during the second quarter of and the expense in of  for costs associated with the acquisition of hdi 
these costs were expensed instead of capitalized because the acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million in from  but the overall effective tax rate decreased to in compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate in compared to was the result of three factors 
first  our amortization of goodwill in the period was not deductible for tax purposes 
second  the hdi acquisition costs expensed in the period of  were not fully deductible for tax purposes 
finally  the period included tax free interest income 
net income 
net income increased million  or  in from reflecting the positive impact of revenue growth from increased unit sales of our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems  increased gross margin  and leveraging of operating expenses 
net income per diluted share increased 
table of contents to 
in from 
in results for the period reflect amortization expense for goodwill of  the results contain no similar expense since we eliminated the amortization of goodwill on january  when we adopted the new accounting standards for intangible assets described above 
if the amortization expense for goodwill were eliminated from the period  pro forma net income would be million and pro forma net income per diluted share would be 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our working capital increased to million from million at year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  compared to at december  cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  in  we made numerous investments discussed below which were funded to a large extent from operations 
in march  september and november  we acquired certain operations of our three remaining us distributors 
these acquisitions expanded our direct domestic sales force 
the total cost of these acquisitions was approximately million  which we funded from our cash reserves 
in january  we invested million in cash in innovative spinal technologies  inc  a start up company that develops spine technologies  products and services through intellectual property development and contract research 
we increased our investment in inventories to million at december   from million at december  this increase from year end was primarily the result of three factors 
first  we increased our investment in inventories held by direct and commissioned sales agents during as a result of an increased sales force 
second  we increased our investment in raw materials and finished goods for our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems to support our continued success of these products in the us market and in anticipation of continued sales growth 
finally  we increased our overall investment in inventories in anticipation of our move to our new corporate facility in due to the new facility requiring regulatory process validation before product can be manufactured in and shipped from the facility 
our investment in trade accounts receivable increased to million at december   from million at december  due to the increase in sales of our neuromodulation products resulting from the launch of the genesis and genesisxp ipg systems 
our days sales outstanding increased from days at year end to days at year end due to higher receivables due from insurance companies and hospitals as a result of us acquiring all of our us distributors in hospitals and insurance companies have slower payment cycles than our former us distributors  who typically paid us within to days 
in november  we completed the acquisition of micronet 
at closing we paid the former micronet shareholders  in cash and  shares of our common stock with a value at the time of issuance of  in addition  we incurred expenses of  including an investment banking fee of  in march  we paid the former micronet shareholders an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with a value at the time of issuance and release from escrow of  upon the successful completion of half of the first product milestone  and in october  we paid the former micronet shareholders an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with a value at the time of issuance and release from escrow of  upon the successful completion of another product sub milestone 
the former micronet shareholders may receive additional shares of our common stock if additional product and sales milestones are met 
the aggregate value of the additional potential milestone earnout payments was million as measured at the time the transaction was completed 
of this million in additional shares  a fixed number of our common shares totaling  with an aggregate value at closing of million were issued into an 
table of contents escrow account 
shares that are released from escrow if such milestones are met will be valued at the time of release from escrow 
at december    shares remained in escrow 
the product and sales milestones referred to above consist of three principal product milestones and a sales milestone 
each of the product milestones has three to four sub milestones that relate to the delivery of specific products  including four separate electrode leads milestone i  two separate electrode leads milestone ii and three separate leads and a trial cable milestone iii 
the product sub milestones are met if and when we are able to submit  and if and when we receive  regulatory approvals for products that have been adapted for use with our electrical stimulation devices 
the sales milestone will be met if and when we and our subsidiaries generate million in cumulative net sales of micronet lead products during the four years following the closing of the micronet transaction 
an important product milestone deadline occurred under the micronet acquisition agreement in november  which was not met 
we are currently in discussions with the former micronet shareholders regarding this product milestone 
if this product milestone had been achieved by the deadline  the value of the milestone payment at december  was approximately  or  shares  which would have been allocated to certain identifiable intangible assets in accordance with the original purchase price allocation 
excluding expenditures discussed below on our new facility  we spent million during for capital expenditures primarily for new furniture and equipment for personnel we hired during and additional manufacturing tooling and equipment to support our current products and new products we expect to introduce in because we expect our business to continue to grow at rates that will demand added office and facility space  in april we began construction on a new  square foot corporate headquarters facility on the acres of land we acquired in december the land is located in plano  texas  near our current corporate headquarters 
our current lease on our  square foot corporate headquarters expires in august and we plan to relocate to the new facility prior to the expiration of the lease 
we designed the new facility to accommodate planned growth within a five year horizon 
the construction cost of the facility is approximately million  and we expect to spend approximately million on office furniture and equipment for the new facility 
we have funded the interim construction costs from our cash reserves and through december  have spent approximately million 
while we have not yet determined the method by which we will permanently finance the facility  we believe our cash position and overall balance sheet position provides us with various financing alternatives  including financing the facility from our current cash  financing through a debt vehicle such as a mortgage or other form of note  or a sale and leaseback transaction 
we received million of cash during from the exercise of employee  advisory director and director stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
liquidity may also be enhanced based on our ability to utilize all or part of a net operating loss carryforward of million to offset future taxable income 
we acquired million of the net operating loss carryforward in connection with the micronet acquisition and its utilization may be subject to a limitation under section of the internal revenue code 
the rules of section of the internal revenue code generally apply to limit a corporation s ability to utilize acquired net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its federal taxable income in the periods after an acquisition 
the company s ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the micronet acquisition to reduce its federal taxable income is subject to these rules 
provided the company generates sufficient taxable income in future years  the section limitation will have the effect of deferring the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards over several years 
without this limitation  the company would be able to immediately use the net operating loss carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future tax periods 
the total amount of net operating loss carryforwards that 
table of contents the company may use to reduce taxable income in any taxable year after the acquisition is determined with reference to its purchase price of micronet 
based on current estimates and assumptions  we expect to utilize at least approximately  in net operating loss carryforwards per full twelve month tax years  assuming we generate sufficient taxable income in any given year to utilize such amount 
additionally  liquidity may be enhanced to the extent we realize tax benefits from stock option exercises 
exercises of nonqualified stock options  and exercises of incentive stock options followed by disqualifying dispositions of the underlying common stock within one year following exercise generate compensation expense for tax purposes in the year of exercise or disposition  as the case may be 
during  we generated a million tax benefit related to nonqualified stock option exercises and disqualifying dispositions of common stock acquired on exercise of incentive stock options 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our current levels of operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we currently have no credit facilities in place 
if we decide to acquire complementary businesses  product lines or technologies  or enter into joint ventures or strategic alliances that require substantial capital  we intend to finance those activities by the most attractive alternative available  which could include utilizing our current cash  bank borrowings  or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
the following table sets forth certain information concerning our contractual obligations at december  maturity by fiscal year and in thousands total thereafter operating leases inventory purchases commitments for construction of new corporate headquarters facility total in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  these obligations are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations are for operating lease payments primarily related to facilities 
our inventory purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business 
contractual commitments for construction of our new corporate headquarter facility of  square feet 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in from principally due to a million increase in net income and a million increase in tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in from principally due to a million increase in net income 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  our primary investing activities using cash were the purchase of marketable securities million  the purchase of certain operations of three of our us distributors million  funds used to finance the interim construction of our new corporate headquarters facility million  capital expenditures million  and the purchase of minority equity investments in 
table of contents preferred stock of two privately held companies million  while net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities provided cash of million 
in  our primary investing activities using cash were the purchase of marketable securities million  the purchase of land million  capital expenditures million and cash used in the purchase of micronet million  while net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities provided cash of million 
in  our primary investing activities using cash were the purchase of marketable securities million and capital expenditures million for additional manufacturing tooling and equipment  office furniture and equipment  non compete agreements and patents  while maturing certificates of deposit and sales of marketable securities provided cash of million 
the non compete agreements discussed in this section for fiscal year relate to a  expenditure incurred in to purchase a non compete agreement from a former distributor of our neuro products 
in reference to the patents  we incurred  in cash expenditures in addition to the stock we issued with a value of  related to the purchase of esox in january  which was allocated to the patents we acquired in the transaction 
prior to the transaction  we had licensed the technology from esox 
the patents we acquired in the esox transaction relate to our implantable drug pump technologies 
we are currently seeking fda approval to commercialize an implantable drug pump in the united states 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and  in during  all of the cash provided by financing activities was the result of the exercise of stock options 
during  we used  to repay our entire outstanding long term debt  while we received million in net proceeds from a public offering and million from the exercise of stock options 
during  we used  to reduce certain debt obligations  while we received million from the exercise of stock options 
currency fluctuations substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries could reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold  although we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
outlook and uncertainties the following is a safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words expect  estimate  anticipate  predict  believe  plan  will  should  intend  would  scheduled  new market  potential market applications  and similar expressions and variations are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements appear in a number of places in this annual report on form k and include statements regarding our intent  belief or current expectations with respect to  among other things i trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations  ii our financing plans  and iii our business growth strategies 
we caution our readers that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following failure of our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems to gain and maintain market acceptance would adversely affect our revenue growth and profitability 
we formally introduced our genesis ipg system in the us in january and our genesisxp ipg system offering increased battery capacity and longevity in the us in december we believe 
table of contents that the size and potential for growth of the ipg portion of the neurostimulation market are greater than in the rf portion 
accordingly  our ability to generate increased revenue and profitability  and thus our general success  will depend  in large part  on the market s acceptance of our ipg systems 
as a new entrant into the ipg portion of the neurostimulation market  there are many reasons we might not achieve market acceptance on a timely basis  if at all  including the following competing products  technologies and therapies are available  and others may be introduced that gain greater and faster physician and patient acceptance than our ipg systems  and our only competitor in the ipg portion of the market has had its ipg product on the market for some time and enjoys significant brand awareness and other advantages among pain management specialists 
if the ipg portion of the neurostimulation market grows at a faster rate than the rf portion  our failure to successfully market and sell our ipg systems could negatively affect our revenue growth and profitability 
because our main competitor has significantly greater resources than we do and new competitors may enter the neuromodulation market  it may be difficult for us to compete in this market 
the medical device market is highly competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
medtronic  is one of the largest competitors in the medical device sector  and is currently our sole competitor in the neurostimulation market and our largest competitor in the implantable drug pump market 
medtronic is a large publicly traded company and enjoys several competitive advantages over us  including substantially greater name recognition  greater resources for product research and development  sales and marketing  distribution  patent protection and pursuing regulatory approvals  a greater number of established relationships with health care professionals and third party payors  and multiple product lines and the ability to bundle products together or offer discounts  rebates or other incentives to secure a competitive advantage 
medtronic will continue to develop new products that compete directly with our products  and its greater resources may allow it to respond more quickly to new technologies  new treatment indications or changes in customer requirements 
further  we generally price our products at a premium to those of medtronic 
additionally  because the neuromodulation market is a high growth potential market  other companies may attempt to bring new products or therapies into this market 
for example  advanced bionics  inc  a privately held company that currently manufactures and markets a cochlear implant product  has publicly stated that it is developing and may be testing an ipg system for the treatment of chronic pain 
for all of these reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against medtronic or against future competitors 
if pain management specialists do not recommend and endorse our products  our sales could be negatively impacted and we may be unable to increase our revenues and profitability 
our products are based on evolving concepts and techniques in pain management 
acceptance of our products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive features  benefits  clinical 
table of contents efficacy  safety and cost effectiveness of our products compared to alternative therapies and competing products  and on training pain management specialists in the proper use of our products 
to sell our products  we must successfully educate and train pain management specialists so that they will understand our products and feel comfortable recommending and endorsing them 
we may not be able to accomplish this  and even if we are successful in educating and training pain management specialists  there is no guarantee that we will obtain their recommendations and endorsements 
the launch of genesis and genesisxp and other market factors could impede growth in or reduce sales of renew  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our genesis and genesisxp ipg systems are currently the newest neurostimulation products on the market 
although genesis and our renew rf system are targeted towards patients with different types of pain and genesis is not intended to replace renew in the neurostimulation market  some pain management specialists may recommend genesis to their patients when they would have otherwise recommended renew  and  consequently  genesis may cannibalize or substitute for some sales of renew 
further  we believe our principal market competitor has chosen to emphasize the ipg as the therapy of choice in the neurostimulation market 
these factors could lead to a slowdown in growth  or a reduction  in sales of renew and similar rf based neurostimulation products 
although renew and genesis are targeted for different patients  sales growth of renew has slowed since the launch of genesis 
if renew sales growth continues to slow or sales are reduced  and we do not gain enough market share through ipg sales to compensate for these reduced sales  our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
if patients choose less invasive or less expensive alternatives to our products  our sales could be negatively impacted 
we sell medical devices for invasive and minimally invasive surgical procedures 
patient acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors  including device and associated procedure costs  the failure of less invasive therapies to help the patient  the degree of invasiveness involved in the procedures used to implant our products  the rate and severity of complications from the procedures used to implant our products and any adverse side effects caused by the implanting of our products 
if patients choose to use existing less invasive or less expensive alternatives to our products  or if effective new alternatives are developed  our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
any adverse changes in coverage or reimbursement amounts by medicare and medicaid  private insurance companies and managed care organizations  or workers compensation programs could limit our ability to market and sell our products 
in the us  our products are generally covered by medicare and medicaid and other third party payors  such as private insurance companies and managed care organizations  and workers compensation programs  which reimburse patients for all or part of the cost of our products and related medical procedures 
the cost of our products and related procedures are significant  and third party payors carefully scrutinize whether to cover new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
further  for certain types of procedures  gaps exist between the rate of reimbursement paid by medicare and medicaid and the rates paid by private insurers 
in addition  gaps exist in reimbursement levels depending on the health care setting in which physicians perform procedures using our products 
in the future  these gaps may narrow and public and private payors may reduce levels of reimbursement for neuromodulation devices in an effort to control increasing costs 
if medicare or other third party payors decide to eliminate or reduce coverage amounts on patient reimbursements for our products  this could limit our ability to market and sell our products in the us  which would materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
in november  for example  the center for medicare and medicaid services issued a final ruling establishing new 
table of contents reimbursement rates for medicare hospital outpatient procedures  including spinal cord stimulation procedures 
reimbursement levels for permanent implants of spinal cord stimulation devices in the hospital outpatient setting were generally reduced as a result of the ruling  which decreased the amount that hospitals would be reimbursed by medicare for these procedures 
however  because the new rates continue to provide hospitals with adequate margins to cover their facility costs and yield a fair profit to the hospitals  the new rates have not had an adverse effect on the prices we charge hospitals for our systems 
if in the future cms reduces rates to such an extent that hospitals ability to continue operating profitably in these procedures were at risk  then there could be price pressure on our products at that time 
international market acceptance of our products may also depend  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
we may not obtain international reimbursement approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
where reimbursement in foreign markets is available  it tends to be at levels significantly below those in the us our failure to receive international reimbursement approvals may negatively impact market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which those approvals are sought 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may take advantage of our ideas and compete directly against us 
we rely in part on patents  trade secrets and proprietary technology to remain competitive 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate us patent protection for new products or ideas  or prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by employees 
additionally  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation may be necessary to enforce them  which could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion of the attention of our management and key technical employees 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitors could use our intellectual property to develop new products or enhance their existing products 
this could harm our competitive position  decrease our market share or otherwise harm our business 
us patent no 
 covers a non invasive multiprogrammable tissue stimulator and method wherein only the programming data need be transmitted 
the programming data may define the stimulator s electrode selection  electrode polarity as either positive  negative or high impedence state  and simulation pulse parameter 
this patent is scheduled to expire on december  the expiration of this patent may allow competitors to offer programmable stimulators that define electrode selection  polarity and stimulation pulse parameters  and thus could have an adverse effect on our business 
a request for an extension of the term of this patent has been filed with the united states patent office pursuant to a federal statute that permits us to seek such an extension based on a regulatory approval delay 
a final ruling on the extension request has not been made at the present time 
while five other us patents owned or licensed by us are due to expire prior to  the expiration of these other patents would not have a material effect on our ability to protect the intellectual property rights currently utilized in our business  because the patents cover technologies that are not currently utilized in our existing products or services 
other parties may sue us for infringing their intellectual property rights  or we may have to sue them to protect our intellectual property rights 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the medical technology industry regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
the neuromodulation market is characterized by extensive patent and other intellectual property rights  which can create greater potential than in less developed markets for 
table of contents possible allegations of infringement  particularly with respect to newly developed technology 
we may be forced to defend ourselves against allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  we may find it necessary  if threatened  to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court that we are not infringing the intellectual property rights of others or that these rights are invalid or unenforceable  or to protect our own intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and complex and its outcome is difficult to predict 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we would be required to stop the infringing activity  obtain a license  or concede intellectual property rights 
any required license may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and  therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
failure to obtain necessary government approvals for new products or for new applications for existing products would mean we could not sell those new products  or sell our existing products for those new applications 
our products are medical devices  which are subject to extensive government regulation in the us and in foreign countries where we do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the us must first receive either a pma or a k clearance from the fda with respect to each application for which we intend to market it 
either process can be lengthy and expensive 
according to the fda  the average k review period was days in  but reviews may take longer and approvals may be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop 
the pma process is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
according to the fda  the average pma submission to decision period was days in  however  reviews may take much longer and completing a pma application can require numerous clinical trials and require the filing of amendments over time 
the result of these lengthy approval processes is that a new product  or a new application for an existing product  often cannot be brought to market for a number of years after it is developed 
additionally  we anticipate that many of the products we bring to market in the future will require us to seek pma approvals rather than k clearances 
if we fail to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals of our new products or new applications for existing products on a timely and cost effective basis  we will be unable to market the affected products for their intended applications 
modification of any marketed device could require a new k clearance or pma or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
any modification we want to make to an fda cleared or approved device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  would require a new k clearance  or possibly a new or supplemental pma 
under fda procedures  we would make the initial determination of whether to seek a new k clearance or pma  but the fda could review our decision 
if the fda disagrees with our decision not to seek a new k clearance or pma and requires us to seek either k clearance or pma for modifications we have already made to a previously cleared product  we might be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
we could also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
we will be unable to sell our products if we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations 
to commercially manufacture our products  we must comply with government manufacturing regulations that govern design controls  quality systems and documentation policies and procedures 
the fda and equivalent foreign governmental authorities periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities 
our failure to comply with these manufacturing regulations may prevent or delay our marketing or distribution of our products  which would negatively impact our business 

table of contents our products are subject to product recalls even after receiving fda clearance or approval  which would negatively affect our financial performance and could harm our reputation 
any of our products may be found to have significant deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of any such defective product 
a government mandated or voluntary recall could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects 
we do not maintain insurance to cover losses incurred as a result of product recalls 
any product recall would divert managerial and financial resources and negatively affect our financial performance  and could harm our reputation with customers 
we are subject to potential product liability and other claims and we may not have the insurance or other resources to cover the cost of any successful claim 
defects in our implantable medical devices could subject us to potential product liability claims that our devices were ineffective or caused some harm to the human body 
our current product liability litigation involves assertions that our products did not perform as intended and  in some cases  that they caused discomfort or harm to the patient 
our product liability insurance may not be adequate to cover current or future claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and  in the future  may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us  if it is available to us at all 
plaintiffs may also advance other legal theories supporting their claims that our products or actions resulted in some harm 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and financial condition 
we are subject to substantial government regulation and our failure to comply with all applicable government regulations could subject us to numerous penalties  any of which could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to numerous government regulations relating to  among other things  our ability to sell our products  third party reimbursement  fraud and abuse of medicare or medicaid and patient privacy 
if we do not comply with all applicable government regulations  government authorities could do any of the following impose fines and penalties on us  prevent us from manufacturing our products  bring civil or criminal charges against us  delay the introduction of our new products into the market  recall or seize our products  disrupt the manufacture or distribution of our products  or withdraw or deny approvals for our products 
any one of these results could materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability and harm our reputation 

table of contents our reliance on single suppliers for critical components used in our main products could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on time 
we continue to rely upon sole source suppliers for certain materials and services used in manufacturing our products  including the custom chip used in the receiver of our rf system  the computer chip used in the ipg programmer and renew transmitter  the batteries used in our ipg system and the medical grade polyurethane bionate that we use in all of our products  for reasons of quality assurance  component availability or cost effectiveness 
we work closely with our vendors to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability 
with the exception of the custom chip used in our rf receiver  which we discuss below  we believe that alternative suppliers exist for the other components used to manufacture our products 
fda requirements regarding the design and manufacture of our products require an investment in time and money to establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials 
we believe that in some cases  the cost of pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of our products would significantly outweigh the benefits of doing so and consume significant resources that are better devoted to other aspects of our business 
similarly  qualifying alternative sources or product designs require costly and time consuming regulatory submissions and approvals that again may not be justified from a cost benefit standpoint for all components used in our products 
the reduction or interruption in supply  or our inability to develop alternative sources of supply  could adversely affect our operations 
although there are currently no alternative suppliers for the custom chip used in our rf system  we have sufficient chips in stock to meet our near term requirements and we believe we will be able to order more chips to meet our future needs 
in the meantime  we are designing and developing our own replacement chip 
the sole supplier of this chip first indicated its desire to cease manufacturing and supplying the rf system chip several years ago 
the supplier has continued to supply the chip  however  and to date has not determined if and when it will cease to supply the chip 
the supplier has agreed to notify us when it does decide to cease supplying the chip and has promised to permit us to place a final one time purchase order for the chip 
in the interim  we have maintained and will continue to maintain a higher than normal inventory of the chip 
we currently have enough of the chips in stock to meet our requirements through the end of our engineers are developing a new chip to be used with our next generation rf receiver 
our engineers estimate that this new chip and the next generation rf receiver would be completed and have received the appropriate regulatory approvals by the second half of consequently  under the circumstances  we do not believe that a single source of supply for the rf system chip poses a serious risk to our business 
our rf system sales accounted for approximately of our total neuro product segment sales in  and approximately of our total sales 
our major competitor in the neuromodulation market currently accounts for a significant percentage of our revenue from our hdi oem segment 
during  we had two major customers that together accounted for million  or  of our net revenue from our hdi oem segment 
medtronic  our most significant competitor  accounted for million  or and arrow accounted for million  or 
either of these customers could cease doing business with us at any time 
if this were to occur  our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected  at least in the short term 
we are dependent upon the success of neuromodulation technology 
our inability to continue to develop innovative neuromodulation products  or the failure of the neuromodulation market to develop as we anticipate  would adversely affect our business 
our current products focus on the treatment of chronic pain using neuromodulation 
our development efforts focus on leveraging our neuromodulation expertise 
the neuromodulation market is subject to 
table of contents rapid technological change and product innovation 
our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing products  using neuromodulation technology or other technologies that may be superior to ours 
if we are unable to compete successfully in the development of new neuromodulation products  or if new and effective therapies not based on neuromodulation are developed  our products could be rendered obsolete or non competitive 
this would materially adversely affect our business 
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel and scientific staff 
we believe our future success will depend on our ability to manage our growth successfully  including attracting and retaining scientists  engineers and other highly skilled personnel 
our key employees are subject to confidentiality  trade secret and non competition agreements  but may terminate their employment with us at any time 
hiring qualified management and technical personnel is difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
competition for these types of employees is intense in the medical device field 
if we fail to attract and retain personnel  particularly management and technical personnel  we may not be able to continue to succeed in the neuromodulation market 
if we choose to acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves  we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or to successfully integrate an acquired business  product or technology in a cost effective and non disruptive manner 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
accordingly  we may  as we have in the past  acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves 
we do not know if we will be able to identify prospective acquisition targets or complete any future acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably or retain its key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management and key technical personnel 
if we are unable to integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies effectively  our business will suffer 
in addition  any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our business and operating results 
we are subject to additional risks associated with international operations 
internationally  we market our products through independent distributors who represent us in countries  except in germany where we are represented by direct salespersons 
in  of our sales revenue from our neuromodulation products segment came from international sales 
international sales are subject to a number of additional risks  including the following establishment by foreign regulatory agencies of requirements different from those in place in the us  fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar against foreign currencies that may affect demand for our products overseas  export license requirements  changes in tariffs  and other general trade restrictions  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  political or economic instability  and lower and more restrictive third party reimbursement for our products 

table of contents any of these risks could make it difficult or impossible for us to continue to expand our overseas operations  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
our operations are conducted at three locations  and a disaster at any of these facilities could result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
we currently conduct all of our development  manufacturing and management activities at our facilities in plano  texas and budd lake and hackettstown  new jersey 
however  a natural disaster  such as a tornado  fire or flood  or a man made disaster  could cause substantial delays in our operations  damage or destroy our manufacturing equipment or inventory and cause us to incur significant additional expenses 
a disaster could seriously harm our business and affect our reputation with customers 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
we may be obligated to issue shares of our common stock in the future and the number of shares could increase if our stock price decreases 
in connection with the acquisition of micronet in november  as part of the purchase price  we agreed to pay the former micronet shareholders additional shares of our common stock if certain product  regulatory approval and sales milestones are met 
the aggregate value of the additional potential milestone earnout payments payable in shares of our common stock was million as measured at the time the transaction was completed 
of this million in additional shares  we issued a fixed number of shares totaling  with an aggregate value at closing of million into an escrow account 
if and when specified product and regulatory milestones are achieved  we will release a specified and fixed number of shares of common stock from escrow to the former micronet shareholders 
in addition  if and when those same product and regulatory milestones are achieved  we will also issue at that time a number of shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of up to million 
finally  if and when we generate million in cumulative net sales of micronet lead products during the four years following the closing  we will issue at that time a number of shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
thus  we agreed to issue shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of up to million in the future upon the achievement of specific milestones  the number of shares of which will depend on the average trading price of our common stock 
the average trading price for this purpose is the per share average closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market for the consecutive trading days immediately prior to two business days before the applicable milestone payment date 
because the number of shares we could be required to issue depends on the average trading price at the time of payment  if the average trading price of our common stock declines significantly  we could be required to issue more shares of our common stock 
for example  if our stock price were per share and we were required to issue million of our common stock on satisfaction of the sales milestone  we would be required to issue  shares of our common stock to the former micronet shareholders 
if our stock price declined from that level to per share  however  we would be required to issue twice as many shares  or  shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash reserves in high quality short term liquid money market instruments with major financial institutions  a high quality short term municipal bond fund with a major financial institution and certificates of deposit 
at december   we had  invested in money market funds   in certificates of deposit with maturities less than days from the purchase date and  in a tax free municipal bond fund with daily liquidity 
the rate of interest earned on these investments will vary with overall market rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rates earned on these investments would not have a material effect on our income or cash flows 

table of contents we also have certain investments in available for sale securities 
these investments primarily consist of investment grade municipal bonds with maturities less than one year from the date of purchase  day and day aaa municipal bond floaters and freddie mac notes with maturities less than one year from the date of purchase 
the cost of these investments is  and the fair value at december  was  the investments are subject to overall bond market and interest rate risk  however the company believes the risk to be limited since a large portion of the investments   are in day and day municipal floaters which have no principal risk 
the investment grade municipal bonds and freddie mac notes may have risk of principal depending on the overall bond market 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of these investments from their prices at december  would decrease the fair value by  we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our investments or debt instruments 
at december   we had no interest bearing debt
