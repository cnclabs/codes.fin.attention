overview we are an independent software company providing software that empowers designers  developers and business users to create and deliver effective user experiences on the internet  fixed media and wireless and digital devices 
our integrated family of technologies enables the development of a wide range of internet solutions including websites  rich media content and internet applications across multiple platforms and devices 
strategy macromedia has been recognized as a leader in multimedia and web development technologies for over a decade 
through our mx family of products  including dreamweaver  flash  fireworks  coldfusion and the studio suite  we have enabled millions of professional designers and developers to create rich  engaging  interactive web content and applications 
our growth strategy is to leverage the assets we have built in that core business principally our technology  our brands and our worldwide distribution engine to grow into even larger markets serving non technical professionals 
in fiscal year  we began to see a return on our investment in these new markets  with the introduction of new products for two distinct markets business users  who are non technical knowledge workers  trainers or business decisions makers who want to communicate and collaborate via the internet  and consumers  who increasingly expect a rich user experience on digital devices such as personal digital assistants pdas and cellular phones 
our strategy to reach the business user is to provide complete solutions like breeze and contribute that leverage the power of our technology platform in an integrated delivery platform 
to reach the consumer  we are licensing our flash player technology to leading telecommunications service providers and consumer electronics companies that are embedding it in their devices to enable multimedia functionality 
we believe that these two new markets offer the potential for significant 
table of contents growth for the company over the next decade 
our primary products and the markets that they serve are broken down as follows designer and developer business user consumer macromedia studio mx macromedia contribute macromedia flash player macromedia dreamweaver mx macromedia breeze macromedia shockwave player macromedia flash mx macromedia robodemo macromedia flash lite macromedia fireworks mx macromedia freehand mx macromedia director mx macromedia robohelp macromedia roboinfo macromedia authorware macromedia coldfusion mx macromedia jrun macromedia flex industry and economic overview during fiscal year  we observed some strengthening in the demand for software products  with increases in several key indicators of demand such as broadband penetration  on line advertising spending and broad indicators of it spending 
while the business environment showed some improvement as compared to prior years  customer budgets remained tight and we note that corporations  government agencies  educational institutions and independent developers worldwide are increasingly focused on the return on investment they can generate from their spending 
accordingly  we have maintained our focus on controlling costs  while continuing to invest in the research and development activities required to drive innovation and growth 
product update in fiscal year  we launched a significant number of new products and new versions of existing products  including new versions of our mx family of products macromedia dreamweaver mx  macromedia flash mx  macromedia coldfusion mx  macromedia fireworks mx  macromedia freehand mx  macromedia director mx and macromedia studio mx in addition  we added macromedia robodemo  macromedia roboinfo  and macromedia robohelp x to our product portfolio through the acquisition of ehelp corporation ehelp in december we also launched macromedia flex  our newest server product  in march to provide a solution for enterprise programmers who build and deploy rich internet applications rias 
financial highlights for fiscal year our net revenues for fiscal year were million  a increase from net revenues of million in fiscal year this increase primarily reflects the growth in our business user and consumer markets  the favorable impact of strengthening foreign currencies  and to a lesser degree  the impact of our acquisition of ehelp and the resulting addition of new products to our portfolio 
offsetting this increase  we experienced lower than expected initial sales of our mx products following the mx launch in the second quarter of fiscal year our net income was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year operationally  we reduced our cost of net revenues from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  reflecting a greater percentage of net revenues from volume and original equipment manufacture oem license sales  which typically have lower material and distribution costs than our traditional boxed product sales 
offsetting this reduction in costs  our sales and marketing 
table of contents expenditures increased to support the launch of our mx products to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to acquired developed technology and a million charge for the write off of certain intangible assets related to trade names which contributed to the increase in net income in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal year was million 
during the year  our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances increased by million from million at march  to million at march  significant non operating uses of cash in fiscal year included the purchase of property and equipment of million  including the purchase of land and buildings and million for the net purchase of available for sale securities 
cash provided by the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options was million 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we completed our acquisition of ehelp  a provider of rich media help authoring software applications 
the purchase price of ehelp was million and was comprised of the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock valued at million  million in cash  and the assumption of converted options to purchase million shares of our common stock and transaction costs 
throughout fiscal years  and  we operated in one business segment  the software segment 
results of operations net revenues change vs 
vs 
in millions  except percentages net revenues net revenues are comprised primarily of license fees  as well as revenues from maintenance  training  technical and other support services 
maintenance  training and other support services comprised less than of our net revenues in fiscal years  and fluctuations in net revenues can be attributed to changes in product and customer mix  general trends in it spending  as well as to geographic fluctuations and corresponding changes in foreign exchange rates 
further  product life cycles impact revenues period to period as new products and versions are released 
net revenues by market change vs vs in millions  except percentages designer and developer business user n m consumer other net revenues fiscal year versus fiscal year net revenues increased from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in our net revenues in the current fiscal year reflects revenue growth from our product offerings marketed to consumers and business 
table of contents users  the favorable impact of strengthening foreign currencies as more fully described below under net revenues by geography  and to a lesser degree  the incremental product revenues resulting from our acquisition of ehelp  partially offset by lower than expected sales of our mx products following their initial release in the second quarter of fiscal year net revenues from our products marketed to our business users  including breeze and contribute  which were introduced during the last half of fiscal year  comprised of net revenues for fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year net revenues from products marketed to consumers consist primarily of royalties earned from oems for the license of our flash technology for use on various mobile devices and platforms and comprised of net revenues in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the revenue growth in our designer and developer products reflects the favorable impact of strengthening foreign currencies  growth in educational sales and net revenues from our learning and help products resulting from the acquisition of ehelp 
we have a history of introducing new or enhanced product offerings that impact our reported net revenues 
for example  we released english language versions of our primary mx products in the second quarter of fiscal year and foreign language versions of these products in the third quarter of fiscal year the initial demand for these products was below anticipated amounts based on historical analysis of revenue performance following the release of earlier product versions 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we experienced revenue growth resulting from new versions of robohelp x and roboinfo delays in the introduction of planned future product releases  or failure to achieve significant customer acceptance for these new products  may have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and consolidated results of operations in future periods 
fiscal year versus fiscal year net revenues increased from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the successful launch of our new products and new versions of existing products 
however  we also believe our net revenues in fiscal year were adversely impacted by the weakness in it and web developer spending 
net revenues from our designer and developer market grew from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year due primarily to the introduction of our mx product family 
macromedia studio mx  which was launched in the first quarter of fiscal year  represented approximately of our net revenues in fiscal year although sales of macromedia studio mx resulted in a decrease in sales of our stand alone products that are included in our studio mx bundle  aggregate sales from all of our mx products increased by in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was partially offset by a decline in net revenues from server products  primarily macromedia coldfusion mx 
revenues from our server products decreased to million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to continued pricing pressures resulting from a very competitive market environment  partially offset by releases of new versions of existing products in fiscal year net revenues by geography change vs

the strengthening of international currencies relative to the us dollar in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year had a favorable impact on operating income of approximately million 
had exchange rates in fiscal year been in effect during fiscal year  translated international net revenues billed in local currencies would have been million lower and operating expenses would have been million lower 
changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant impact on net revenues and operating expenses in future periods 
to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency net revenues and expenses  primarily denominated in the euro  japanese yen and british pound  we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to provide greater predictability of the affect of currency fluctuations on net revenue and operating expenses of certain forecasted transactions over our fiscal year 
see risk factors that may affect future results of operations risks associated with our international operations for additional information 
fiscal year versus fiscal year north american net revenues in fiscal year remained flat with fiscal year increases in net revenues related to the launch of our new products and new versions of our existing products in north america were offset by continued weakness in it and web developer spending 
the increase in international net revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily resulted from our increased sales efforts in new international markets and from the launch of new products and new versions of existing products  partially offset by the weakness in certain foreign economic environments in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the strengthening of international currencies relative to the us dollar in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year also had a favorable impact on operating income and revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the fluctuation in foreign currencies resulted in a favorable million impact on operating income

table of contents cost of net revenues includes cost of materials  royalties paid to third parties for the licensing of developed technology  product assembly and distribution costs  costs incurred in providing training and technical support to customers and business partners and costs to translate our software into various foreign languages 
fiscal year versus fiscal year cost of net revenues decreased to million and represented of net revenues in fiscal year from million or of net revenues in fiscal year the decrease in cost of net revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year reflects a greater percentage of net revenues from volume and oem license sales  which typically have lower material and distribution costs than our traditional boxed product sales 
this decrease also resulted from lower inventory charges for obsolescence in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the beneficial impact of our volume and oem license sales and lower inventory charges for obsolescence were partially offset by additional costs incurred to outsource portions of our e commerce operations to a third party 
amortization of acquired developed technology from acquisitions decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was mainly due to the impairment of acquired technology from our allaire acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal year  partially offset by the amortization of acquired technology from our ehelp acquisition incurred in the third quarter of fiscal year following our acquisition of ehelp  amortization of acquired developed technology increased as we amortize acquired developed technology recorded as a result of our purchase over an estimated useful life of four years 
at march   the remaining acquired developed technology balance is million  which will be amortized through fiscal year in the future  cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues may be impacted by the mix of product sales  royalty rates for licensed technology and the geographic distribution of sales 
fiscal year versus fiscal year cost of net revenues was million or of net revenues in fiscal year  as compared to million or of net revenues in fiscal year cost of net revenues decreased as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to decreases in cost of materials  training costs and royalties paid to third parties for the licensing of developed technology 
in addition  during fiscal year  we had a greater percentage of net revenues from volume license sales  which have a higher gross margin than our traditional box product sales 
these savings were partially offset by an increase in inventory charges for obsolescence of million in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the launch of the mx product family 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we performed an impairment analysis on the acquired developed technology asset associated with our acquisition of allaire corporation allaire in fiscal year under sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million  which represented the amount by which the carrying value of the acquired developed technology asset exceeded its net realizable value 
amortization of acquired developed technology decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was mainly due to the impairment of acquired technology from our allaire acquisition recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the following compensation and benefits  marketing and advertising expenses  activities which support product launches and direct sales efforts  including travel  and allocated expenses for our facilities and it infrastructure to support marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase primarily resulted from an increase in compensation related expense resulting from an increase in headcount  higher net revenues and increases in product marketing and advertising activities 
compensation related expenses increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulting from an increase in headcount and higher commissions related to increased net revenues and the costs associated with our acquisition of ehelp in december product marketing and advertising expenditures increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year reflecting higher expenditures related to the launch of macromedia studio mx as compared to marketing expenditures related to the launch of macromedia mx in the prior fiscal year and expenditures related to the launch of robohelp x and roboinfo in addition  travel and other expenses related to higher sales volume and product launch related activities increased by million in fiscal year from fiscal year sales and marketing expenses decreased million to million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to reductions in allocated facility and it expenses of million resulting from our fiscal year restructuring and lower compensation expenses of million 
we expect to continue investing in sales and marketing of our products as we continue to launch and sell new products  develop market opportunities and promote our competitive position 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to constitute a significant portion of our overall spending 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits as well as allocated expenses for our facilities and it infrastructure to support product development 

table of contents research and development expenses decreased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease primarily resulted from a reduction in depreciation expense and facilities charges of million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in addition  compensation charges decreased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year due to lower average headcount in the current period 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in contract personnel and temporary labor spending of million primarily related to the introduction of the mx products in the second quarter of fiscal year research and development expenses decreased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in allocated facility and it expenses of million resulting from our fiscal year restructuring and lower compensation expenses of million 
during fiscal year  we released version upgrades to our mx family of products as well as introduced macromedia flex in march we anticipate continuing to invest significant resources into research and development activities in order to develop new products  enhance the technology in our existing products and to develop new technologies 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  fees for professional services and allocated expenses for our facilities and it infrastructure to support general and administrative activities 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year compensation related expenses increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulting from an increase in headcount  primarily in compliance functions 
other employee costs  which include temporary staffing  training  recruiting and relocation costs  also increased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as a result of supporting increased staffing needs 
partially offsetting these increases  professional legal fees decreased by million from fiscal year to fiscal year following the settlement of certain legal matters see litigation settlements 
general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to decreases in allocated facility and it expenses of million resulting from our fiscal year restructuring and a million decrease in professional fees primarily related to various legal matters settled in fiscal year we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in the near future will continue to include costs to comply with newly proposed and enacted rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and the nasdaq stock market  including costs to hire additional personnel and use additional accounting and advisory services 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
we amortize intangible assets with estimated useful lives 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was mainly due to the impairment of certain intangible assets recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year as more fully described below  partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of our ehelp acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal year amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was mainly due to our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on april  following which goodwill is no longer amortized 
following the results obtained from our impairment analysis of our acquired developed technology asset in the second quarter of fiscal year see discussion in cost of revenues  we performed an impairment analysis on the trade name associated with our fiscal year acquisition of allaire 
we performed our analysis 
table of contents under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  initially comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the trade name to its carrying value 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the trade name asset in fiscal year this charge represented the amount by which the carrying value of the trade name asset exceeded its fair value  estimated by calculating its discounted cash flows 
in process research and development 
in fiscal year  we recorded million of in process research and development attributable to certain technologies in connection with our acquisition of ehelp 
the acquired technology was recognized as in process research and development as the technology had not reached technological feasibility at the time ehelp was acquired and had no alternative future use 
in fiscal year  we recorded  of in process research and development attributable to certain technologies recorded in connection with our fiscal year acquisitions 
such technologies were recognized as in process research and development as they had not reached technological feasibility at the time they were acquired and had no alternative future uses 
restructuring expenses 
in fiscal year  we executed a restructuring plan to deliver cost synergies associated with our fiscal year acquisition of allaire and to better align our cost structure with the weaker business environment 
the million charge recorded as a result of the restructuring primarily related to exit costs to cancel or vacate approximately  square feet of facility space held under our operating leases and to employee termination and severance costs 
our restructuring expenses and accruals involved significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time that the estimates were made  some of which we have obtained and verified through third party advisors 
we continually review our restructuring accrual to determine its appropriateness and reasonableness 
no significant changes have been made to these estimates in fiscal years or other income expense in millions interest income  net gain loss on investments and other  net loss on equity affiliate litigation settlements other  net total other income expense  net interest income 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on interest bearing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale short term investments 
interest income was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decline in our interest income in fiscal year and in fiscal year is primarily due to lower yields on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as compared to the respective prior fiscal years  partially offset by higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
gain loss on investments and other  net 
gain loss on investments and other  net includes the gains and losses on the sale or other than temporary declines in the value of our available for sale investments in the common stock of public companies and on our investments in the common stock of privately held companies 

table of contents gain loss on investments and other  net was million in fiscal years and and million in fiscal year historically  we held common stock in public companies that were accounted for as available for sale investments 
it is our policy to record impairment losses on investments in publicly traded equity securities when it is determined that there has been a decline in the fair market value of the investment that is other than temporary 
we have recorded realized gains and losses upon the subsequent sales of these publicly traded equity securities determined as the difference between the sales price and the carrying value in fiscal years and at march   we no longer held any available for sale investments in the common stock of public companies 
we have also historically held investments in the common and preferred stock of certain privately held companies that are accounted for under the cost method  reviewing such investments for factors which indicate that declines in value may be other than temporary and recording impairment charges when declines in value are deemed to be other than temporary 
these factors include evaluating  as available  the cash flows and profitability of the investee  general economic conditions  trends in the investee s industry and trends in publicly traded peers of the investee 
we have recorded realized gains and losses from privately held equity securities in fiscal years and at the time the investments were sold when such investments were sold at a value exceeding the carrying value and or upon the receipt of cash proceeds from distributions made by the entity 
at march   we held equity interests in several privately held companies for which no carrying value was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in fiscal year  we also recorded a gain on the sale of acquired technology of million 
the net carrying value of the technology  which was previously acquired in connection with an acquisition during fiscal year  had already been fully amortized on its consolidated balance sheet as of the date of sale 
this gain represented the net amount of the proceeds 
in fiscal year  we recorded impairment losses on strategic investments of million 
these losses represented write offs or write downs of the carrying amount of these investments and were determined after considering  among other factors  the investees current and projected operating results  including estimated liquidation value and the inability of the investees to obtain additional financing 
during fiscal year  we received cash proceeds totaling million  representing our portion of the liquidated assets of two investees whose investment balances were previously written off during fiscal year in accordance with our accounting policy 
loss on equity affiliate

our investment balance in atomshockwave since september  has been zero 
accordingly  we have not recognized our share of atomshockwave s profits or losses since september   although we held approximately of the outstanding voting shares of atomshockwave at march  while we have ongoing agreements with atomshockwave relating to distribution of the macromedia shockwave player and use of the shockwave trademark  we have no obligation to fund or otherwise support the activities of atomshockwave

other  net  was a million loss in fiscal year  as compared to a million loss in fiscal year we recorded a million loss in other  net in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year the increase in the loss of other  net  is primarily due to the impact of foreign currency remeasurement losses  principally related to those currencies that are not hedged and fees related to increased banking services 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
current taxes are primarily due the affect of net operating loss carryforwards associated with purchase business combinations which are recorded as a reduction to our goodwill balance instead of our provision for income taxes  and taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate 
deferred taxes are primarily due to a change in deferred tax assets  which are related to domestic temporary differences 
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance has been established and is determined by assessing whether it is more likely than not the company will realize the tax benefits of its deferred tax assets in the future 
at march   we had available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
we also had unused research credit carryforwards of million and million for federal and california tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  federal and state net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards will expire in fiscal year through the california research credits may be carried forward indefinitely

cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plans 
our liquidity and capital resources in any period could be impacted by the exercise of outstanding common stock options and cash proceeds upon exercise of these securities and securities reserved for future issuance under our stock option plans 
in fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of million  including the purchase of land and buildings more fully described above 
in fiscal year  we anticipate spending between million to million on capital expenditures  primarily relating to the purchase and build on of a building property more fully described below see purchase commitments for which we used available cash of million in april we expect that for the foreseeable future  our operating expenses and investing activities as they relate to the associated costs of furnishing and improving our newly purchased office buildings will constitute a significant use of our cash balances  but that our cash from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale short term investments will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through at least the next twelve months 
at times  we may require additional liquid capital resources and may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
if additional funds are required at a future date and are not available on acceptable terms  our business and operating results could be adversely affected

for certain of these operating leases  we have entered into agreements to indemnify lessors against certain additional costs through the term of the respective leases 
to date  we have not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in our consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees 
obligations included in restructuring accrual we lease office space under operating leases that have been recognized in our restructuring liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we sublease a portion of this restructured space 
as a result  the restructuring liability on our consolidated balance sheets reflects our obligation net of contractual and estimated sublease income 
obligations included in restructuring accrual in the above table reflect our lease obligations gross of contractual and estimated sublease income 
property purchase obligations in august  we exercised our option to purchase certain real property  including land  buildings and related improvements  in san francisco  california  for a total purchase price of million 
the new facilities  which are in immediate proximity to our current headquarters  consist of a parking structure and two office buildings 
we have fully paid two of these properties and title to these properties was transferred to us as of march  for the third property  we deposited million into escrow in august and paid the remaining million of the purchase price upon closing of the purchase and upon transfer of title on april  we are currently utilizing the parking structure 
we will begin building out the third facility at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year and the remaining facility based on future headcount and operational needs  which we anticipate occur subsequent to fiscal year other purchase obligations other significant purchase obligations represent minimum non cancelable financial commitments made for which the respective goods or services have not been received as of march  the majority of our other purchase obligations relate to commitments related to information technology and telecommunication services 

table of contents other commitments letters of credit we obtained letters of credit from financial institutions totaling million as of march   in lieu of security deposits for leased office space 
no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit 
intellectual property indemnification obligations the terms of our distribution agreements with our first tier distributors  including oems  and our license agreements with our direct customers  generally provide for a limited indemnification of such distributors and customers against losses  expenses and liabilities arising from third party claims based on alleged infringement by our products of an intellectual property right of such third party 
the terms of such indemnification often limit the scope of  and remedies for  such indemnification obligations and generally include a right to replace an infringing product 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our distributors or customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions pertaining to third party intellectual property infringement claims 
for several reasons  including the lack of prior indemnification claims and the lack of a monetary liability limit for certain infringement cases under the terms of the corresponding agreements with our distributors and customers  we cannot determine the maximum amount of potential future payments  if any  related to such indemnification provisions 
other contingent liabilities and commitments in the normal course of our business  we have also entered into other indemnification agreements or guarantees that arise in various types of arrangements  including those with financial institutions under banking arrangements 
to date  we have not made any significant payments under such indemnification agreements or guarantees and no amount has been accrued on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to those indemnification agreements or guarantees 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or with related parties  nor do we use other forms to off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
as of march   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies we make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements including the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as well as the amounts of net revenues  operating income and net income on our consolidated statements of operations 
we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies to macromedia allowance for sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  restructuring expenses and related accruals  and income taxes 
allowance for sales returns 
the primary sales channels through which we sell our boxed and volume license products throughout the world are a network of distributors and product resellers  commonly referred to as value added resellers vars 
agreements for boxed products with our distributors and vars contain specific product return privileges for stock rotation and obsolete products that are generally limited to contractual amounts 
product returns are recorded as a reduction of net revenues 
current product returns for stock rotation from distributors are generally limited to of their prior quarter s purchases  provided they order new products for an amount equal to or exceeding the amount of the requested return 
distributors may  and typically do  return of their inventory balance of obsolete products within a limited time after the release of a new version of that software product 
under the terms of our distribution agreements  authorized returns of obsolete products require a new order from such distributor at an amount not less than the amount of the requested return 
sales of our volume licensed products generally do not contain return privileges 
products purchased directly from us by end users  including sales from our online stores  have day return rights 
as part of our revenue recognition practices  we have established an allowance for sales returns based upon estimated and known returns 

table of contents we review our allowance for sales returns on an ongoing basis 
at march   our sales returns reserve totaled million and included million of requested and authorized returns by our distributors primarily related to our studio mx product upgrade during fiscal year in estimating our allowance for sales returns  we evaluate the following factors historical product returns and inventory levels on a product by product basis for each of our primary sales regions  current inventory levels and sell through data on a product by product basis as reported to us by our distributors worldwide on a weekly or monthly basis  our demand forecast by product in each of our principal geographic markets  which is impacted by our product release schedule  seasonal trends  analyses developed by our internal sales and marketing organizations and analysis of third party market data  general economic conditions  specifically in the markets we serve  and trends in our accounts receivable 
in assessing the appropriateness of product inventory levels held by our resellers and the impact on potential product returns  we may limit sales to our distributors and vars in order to maintain inventory levels deemed by management to be appropriate 
we generally estimate our allowance for sales returns based on channel inventory levels between four to six weeks of expected future sales by our first tier distributors and vars  based on the criteria noted above 
we make these estimates based on channel inventory and sell through information that we obtain principally from our first tier distributors and vars 
product returns from our first tier distributors and vars are also impacted by actual product returns they receive directly from lower tiers of distribution for which we receive limited inventory and sell through information 
in addition  our estimates are based on historical product returns and channel inventory levels on a product by product basis for each of our primary sales regions 
as a result  actual product returns in future periods may differ from our estimates and may have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and consolidated results of operations due to factors including  but not limited to  market conditions and product release cycles 
at march   our channel inventory  net of related reserves  remained within the estimated channel inventory range noted above 
in fiscal years  and  product returns  consisting principally of stock rotation for obsolete products  totaled million  million and million  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
in fiscal years and  our product returns were impacted by transition and upgrade cycles associated with the launch of our mx product family in the first quarter of fiscal year and the upgrade of our mx product family to mx in the second quarter of fiscal year similarly  fiscal year product returns were impacted by new product offerings 
in general  we would expect the allowance for sales returns to increase following the announcement of new or upgraded versions of our products or in anticipation of such product announcements  as our distributors and vars seek to reduce their inventory levels of the prior version of a product in advance of receiving the new version 
similarly  we would expect that product inventory held by our distributors and vars would increase following the successful introduction of new or upgraded products  as these resellers stock the new version in anticipation of end user demand  which would result in a lower allowance for sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable and provide an allowance for a portion of our accounts receivable when collection becomes doubtful 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and the aging profile of customer accounts receivable and assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  our allowance for doubtful accounts has been sufficient to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot predict changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our allowance will continue to be sufficient 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater 
table of contents than the allowance that we have established  this would increase our operating expenses and reduce our reported net income 
our allowance for doubtful accounts amounted to million  or of gross accounts receivable  at march  and million  or of total gross accounts receivable  at march  the lower balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable at march  as compared to march  was based on improvement in certain accounts receivable metrics  most notably the aging of our receivable portfolio 
distributors account for a significant portion of our net revenues and accounts receivable balances and comprise several individually large accounts 
one of these distributors represented  and of consolidated net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  and and of our gross accounts receivable balances at march  and  respectively 
a second distributor represented  and of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  and and of our gross accounts receivable at march  and  respectively 
if the credit exposure associated with a large distributor relationship increased  affecting its ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to any particular industry or geographic region 
restructuring expenses and related accruals 
in fiscal year  we executed a restructuring plan to deliver cost synergies associated with our fiscal year acquisition of allaire and to better align our cost structure with the weaker business environment 
the million charge recorded as a result of the restructuring primarily related to facility exit costs to cancel or vacate approximately  square feet of facility space held under our operating leases and  to a lesser extent  employee termination and severance costs 
our restructuring expenses and accruals involved significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time that the estimates were made  some of which we have obtained and verified through real estate brokers 
these estimates include facility exit costs such as demise and lease termination costs  timing and market conditions of rental payments and estimated sublease income  and any fees associated with our restructuring expenses  such as brokerage fees 
on a regular basis we evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals 
such factors include  but are not limited to  market data in order to estimate the likelihood  timing  lease terms and rates to be realized from potential subleases of restructured facilities held under operating leases 
we also estimate costs associated with terminating certain leases on excess facilities 
these estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which may be beyond our control and include future real estate conditions and our ability to market and sublease excess facilities on terms acceptable to us  particularly in newton  massachusetts  northern california  bracknell  united kingdom  and to a lesser extent in richardson  texas and minneapolis  minnesota 
in addition  our restructuring estimates for facilities could be adversely impacted by the financial condition of sub lessees and their ability to meet the financial obligations throughout the term of any sublease agreement 
the impact of these estimated proceeds and costs are significant factors in determining the appropriateness of our restructuring accrual balance on our consolidated balance sheet at march  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and as such  may require adjustments to our restructuring accrual  which will impact our operating results in future periods 
as of march   our restructuring accrual balance included future minimum gross lease obligations for our restructured facilities extending through these future minimum gross lease obligations amounted to million  which will be offset by future sublease income of million to be received under contractual sublease arrangements 
in addition  our restructuring accrual balance is offset by estimated future sublease income of million 
the estimated future sublease balance is impacted by fluctuations in the demand in commercial real estate markets where we have significant operating lease obligations  notably the newton  massachusetts commercial real estate market 
accrued restructuring costs related to the newton lease represented of our total accrued restructuring at march  our newton space covers  square feet held under operating leases through  of which we currently occupy  square feet and sublease  square feet to existing subtenants 
of the  square feet that we currently sublease to existing 
table of contents tenants  subleases covering  square feet will expire at various dates commencing in july should the newton  massachusetts commercial real estate market deteriorate  we may not be able to find acceptable tenants at the rates or timing consistent with what we used in estimating our restructuring accrual 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process also involves estimating the impact of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations  primarily in foreign jurisdictions 
these examinations are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
accruals for tax contingencies require management to estimate the actual outcome of any such audits 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
our provision for income taxes is also dependent upon our estimation of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in our net deferred tax asset balance at each balance sheet date 
significant judgment is used to determine the likelihood that we will realize our deferred tax assets in the future  and includes our ability to forecast future taxable income 
an increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made

table of contents risk factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained in this annual report  the matters discussed herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including those detailed below and from time to time in our other reports filed with the sec 
the actual results that we achieve may differ significantly from any forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties 
our new product and version releases may not be successful and as a result our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from license sales of new software products and new versions of existing software products 
the success of new products and new versions of existing products  including the mx family of products released in fiscal  depends on the timing  market acceptance and performance of new products or new versions of existing products 
in the past we have experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancement of existing products and such delays may occur in the future 
if we are unable  due to resource constraints or technological reasons  to develop and introduce products in a timely manner  such inability could have a significantly adverse effect on our results of operations  including  in particular  our quarterly results 
in addition  market acceptance of our new product or version releases will be dependent on our ability to include functionality and usability in such releases that address the requirements of customer demographics with which we may have limited prior experience 
we must update our existing products and services to keep them current with changing technology  competitive offerings and consumer preferences and must develop new products and services to take advantage of new technologies that could otherwise render our existing products  or existing versions of such products  obsolete 
furthermore  our new product or version releases may contain undetected errors or bugs  which may result in product failures or security breaches or otherwise fail to perform in accordance with customer expectations 
in addition  such releases may not effectively guard against harmful or disruptive codes  including virus codes  new versions of which appear periodically  which may target files or programs created using our products 
the occurrence of errors or harmful codes could result in loss of market share  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation and the reputation of our products  or damage to our efforts to build positive brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we do not ship new products or new versions of our existing products as planned  if new product or version releases do not achieve adequate market acceptance  if new products or version releases fail to perform properly  or if we are unsuccessful in penetrating our business user and consumer markets  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and our future operating results and our stock price are subject to volatility our operating results for a particular period are extremely difficult to predict 
our net revenues depend significantly on general domestic and global economic conditions and the demand for software products in the markets in which we compete 
uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and any delays or reductions in information technology spending could result in a material and adverse effect on our operations 
our revenues may grow at a slower rate than experienced in previous periods and  in particular periods  may decline 
we have also experienced variability in revenue trends during our quarters  noting an increase in revenues in the last month of each quarter 
our efforts to manage our operating expenses may hinder our ability to achieve growth in our business and revenues 
any shortfall in revenues or results of operations from levels expected by securities analysts  general declines in economic conditions  or significant reductions in spending by our customers  could have an immediate and materially adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
in addition to factors specific to us  changes in analysts earnings estimates for us or our industry and factors affecting the corporate environment  our industry  or the securities markets in general may result in significant volatility in the trading price of our common stock 
we implemented a new integrated enterprise resource planning erp application which is scheduled to be operational in the first quarter of fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal year  we replaced our legacy erp applications used to support a substantial portion of our worldwide operations with an integrated erp application from a major enterprise software vendor 
this integrated erp application supports 
table of contents our management of inventory  order processing  shipping  accounting and human resource hr functions 
we may experience disruptions with our new integrated erp application that could prevent us from taking customer orders  shipping products or billing customers that could harm our business and our reputation 
in addition  our new erp application requires the services of employees with extensive knowledge of the specific business application we license and the business environment in which we operate 
in order to successfully operate our erp application  we must be able to attract new employees and retain a significant number of existing employees 
if we fail to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel required to maintain and operate our erp applications systems  our business could suffer 
we face intense competition we operate in a highly competitive market characterized by market and customer expectations to incorporate new features and to accelerate the release of new products 
these market factors represent both opportunities and competitive threats to us 
with respect to competitive threats our designer and developer tools compete directly and indirectly with products from major vendors including microsoft corporation microsoft  international business machines ibm and adobe 
our server software products compete in a highly competitive and rapidly changing market for application server technologies 
with respect to these products  we compete directly with products offered by microsoft  ibm  bea  sun and various other open source or free technologies 
our products marketed to business users  such as breeze and contribute  compete directly and indirectly with products offered by ibm and webex communications  inc our products offered to mobile operators and device manufacturers for use in consumer devices compete directly and indirectly with various technologies and products from both established and emerging vendors 
introduction of new products  or introduction of new functionalities in current products  by us or by other companies may intensify our current competitive pressures 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  technical and intellectual property resources than we do 
furthermore  we have a number of strategic alliances with large and complex organizations  some of which may compete with us in certain markets 
these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects  the goal of which is generally to achieve product compatibility  promote product adoption  or facilitate product distribution 
if successful  these relationships may be mutually beneficial 
however  these alliances carry an element of risk because  in most cases  we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we also have a strategic alliance and  at the same time  cooperate with that company in other business areas 
if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected  we could suffer delays in product development  encounter barriers to product adoption and distribution or fail to realize the anticipated economic benefit of the strategic alliance 
we may not be able to successfully defend or enforce our intellectual property rights because we are a software company  our business is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  as well as employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and license agreements  to protect our intellectual property rights and products 
policing unauthorized use of products and fully protecting our proprietary rights are difficult and we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be successful 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark protection may not be available in every country in which our products are distributed or used 
in particular  while we are unable to determine the exact extent of piracy of our software products  software piracy may depress our revenues 
while this would also adversely affect domestic revenue  revenue loss from piracy of our software products is believed to be even more significant outside of the united states  particularly in countries where laws provide less protection of intellectual property rights 
protection of our intellectual property rights also is difficult in situations where the company has taken certain actions to promote broader adoption of our technology 
for instance  in an effort to promote broader adoption of 
table of contents our technology  in particular the macromedia flash player and the macromedia shockwave player  we publish and grant industry standard setting organizations  user groups and third parties the right to use certain macromedia product specifications  file formats  application programming interfaces apis  and other information 
these specifications  file formats  apis and other information could be used to produce products that compete with and reduce demand for macromedia s own products 
our intellectual property enforcement rights may be diminished because of our decision to publish or license certain intellectual property in an effort to promote its adoption 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation from time to time  we are involved in legal disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of our  or of a third party s  intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is typically extremely costly  unpredictable and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of our management and key technical personnel 
in addition  any adverse decisions  including injunctions or damage awards entered against us  could subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from others  prevent us from distributing or licensing certain of our products  or cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
risk associated with acquisitions we have entered into business combinations with other companies in the past  including our acquisition of ehelp in december  and two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions generally involve significant risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  business strategy  services  technologies and corporate culture of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  overvaluation of the acquired companies and the acceptance of the acquired companies products and services by our customers 
in addition  future acquisitions would likely result in dilution to existing stockholders  if stock or stock options are issued  or the assumption of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
accordingly  any future acquisitions could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks associated with international operations international net revenues outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenues 
we rely primarily on third parties  including distributors  for sales and support of our software products in foreign countries and  accordingly  are dependent on their ability to promote and support our software products and in some cases  to translate them into foreign languages 
in addition  we have and may continue to  outsource specific development and quality assurance testing activities for certain of our software products to various foreign  independent third party contractors 
international business and operations are subject to a number of special risks  including foreign currency risk  foreign government regulation  reduced and or less predictable intellectual property protections  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  more prevalent software piracy  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables  potentially adverse tax consequences  
table of contents the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
additionally  we are uncertain whether the weaknesses experienced in certain foreign economies will continue in the foreseeable future due to  among other things  possible currency devaluation  liquidity problems and political and continued military hostilities 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce economic exposure associated with sales and asset balances denominated in the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
at march   the net notional amount of forward contracts outstanding in us dollars using the spot exchange rates in effect at march  amounted to million 
however  there can be no assurance that such contracts will adequately manage our exposure to currency fluctuations in the long term  as the average maturity of these foreign exchange forward contracts is less than twelve months 
our operating results are dependent  in part  on our distribution channels a substantial portion of our net revenues are derived from the sale of our software products through a variety of distribution channels  including traditional software distributors  educational distributors  vars  hardware and software superstores  retail dealers and oems 
although we have not experienced any material problems with our distribution channels  computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future 
our ability to effectively distribute products depends in part upon the financial and business conditions of our distribution channels 
in addition  one distributor represented  and of consolidated net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
a second distributor represented  and of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in business  with any one of our major distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations in future periods 
furthermore  the terms of the arrangement with a distributor  oem or reseller may result in us deferring recognition of revenue from such arrangement due to various factors  including future delivery and other obligations that we may have under such arrangement or failure by such party to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under such arrangement 
our revenues generated through our oem channels may also be impacted by the marketability and success of the corresponding oem products offered by these third parties 
while our products are marketed and sold through different levels of distribution channels  we maintain direct contractual relationships primarily with the first tier distributors  generally relying on such distributors to manage the relationship with second tier distributors and resellers with respect to the distribution  marketing and promotion of our licenses 
although we receive periodic reports from most of the distributors and resellers of our products  our reliance on our first tier distributors to assist us in managing the lower level distribution channels limits our ability to i anticipate and respond to excess inventory levels of  or change in demand for  our products by lower tier distributors or resellers  ii directly manage the marketing or promotion of our products by such lower tier distributors or resellers  and iii monitor the adequacy of training received with respect to our products by employees of such lower tier distributors or resellers 
therefore  if our first tier distributors are unable to continue to effectively assist us in marketing and selling our products to the lower tier distribution channels  the demand for and reputation of  our products may decrease and our operations and our financial results may be materially and adversely effected 
product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues the primary sales channels into which we sell our products throughout the world are a network of distributors and vars 
agreements with our distributors and vars contain specific product return privileges for stock rotation and obsolete products 
in general  we expect sales returns to increase following the announcement of new or upgraded versions of our products or in anticipation of such product announcements  as our distributors and resellers seek to reduce their inventory levels of the prior version of a product in advance of receiving the new version 
similarly  we expect that product inventory held by our distributors and resellers would increase following the successful introduction 
table of contents of new or upgraded products  as these resellers stock the new version in anticipation of end user demand  which would result in a decrease in our allowance for sales returns 
as part of our revenue recognition practices  we have established a reserve for estimated sales returns 
these reserves are based on a number of factors  including channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions 
actual product returns in excess of our reserve estimates would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and our results of operations 
changing our pricing and business model could adversely affect our business we periodically make changes to our product pricing or offer alternative methods of licensing our product  based on market conditions  customer demands  or in connection with marketing activities 
such increases in the pricing of our products may cause our customers to seek lower priced alternatives  decrease the aggregate demand for such products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  competition in our various markets may require us to reduce prices on certain products in such markets 
in the event that we are required to reduce the pricing of our products  we may not be able to offset the lower unit price with increased demand for the corresponding products 
furthermore  any changes in pricing of products in general may result in delays in transactions as our customers and our sales force adapt to such price changes and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
moreover  customer demand and competition in the market may require us to offer alternative methods of licensing our products 
in the event that we offer alternative methods of licensing our products  the revenues generated from licenses based on such alternative methods may not offset the loss of revenues from our existing method of licensing our products in any given period and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes or disruptions in services provided by third parties could disrupt our business we rely primarily on a single independent third party to produce and distribute our products 
if there is a temporary or permanent disruption of our supply from such manufacturer  we may not be able to replace the supply in sufficient time to meet the demand for our products 
any such failure to meet the demand for our products would adversely affect our revenues and might cause some users to purchase licenses to our competitors products to meet their requirements 
we rely on a limited number of independent third parties to provide support services to our customers 
if any of these third party service providers terminates its relationship with us or ceases to be able to continue to maintain such relationship with us  we may not have sufficient notice or time to avoid serious disruption to our business 
furthermore  if any such third party service providers fail to provide adequate or satisfactory support for our products  our reputation as well as the success of our products may be adversely affected 
moreover  we have and may continue to outsource specific development and quality assurance activities for certain of our products 
if such third party developers are not able to complete the development activities on time  the release of the corresponding new product or a new version may be delayed 
in addition  since we are unable to control the development activities outsourced by us to third parties  the portions of our product developed by such third parties may contain significant errors or bugs 
termination of licenses for technologies from third parties could cause delays  increased costs or reduced functionality that may result in a material reduction in our net revenues and higher costs we license and distribute third party technologies that are bundled with or embedded in our products 
if any of these licenses from third parties were terminated or were not renewed  or the third party technology were to become subject to an intellectual property dispute  we might not be able to ship our products in which these technologies are bundled or embedded 
we would then have to seek an alternative to such third party technology to the extent that such an alternative exists 
this could result in delays in releasing and or shipping our products  increased costs or reduced functionality of our products and material reduction in our net revenues 
adverse economic conditions in the commercial real estate market may affect our ability to sublease vacated portions of properties held under sublease in fiscal year  we executed a restructuring plan to deliver cost synergies associated with our prior acquisitions and to better align our cost structure with the weaker 
table of contents business environment 
during fiscal year  our restructuring expenses included  among other things  costs related to canceling or vacating approximately  square feet of facility space held under our operating leases 
we currently lease  square feet of space in northern california under operating leases which expire between and  of which  square feet of space is not currently occupied by us and is currently subleased or being marketed for sublease 
furthermore  we lease  square feet of space in newton  massachusetts  which expires in june  of which  square feet is currently subleased 
we also lease  square feet at a facility in richardson  texas  of which  square feet is currently being subleased 
our restructuring expenses and accruals involve significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time that the estimates were made  including market data obtained from real estate brokers in the local markets 
these estimates include evaluating the timing and market conditions of rental payments and sublease income 
any reductions in our operations  including staff reductions  may result in us vacating additional portions of properties held under operating leases prior to the expiration of the corresponding lease agreements 
the general adverse economic conditions in the areas in which we have significant leased properties have resulted in a surplus of business facilities making it difficult to sublease properties 
there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve during our lease period 
if market conditions deteriorate  we may be unable to sublease our excess leased properties at all or on terms acceptable to us  or we may not meet our expected estimated levels of subleasing income and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
system failures or system unavailability could harm our business we rely on our network infrastructure  internal technology systems and our websites for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
the hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  computer viruses and other similar events 
they are also subject to acts such as computer viruses  physical or electronic vandalism or other similar disruptions could also cause system interruptions  delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders 
we have developed disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events  as they could impact our sales and damage our reputation and the reputation of our products 
we may  however  have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption 
any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could result in disruption in our business operations  loss of revenues or damage to our reputation 
we may not be able to attract or retain key personnel our future growth and success depend  in part  on the continued service of our highly skilled employees  including  but not limited to  our management team and sales personnel 
our ability to attract and retain employees is dependent on a number of factors  including our continued ability to provide stock incentive awards  competitive cash compensation and cash bonuses 
the loss of key employees or an inability to effectively recruit new employees  as needed  could have a material adverse affect on our business and our ability to grow in the future 
legislative actions may cause our operating expenses to increase the sarbanes oxley act of and newly proposed or enacted rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec and the nasdaq stock market impose new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and independent auditors 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and any new rules promulgated by the sec or nasdaq  we may be required to hire additional personnel and use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
any of these developments could materially increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
future impairment assessments on certain intangible assets may result in additional impairment charges in fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  our goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but instead  reviewed at least annually for impairment 
significant changes in demand for our products or changes in market conditions in the principal markets in which we sell our products  could adversely impact the carrying value of these intangible assets 
in particular  if there is i a significant and other than temporary decline in the market value of our common stock  ii a decrease in the market value of a particular asset  and iii operating or cash 
table of contents flow losses combined with forecasted future losses  we could be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  should we develop and manage our business using discrete financial information for reporting units in the future  we may be required to allocate our goodwill balance to those reporting units  which may result in an impairment of part or all of our recorded goodwill 
changes in generally accepted accounting principles gaap may affect our reported results we prepare our financial statements in conformity with gaap 
gaap is subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
of particular significance are the gaap relating to the accounting treatment of employee stock options and the recognition of revenue in software licensing transactions 
a change in these policies could have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect the reporting of transactions completed prior to the announcement of a change 
changes in tax laws and regulations may increase our expenses and the cost of our products in october  the federal internet tax freedom act itfa was enacted 
the itfa imposed a three year moratorium on state and local taxes related to internet access and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce that expired october  in november  the moratorium was extended another two years until november in september  the house passed legislation hr that would permanently extend the moratorium 
on april   the senate approved the extension of the moratorium for another four years 
the house and senate bills must be reconciled before legislation can be enacted  the timing of which is unclear 
if the itfa is not extended or permanently enacted  state and local jurisdictions may seek to impose taxes on internet access or electronic commerce within their jurisdictions that could increase the selling costs of our products 
also  on july   the european union enacted legislation requiring all non european union vendors to collect value added tax vat on all electronically supplied goods or services sold to consumers in the european union 
compliance with this new european union tax legislation has increased the cost of our products to consumers in the european union and could decrease the demand for our products in that region 
changes in our tax rates could affect our future results our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or their interpretations 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our tax returns by the tax authorities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of us dollar denominated us treasury securities  us government agency securities  commercial paper  highly liquid corporate debt securities  money market funds and interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
cash balances in foreign currencies are primarily invested in money market funds and interest bearing bank accounts with financial institutions 
we account for our short term investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents and all of our short term investments are recorded as available for sale and accordingly are classified as current assets on our balance sheets 
securities with original maturities less than three months are classified as cash equivalents 
cash equivalents and short term investments include primarily fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  which carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
we mitigate interest rate volatility by investing in instruments with short maturities 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by placing these investments with high credit quality issuers 
we maintain portfolio liquidity by ensuring that underlying investments have active secondary or resale markets 

table of contents the table below represents cost  carrying amounts and the related weighted average effective interest rates by year of maturity for our cash equivalents and short term investments as of march  the table does not include cash of million held in deposit accounts as of march  for the fiscal years ending march  total cost carrying amount in millions  except interest rates cash equivalents average interest rate short term investments average interest rate total cash equivalents and short term investments foreign currency risk our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  among other factors differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
as a result  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we sell our products internationally in us dollars and certain foreign currencies  primarily the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
we regularly enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency revenues and operating expenses as well as subsequent receivables and payables 
our management s present strategy is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates over our fiscal year 
we account for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations results from the sale of products internationally in foreign currencies and from expenses in foreign currencies to support those sales 
we have a risk management program to reduce the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses from recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
this program involves the use of foreign exchange forward contracts in certain currencies  primarily the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
a foreign exchange forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are partially offset by gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts  so as to mitigate the income statement impact of significant foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we do not use foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
cash flow hedging 
we designate and document foreign exchange forward contracts related to forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and as a result  we apply hedge accounting for these contracts 
the critical terms of the foreign exchange forward contracts and the forecasted underlying transactions are matched at inception and forward contract effectiveness is calculated  at least quarterly  by comparing the change in the fair value of the contracts to the change in the fair value of the forecasted revenues or expenses  with the effective portion of the fair value of the hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci 
we record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial in fiscal year  in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
when the underlying forecasted transactions occur and impact earnings  the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is reclassified to net revenues or expenses 
in the event it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur  the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedges would be reclassified from aoci to other income expense at that time 
all values reported in aoci at march  will be reclassified to earnings in eight months or less 
at march   the outstanding cash flow hedging derivatives had maturities of twelve months or less 

table of contents balance sheet hedging 
we manage our foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities using foreign exchange forward contracts 
these derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in other income expense 
these derivative instruments substantially offset the remeasurement gains and losses recorded on identified foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
at march   our outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of twelve months or less 
our outstanding net foreign exchange forward contracts at march  are presented in the table below 
this table presents the net notional amount in us dollars using the spot exchange rates in effect at march  and the weighted average forward rates
