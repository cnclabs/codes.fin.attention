our restructuring and integration efforts continued in  and a plan to include the impact of eliminating functions resulting from our acquisition of medscape in december was initiated 
we have substantially completed our restructuring and integration efforts related to the and restructuring plans  with the primary exception being remaining lease payments of previously vacated facilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of webmd s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  short term and long term investments  deferred tax assets  income taxes  collectibility of customer receivables  prepaid content and distribution services  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  certain accrued expenses  accruals related to our restructuring program  contingencies and litigation 
we believe the following reflect our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue our revenue recognition policies for each reportable segment are as follows transaction services or webmd envoy 
healthcare payers and providers pay us fees for our services  generally on a per transaction basis or monthly basis 
we recognize revenue as we perform the service 
healthcare payers and providers also pay us one time implementation and annual maintenance fees 
we recognize revenue from these fees ratably over the term of the respective agreements 
physician services or webmd practice services 
healthcare providers pay us one time fees for the purchase of our practice management systems 
we recognize revenue from these one time fees when we enter into noncancelable agreements with our customers  the products have been delivered and there are no uncertainties regarding product acceptance and delivery  no significant future performance obligations exist  fees are fixed and determinable and collectability is probable 
amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred until we meet these criteria 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  but not for all of the delivered elements 
the residual method requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair value of such elements  as indicated by vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
healthcare providers also pay us fees for maintenance and support of their practice management system  including the hardware and software 
we recognize revenue from these fees ratably over the contract period  typically in one year or less 
healthcare providers also pay us fees for transmitting transactions to payers and patients 
we recognize revenue from these fees  which are generally paid on a monthly or per transaction basis  as we provide the service 
portal services or webmd health 
customers pay us for advertising  sponsorship  healthcare management tools  continuing medical education cme  content syndication and distribution  
table of contents and e commerce transactions related to our online distribution channels and the online and offline distribution channels of our strategic partners 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered 
revenues from sponsorship arrangements and healthcare management tools are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from cme arrangements is recognized over the period we satisfy the minimum credit hour requirements of the applicable agreements 
revenue from fixed fee content license or carriage fees is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
e commerce revenue is recognized when a subscriber or consumer utilizes our internet based services or purchases goods or services through our web site or co branded web site with one of our strategic partners 
subscription revenue  including subscription revenue from sponsorship arrangements  is recognized over the subscription period 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values  determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
plastic technologies or porex 
we develop  manufacture and distribute porous plastic products and components 
for standard products  we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  net of sales returns and allowances 
for sales of certain custom products  we recognize revenue upon completion and customer acceptance 
recognition of amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria is deferred until we meet these criteria 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible asset using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors  including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
during  we identified certain indicators of possible impairment of our long lived assets  primarily goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluated our long lived assets for impairment by determining identifiable cash flows to related asset groupings  and compared the projected undiscounted cash flows for each asset grouping to its carrying value 
once we determined there was an impairment  we quantified the impairment based on projected discounted cash flows 
as a result of this analysis in  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately billion 
there was no impairment of goodwill noted as a result of our impairment testing in or other unknown future indications of possible impairment charges  such as a significant downturn in one of our business segments or reporting units or general economic conditions  could result in an additional assessment of our long lived assets for impairment and could result in an additional impairment charge in the future 
investments our investments  at december   consisted principally of certificates of deposit  municipal bonds  asset backed securities  federal agency notes  us treasury notes and an equity investment in a publicly traded company 
for each reporting period  we evaluate the carrying value of our investments and record a loss on investments when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we do not recognize a gain on an investment until sold 
future changes in market or economic conditions or operating results of our investments could result in gains or losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion 
these loss carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
due to a lack of a history of generating taxable income  we record a valuation allowance equal to of our net deferred tax 
table of contents assets 
in the event that we are able to generate taxable earnings in the future and determine it is more likely than not that we can realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made which may increase income in the period that such determination was made 
restructuring and integration in connection with our restructuring and integration efforts  modifications to our strategic relationship with news corporation resulted in a change in the carrying value of advertising services we have the rights to  classified as prepaid content and distribution services 
we estimated the fair value of our rights under the new agreement using a discounted cash flow approach 
this estimate also affects the amortization of this asset in future periods over the contractual term 
also  in connection with our restructuring and integration efforts  we recorded charges for estimated future lease obligations and lease cancellation penalties related to exited facilities based on many different variables  such as the term to expiration  contractual rights under the lease agreement and current real estate market conditions 
future changes in any of these variables  such as a change in real estate market conditions  could have an impact on these estimates

we believe that  for the foreseeable future  we will have sufficient cash resources to meet the commitments described above and our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including the capital requirements related to the roll out of new or updated products in and our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of the integration of our businesses  retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels  our existing and new application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments  potential future acquisitions and additional repurchases of our common stock 
in addition  we have been incurring  and expect to continue to incur  costs relating to our own implementation of the hipaa transaction standards and for assistance we provide to our customers in their implementation efforts 
our ability to perform our services in compliance with hipaa and the cost to us of doing so will depend on  among other things  the status of the compliance efforts of our payer and provider customers and the extent of the need to adjust our systems and procedures in response to changes in their systems and procedures 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements

factors that may affect our future financial condition or results of operations this section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change  for the worse  existing trends in some or all of our businesses 
the occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of the common stock and convertible notes that we have issued 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing webmd 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations 
risks related to our relationships with customers and strategic partners webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected if we do not maintain relationships with practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare electronic data interchange  or edi  transactions we have developed relationships with practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare claims to increase the usage of our webmd envoy transaction services 
webmd practice services is a competitor of these practice management system vendors 
these vendors  as a result of our ownership of webmd practice services or for other reasons  may choose in the future to diminish or terminate their relationships with webmd envoy 
some other large submitters of claims compete with  or may have significant relationships with entities that compete with  webmd envoy or webmd health 
to the extent that we are not able to maintain mutually satisfactory relationships with the larger practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare edi transactions  webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected 
webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected if payers and providers conduct edi transactions without using a clearinghouse there can be no assurance that healthcare payers and providers will continue to use webmd envoy and other independent companies to transmit healthcare transactions 
some payers currently offer electronic data transmission services to healthcare providers that establish a direct link between the provider and payer  bypassing third party edi service providers such as webmd envoy 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing links to payers and providers or develop new connections on satisfactory terms  if at all 
although the standardization of formats and data standards required by hipaa is only partial and we believe that use of clearinghouses will continue to be the most efficient way for most providers to transact electronically with multiple payers  such standardization may facilitate additional use of direct edi links for transmission of transactions between a greater number of healthcare payers and providers without use of a clearinghouse 
any significant increase in the utilization of direct links between healthcare providers and payers could have a material adverse effect on webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results 

table of contents loss of a small number of sponsors could have a material adverse effect on webmd health s revenues a substantial portion of webmd health s revenues come from a relatively small number of companies 
thus  the loss of a small number of these relationships or a reduction in the purchases by a portion of these sponsors could have a material adverse effect on our portal services revenues 
we may lose such relationships or experience a reduction in purchases if customers decide not to renew their commitments or renew at lower levels  which may occur if we fail to meet our customers expectations or needs or fail to keep up with our competition or for reasons outside our control  including changes in economic and regulatory conditions affecting the healthcare industry or changes specific to the businesses of particular customers 
for more information  see risks related to providing products and services to the healthcare industry developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business below and business government regulation above 
third parties may bring claims as a result of the activities of our strategic partners or resellers of our products and services we could be subject to claims by third parties  and to liability  as a result of the activities  products or services of our strategic partners or resellers of our products and services 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending these claims could be expensive  time consuming and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 
risks related to the development and performance of our healthcare information services and technology solutions our ability to generate revenue could suffer if we do not continue to update and improve our existing products and services and develop new ones we must introduce new healthcare information services and technology solutions and improve the functionality of our existing products and services in a timely manner in order to retain existing customers and attract new ones 
however  we may not be successful in responding to technological and regulatory developments and changing customer needs 
the pace of change in the markets we serve is rapid  and there are frequent new product and service introductions by our competitors and by vendors whose products and services we use in providing our own products and services 
if we do not respond successfully to technological and regulatory changes and evolving industry standards  our products and services may become obsolete 
technological changes may also result in the offering of competitive products and services at lower prices than we are charging for our products and services  which could result in our losing sales unless we lower the prices we charge 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the products we develop or license will be able to compete with the alternatives available to our customers 
for more information about the competition we face  see business healthcare information services and technology solutions competition for our healthcare information services and technology solutions above 
developing and implementing new or updated products and services may take longer and cost more than expected we rely on a combination of internal development  strategic relationships  licensing and acquisitions to develop our products and services 
the cost of developing new healthcare information services and technology solutions is inherently difficult to estimate 
our development and implementation of proposed products and services may take longer than originally expected  require more testing than originally anticipated and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources 
if we are unable to develop new or updated products and services on a timely basis and implement them without significant disruptions to the existing systems and processes of our customers  we may lose potential sales and harm our relationships with current or potential customers 

table of contents for example  we have been incurring  and expect to continue to incur  significant expenses relating to implementation of the hipaa electronic transaction and code sets standards and our all payer suite of services  including expenses for additional technical and customer service personnel 
implementation of the hipaa transaction standards requires us  among other things  to make significant changes to the software webmd envoy uses internally  to engage in testing with its customers and to implement additional quality assurance processes 
if our reprogramming and testing are not completed on a timely basis  we could lose customers and revenues 
implementation of our all payer suite of transaction services requires us to expand our connectivity to support a broader set of transaction services to non commercial payers in key markets as well as to improve the functional capability of our claims and accounts receivable management solutions 
we may not have enough technicians  programmers and customer service personnel to meet the demands placed on those functions by our customers and partners during the implementation period  which could adversely affect our relationships with them 
the amount and timing of future expenses for the hipaa and all payer implementations are difficult to estimate and may exceed amounts we have budgeted or continue for longer than expected 
for more information about hipaa see business government regulation above 
for a description of our all payer suite of services see business healthcare information services and technology solutions webmd envoy edi transaction services medical and dental administrative services above 
new or updated products and services will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of market acceptance there can be no assurance that healthcare providers and payers will accept from us new or updated products and services or products and services that result from integrating existing and or acquired products and services 
providers and payers may choose to use similar products and services from our competitors if they are already using products and services of those competitors and have made extensive investments in hardware  software and training relating to those products and services 
even providers and payers who are already our customers may not purchase new or updated products or services  especially when they are initially offered 
providers and payers using our existing products and services may refuse to adopt new or updated products and services when they have made extensive investments in hardware  software and training relating to those existing products and services 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any such products and services will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
failure to achieve broad penetration in target markets with respect to new or updated products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
for example  we are working to transform webmd envoy from a commercial claims clearinghouse to a supplier of a full complement of reimbursement cycle management solutions  including outsourcing of pre and post adjudication services for payer customers  sending claims transactions and receiving electronic remittance advice transactions for our provider and vendor customers  and other value added services 
however  there can be no assurance that customers who use our services for sending and receiving claims will use our other services  that our other services will attract additional customers or that such services will generate sufficient revenues to cover the costs of developing  marketing and providing those services 
achieving market acceptance of new or updated products and services is likely to require significant efforts and expenditures achieving market acceptance for new or updated products and services is likely to require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry 
in addition  deployment of new or updated products and services may require the use of additional resources for training our existing sales force and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional salespersons and customer service personnel 
there can be no assurance that 
table of contents the revenue opportunities from new or updated products and services will justify amounts spent for their development  marketing and roll out 
we could be subject to breach of warranty  product liability or other claims if our software products  information technology systems or transmission systems contain errors or experience failures undetected errors in the software and systems we provide to customers or the software and systems we use to provide services could cause serious problems for our customers 
for example  errors in our transaction processing systems can result in healthcare payers paying the wrong amount or making payments to the wrong payee 
if problems like these occur  our customers may seek compensation from us or may seek to terminate their agreements with us  withhold payments due to us  seek refunds from us of part or all of the fees charged under those agreements or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures 
we also provide products and services that assist in healthcare decision making  including some that relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans 
if these products malfunction or fail to provide accurate and timely information  we could be subject to product liability claims 
in addition  we could face breach of warranty or other claims or additional development costs if our software and systems do not meet contractual performance standards  do not perform in accordance with their documentation  or do not meet the expectations that our customers have for them 
our software and systems are inherently complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in prior versions  current versions or future versions or enhancements 
see also during times when we are making significant changes to our products and services  there are increased risks of performance problems below 
we attempt to limit  by contract  our liability for damages arising from negligence  errors or mistakes 
however  contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable in certain circumstances or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages 
we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors and omissions 
however  it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
in addition  negative publicity caused by these events may delay market acceptance of our products and services  including unrelated products and services 
performance problems with webmd envoy s systems or system failures could cause us to lose customers or cause customers to reduce the number of transactions we process for them we process payer and provider transactions and data at our own facilities and at a data center in tampa  florida that is operated by an independent third party 
we have contingency plans for emergencies with our systems  however  we have limited backup facilities to process information if these facilities are not functioning 
the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities or at the third party facility could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data  which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our payer and provider customer satisfaction and our business could be harmed if webmd envoy experiences transmission delays or failures or loss of data in its systems 
webmd envoy s systems are complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that problems will not occur or that they will be detected and corrected promptly if they do occur

during times when we are making significant changes to our products and services  there are increased risks of performance problems if we do not respond successfully to technological and regulatory changes and evolving industry standards  our products and services may become obsolete

table of contents ones 
the software and systems that we sell and that we use to provide services are inherently complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in any enhancements  updates and new versions that we market or use 
even if new products and services do not have performance problems  our technical and customer service personnel may have difficulties in installing them or in their efforts to provide any necessary training and support to customers 
for example  we have had and may continue to have transmission or processing problems relating to implementation of the hipaa electronic transaction and code sets standards and our all payer suite of services 
see developing and implementing new or updated products and services may take longer and cost more than expected above 
these problems include transmission failures resulting from sending large batches of electronic transactions to non commercial payers who have been accustomed to receiving transactions through a greater number of smaller batches  enrollment and other set up errors resulting from the implementation of large numbers of customers simultaneously  and various other transmission  processing  interfacing and service problems resulting from the implementation of new software and new business processes 
if our systems or the internet experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure  our business could suffer a significant security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability 
we retain and transmit confidential information  including patient health information  in our processing centers and other facilities 
it is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and be perceived by the marketplace as secure 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with  including the internet and related systems  may be vulnerable to physical break ins  hackers  improper employee or contractor access  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
any compromise of our security  whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with  could reduce demand for our services 
see also business government regulation health insurance portability and accountability act of security standards 
performance problems with webmd envoy s systems could affect our relationships with customers of our practice services business webmd envoy provides the transaction services  including the all payer transaction services  used by the medical manager network services customers of our practice services business 
as an increasing number of our webmd practice services customers rely on us to provide our all payer suite of transaction services  disruptions to those services could cause some of those customers to obtain some or all of their software support requirements from competitors of ours or could cause some customers to switch to a competing physician practice management or billing software solution 
webmd envoy s ability to provide transaction services depends on services provided by telecommunications companies webmd envoy relies on a limited number of suppliers to provide some of the telecommunications services necessary for its transaction services 
the telecommunications industry has been subject to significant changes as a result of changes in technology  regulation and the underlying economy 
recently  many telecommunications companies have experienced financial problems and some have sought bankruptcy protection 
some of these companies have discontinued telecommunications services for which they had contractual obligations to webmd envoy 
webmd envoy s inability to source telecommunications services at reasonable prices due to a loss of competitive suppliers could affect its ability to maintain its margins until it is able to raise its prices to its customers and  if it is not able to raise its prices  could have a material adverse effect on its financial results 

table of contents risks related to providing products and services to the healthcare industry developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business almost all of the revenues of webmd health  webmd envoy and webmd practice services come from customers in various parts of the healthcare industry 
in addition  a significant portion of porex s revenues come from products used in healthcare or related applications 
developments that result in a reduction of expenditures by customers or potential customers in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
general reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from  among other things government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients  payers or other healthcare industry participants  including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services for additional discussion of the potential effects of regulatory matters on our business and on participants in the healthcare industry  see the other risks related to providing products and services to the healthcare industry described below in this section and business government regulation above  consolidation of healthcare industry participants  reductions in governmental funding for healthcare  and adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers  pharmaceutical companies  medical device manufacturers or other healthcare industry participants 
even if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase  developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending on information technology and services or in some or all of the specific segments of that market we serve or are planning to serve 
for example  use of our products and services could be affected by changes in the billing patterns of healthcare providers  changes in the design of health insurance plans  changes in the contracting methods payers use in their relationships with providers  and decreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical companies or medical device manufacturers  including as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit promotional activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies 
in addition  expectations of our customers regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to products and services of the types we provide 
the healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur 
however  the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict 
we cannot provide assurance that the markets for our products and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical  financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets 
the hipaa transaction and code set standards creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts  business strategies and customer relationships application of the transaction standards to webmd 
october  was the deadline for covered entities to comply with hipaa s electronic transaction and code sets standards which we refer to as the transaction standards 
failure to comply with the transaction standards may subject webmd envoy to civil monetary penalties  and possibly to criminal penalties 
on july   the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  released its guidance on compliance with hipaa transactions and code sets after the october  implementation deadline which we refer to as the cms guidance 
in addition  on july   cms officials participated in an open door forum teleconference during 
table of contents which they provided additional clarification on planned enforcement practices 
cms also urged the adoption of contingency plans to help prevent disruptions in the healthcare payment system 
under cms s contingency plan for medicare  it will continue to accept claims in both hipaa standard and legacy formats  with the legacy formats to be accepted for a period to be determined by cms based upon a regular reassessment of the readiness of its electronic trading partners 
in response  webmd envoy announced a contingency plan  pursuant to which it continues to process hipaa standard transactions and  for a limited period of time  will also process legacy transactions as appropriate based on the needs of our business partners 
on february   cms modified its medicare contingency plan to delay the payment of electronic claims that are not hipaa compliant 
specifically  effective july   only claims that are compliant with the transaction standards are to be reported as electronic media claims emc  which may be paid no earlier than after a day waiting period 
all other claims including both electronic claims that are not compliant with the transaction standards  as well as paper claims may be paid no earlier than after a day waiting period 
calling it a measured step toward ending the contingency plan entirely  cms implemented the change to encourage providers to move more quickly with their efforts to achieve hipaa compliance 
this policy may provide an incentive for providers who cannot send hipaa standard claims from their desktop to use a clearinghouse  such as webmd envoy  to do so 
cms has made clear that it expects each party to every transaction to be accountable for compliance with the new standards 
however  the cms guidance provides for a flexible  complaint driven enforcement strategy that will take into consideration good faith efforts to comply with the transaction standards 
we believe that cms s enforcement approach assisted in reducing disruptions in the flow of electronic transactions that otherwise could have occurred 
however  one short term effect of cms s approach and related transition matters may be that  as a result of the extended period of testing and implementation  there could be fewer electronic transactions for us to process in than would otherwise have been the case 
we cannot provide assurance regarding how cms will regulate clearinghouses in general or webmd envoy in particular 
in addition  even though major disruptions in the flow of electronic transactions may be less likely in light of cms s current approach to enforcement of the transaction standards  we have experienced isolated disruptions and some delays and we expect that there will continue to be some problems for a period of time 
we continue to work diligently to identify and resolve problems as they occur 
the costs to us of dealing with those problems are inherently difficult to estimate and may be more than we expect and or continue for longer than anticipated 
in addition  most of our trading partners are currently operating under their own contingency plans and  accordingly  we would expect that there will be further disruptions during the adjustment period that occurs once cms requires all applicable parties to perform in accordance with the transaction standards 
we may not have enough technicians  programmers and customer service personnel to meet the demands placed on those functions by our customers and partners during that adjustment period  which could adversely affect our relationships with them 
implementation challenges 
implementation of the transaction standards has presented us with significant technical and operational challenges 
for example  the transaction standards cover not only transaction formats  but also required content  including some content not previously collected by most providers 
we are working with our trading partners to complete quality assurance and testing on our enhanced clearinghouse data services for transmitting additional data content provided for in the transaction standards 
we do not plan to place these services into full production until both our systems and payers adjudication systems are capable of handling the production volume of transactions with the additional data content 
as with any highly complex data transition involving significant modifications to trading partner systems  we are experiencing some problems during this process 
another aspect of the implementation challenges resulting from the transaction standards is the increase in computing capacity required 
the transaction standards formats are much larger than the pre existing ones 
we are utilizing more computing capacity than we had anticipated 
as a result  our systems have experienced inefficiencies that have resulted in processing delays 
we seek to resolve all such problems when identified  but testing 
table of contents continues with numerous submitters and payers and no assurance can be given that we will identify all problems promptly or that we will not continue to experience problems that delay the full implementation of these enhanced data services 
see also developing and implementing new or updated products and services may take longer and cost more than expected and during times when we are making significant changes to our products and services  there are increased risks of performance problems above 
from october  to the date of this annual report  a large majority of the claims we have received from submitters used legacy formats and very few contained the additional data content provided for in the transaction standards 
a small number of our submitters currently send some additional hipaa data content that does not yet pass through our clearinghouse 
in order to facilitate transmission of claims with the standard hipaa format  our clearinghouse software uses edits  including the use of default data  in the transmission of claims from our clearinghouse and some data received by us is not transmitted by us 
to date  our software  editing procedures and production criteria for additional hipaa content have not had a material effect on our ability to process and transmit transactions 
implementation costs 
we have been incurring  and expect to continue to incur  significant expenses relating to implementation of the transaction standards 
implementation of the transaction standards requires us  among other things  to make significant changes to the software webmd envoy uses internally  to engage in testing with its customers and to implement additional quality assurance processes 
if our reprogramming and testing are not completed on a timely basis  we could lose customers and revenues 
in addition  our ability to perform our transaction services in compliance with hipaa and the cost to us of doing so will depend on  among other things  the status of the compliance efforts of our payer and provider customers and the extent of the need to adjust our systems and procedures in response to changes in their systems and procedures 
we cannot control when or how payers  providers  practice management system vendors or other healthcare participants will comply with the transaction standards or predict how their compliance efforts will affect their relationships with us  including the volume of transactions for which they use our services 
our technological and strategic responses to the transaction standards may result in conflicts with  or other adverse changes in our relationships with  some healthcare industry participants  including some who are existing or potential customers for our products and services or existing or potential strategic partners 
use of direct links 
although the standardization of formats and data standards required by hipaa is only partial and we believe that use of clearinghouses will continue to be the most efficient way for most providers to transact electronically with multiple payers  such standardization may facilitate use of direct edi links  for transmission of transactions between a greater number of healthcare payers and providers without use of a clearinghouse 
any significant increase in the utilization of direct links between healthcare providers and payers could have a material adverse effect on webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results

see business healthcare information services and technology solutions webmd health medscape from webmd continuing medical education cme above 
our cme activities are planned and implemented in accordance with the essential areas and policies of the accreditation council for continuing medical education  or accme  which oversees providers of cme credit 
in august  accme awarded medscape a two year provisional accreditation as a cme 
table of contents provider  allowing medscape to certify online cme activities 
provision of cme is also subject to government regulation by the fda and the office of inspector general  or oig  of the united states department of health and human services  a federal agency responsible for interpreting certain federal laws relating to healthcare 
among the goals of regulation of cme is ensuring that funding of cme programs by pharmaceutical and medical device companies is not a means of providing improper remuneration to physicians or others in a position to generate business for those companies and does not result in improper influence or control of the content of cme programs by the sponsoring companies 
see business government regulation regulation of healthcare relationships and fda and ftc regulation of advertising above and other government regulation of healthcare and healthcare information technology creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies below 
increased scrutiny by regulators of cme sponsorship by pharmaceutical or medical device companies  changes to existing regulation or accme guidelines or changes in internal compliance procedures of potential sponsors may require medscape to make changes in the way it offers or provides cme programs  may slow sponsors internal approval processes for cme  and may reduce the volume of sponsored cme programs implemented by medscape to levels that are lower than expected 
other government regulation of healthcare and healthcare information technology creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies general 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  regulatory and other influences 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider programs to reform or revise the united states healthcare system 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our applications and services 
we are unable to predict future proposals with any certainty or to predict the effect they would have on our business 
in addition  existing laws and regulations could create liability  cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations 
although we carefully review our practices with regulatory experts in an effort to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws  these laws are complex and subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities  who may take positions that are inconsistent with our practices 
healthcare relationships 
a federal law commonly known as the federal healthcare programs anti kickback law and several similar state laws prohibit payments that are intended to induce healthcare providers either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services 
these laws are broad and may apply to some of our activities or our relationships with our customers  advertisers or strategic partners 
other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment from medicare  medicaid  or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent  or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed 
since we provide transaction services to healthcare providers  we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard errors in transactions processed by us as inadvertent and not in violation of these laws 
in addition  our transaction services include providing edits  using logic  mapping and defaults  to enhance the information submitted in claims in order to assist in claims processing 
we believe that our editing practices are in compliance with industry practice and applicable laws  however  it is possible that a court or governmental agency might interpret these laws in a different manner  which could result in liability and adversely affect our business 
in addition  changes in these laws could also require us to incur costs or restrict our business operations 
many anti kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial 
even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our practices could cause us adverse publicity and be costly for us to respond to 

table of contents regulation of medical devices 
certain of porex s products are medical devices regulated by the food and drug administration  or fda  such as plastic and reconstructive surgical implants  intravenous administration sets  blood filters  and tissue expanders 
these products are subject to comprehensive government regulation under the food  drug and cosmetic act and implementing regulations 
in addition  the fda regulates webmd practice services dim 
dx 
system as a medical image management device 
if the fda were to find that we have not complied with required procedures  it can bring a wide variety of enforcement actions that could result in severe civil and criminal sanctions 
porex is also subject to similar regulation in international markets  with similar risks 
future products that we wish to bring to market may require clearances or approvals from governmental authorities  which may be expensive  time consuming and burdensome to obtain or which may never be obtained

our failure  or the failure of our business partners  to accurately anticipate the application of applicable laws and regulations  or any other failure to comply  could create liability for us  result in adverse publicity  or negatively affect our business 
in addition  new laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  may be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services covering user privacy  patient confidentiality  consumer protection and other issues  including pricing  content  copyrights and patents  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
we cannot predict whether these laws or regulations will change or how such changes will affect our business

we face potential liability related to the privacy and security of personal information we collect on our web sites internet user privacy has become a controversial issue both in the united states and abroad 
we have privacy policies posted on our consumer portal and our professional portal that we believe comply with applicable laws requiring notice to users about our information collection  use and disclosure practices 
however  whether and how existing privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the internet is still uncertain and may take years to resolve 
any legislation or regulation in the area of privacy of personal information could affect the way we operate our web sites and could harm our business 
further  we can give no assurance that the statements on our portals  or our practices  will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity in this area

our ability to maintain or increase our portal services sponsorship revenues will depend  in part  on our ability to retain or increase usage of our portal services by consumers and physicians webmd health generates revenues by  among other things  selling sponsorships of specific pages  sections or events on its online physician and consumer portals and related e mailed newsletters 
our webmd health sponsors include pharmaceutical  biotech  medical device and consumer products 
table of contents companies that are interested in communicating with and educating our audience or parts of our audience 
while we currently attract a large audience of health involved consumers and clinically active healthcare professionals to our online offerings  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to do so 
users of our portals have numerous other online and offline sources of healthcare information services 
in addition  some of webmd health s traffic and new members come to it through relationships with third parties  including msn and aol  and  as a result  depends on the amount of traffic to sites of the third parties and other factors outside our control and may cease if the relationship ends 
implementation of changes in hardware and software platforms used to deliver our web sites may result in performance problems from time to time  we implement changes to the hardware and software platforms we use for creating and delivering our web sites 
during and after the implementation of those changes  a platform may not perform as expected  which could result in interruptions in the operation of our web sites  an increase in response time of those sites or an inability to track performance metrics 
any significant interruption in our ability to operate our web sites could have an adverse effect on our relationship with users and sponsors and  as a result  on our financial results 
our internet based services rely on third party service providers our web sites are designed to operate hours a day  seven days a week  without interruption 
to do so  we rely on communications and hosting services provided by third parties 
we do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services 
to operate without interruption  both we and our service providers must guard against damage from fire  power loss and other natural disasters  communications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  security breaches  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
we have experienced periodic system interruptions in the past  and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur again 
in addition  our web sites may  at times  be required to accommodate higher than usual volumes of traffic 
at those times  our web sites may experience slower response times or system failures 
any sustained or repeated interruptions or disruptions in these systems or increase in their response times could result in reduced usage of our web sites and could damage our relationships with strategic partners  advertisers and sponsors 
although we maintain insurance for our business  we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur or to provide for costs associated with business interruptions 
our internet based services are dependent on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure our ability to deliver our internet based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience increased usage  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it 
in addition  the performance of the internet may be harmed by increased usage 

table of contents the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet based services 
in addition  our customers who utilize our web based services depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web site 
all of these providers have experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties in the future due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
any significant interruptions in our services or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users of and advertisers and sponsors on our web site and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services 
third parties may challenge the enforceability of our online agreements the law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving 
we could be subject to claims by third parties that our online agreements with consumers and physicians that provide the terms and conditions for use of our portal services are unenforceable 
a finding by a court that these agreements are invalid could harm our business and require costly changes to our portals 
third parties may bring claims against us as a result of content provided on our web sites  which may be expensive and time consuming to defend we could be subject to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied on our web sites by us or third parties  including content providers  medical advisors or users 
we could also be subject to liability for content that may be accessible through our web sites or third party web sites linked from our web sites or through content and information that may be posted by users in chat rooms  bulletin boards or on web sites created by professionals using our web site application 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
risks related to porex s business and industry porex s success depends upon demand for its products  which in some cases ultimately depends upon end user demand for the products of its customers demand for our porex products may change materially as a result of economic or market conditions and other trends that affect the industries in which porex participates 
in addition  because a significant portion of our porex products are components that are eventually integrated into or used with products manufactured by customers for resale to end users  the demand for these product components is dependent on product development cycles and marketing efforts of these other manufacturers  as well as variations in their inventory levels  which are factors that we are unable to control 
accordingly  the amount of porex s sales to manufacturer customers can be difficult to predict and subject to wide quarter to quarter variances 
porex s success may depend on satisfying rapidly changing customer requirements a significant portion of our porex products are integrated into end products used in various industries  some of which are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and practices and frequent new product introductions 
accordingly  porex s success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner products that meet changing customer requirements and to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors 
if we do not introduce new porex products in a timely manner and make enhancements to existing products to meet the changing needs of our porex customers  some of our products could become obsolete over time  in which case our customer relationships  revenue and operating results would be negatively impacted 

table of contents potential new or enhanced porex products may not achieve sufficient sales to be profitable or justify the cost of their development we cannot be certain  when we engage in porex research and development activities  whether potential new products or product enhancements will be accepted by the customers for which they are intended 
achieving market acceptance for new or enhanced products may require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by potential customers 
in addition  sales and marketing efforts with respect to these products may require the use of additional resources for training our existing porex sales forces and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional salespersons and customer service personnel 
there can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from new or enhanced products will justify amounts spent for their development and marketing 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any new or enhanced porex products will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
porex may not be able to source the raw materials it needs or may have to pay more for those raw materials some of porex s products require high grade plastic resins with specific properties as raw materials 
while porex has not experienced any material difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of high grade plastic resins that meet its requirements  it relies on a limited number of sources for some of these plastic resins 
if porex experiences a reduction or interruption in supply from these sources  it may not be able to access alternative sources of supply within a reasonable period of time or at commercially reasonable rates  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results 
disruptions in porex s manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results any significant disruption in porex s manufacturing operations  including as a result of fire  power interruptions  equipment malfunctions  labor disputes  material shortages  earthquakes  floods  computer viruses  sabotage  terrorist acts or other force majeure  could have a material adverse effect on porex s ability to deliver products to customers and  accordingly  its financial results 
the nature of porex s products exposes it to product liability claims that may not be adequately covered by indemnity agreements or insurance the products sold by porex  whether sold directly to end users or sold to other manufacturers for inclusion in the products that they sell  expose it to potential risk of product liability claims  particularly with respect to porex s life sciences  clinical  surgical and medical products 
some of porex s products are designed to be permanently implanted in the human body 
design defects and manufacturing defects with respect to such products sold by porex or failures that occur with the products of porex s manufacturer customers that contain components made by porex could result in product liability claims and or a recall of one or more of porex s products 
porex also manufactures products that are used in the processing of blood for medical procedures and the delivery of medication to patients 
porex believes that it carries adequate insurance coverage against product liability claims and other risks 
we cannot assure you  however  that claims in excess of porex s insurance coverage will not arise 
in addition  porex s insurance policies must be renewed annually 
although porex has been able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost in the past  we cannot assure you that porex will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost 
in most instances  porex enters into indemnity agreements with its manufacturing customers 
these indemnity agreements generally provide that these customers would indemnify porex from liabilities that may arise from the sale of their products that incorporate porex components to  or the use of such products by  end users 
while porex generally seeks contractual indemnification from its customers  any such indemnification is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party 
if porex does not have adequate contractual indemnification available  product liability claims  to the extent

for a description of these actions  see the information under legal proceedings porex mammary implant litigation above 
economic  political and other risks associated with porex s international sales and geographically diverse operations could adversely affect porex s operations and results since porex sells its products worldwide  its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in addition  porex has manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom  germany and malaysia 
accordingly  porex s operations and financial results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulties in managing international and geographically diverse operations  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
environmental regulation could adversely affect porex s business porex is subject to foreign and domestic environmental laws and regulations and is subject to scheduled and random checks by environmental authorities 
porex s business involves the handling  storage and disposal of materials that are classified as hazardous 
although porex s safety procedures for handling  storage and disposal of these materials are designed to comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  porex may be held liable for any environmental damages that result from porex s operations 
porex may be required to pay fines  remediation costs and damages  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
risks applicable to our entire company the ongoing investigations by the united states attorney for the district of south carolina and the sec could negatively impact our company and divert management attention from our business operations the united states attorney for the district of south carolina is conducting an investigation of our company 
as more fully described in legal proceedings above  based on the information available to webmd as of the date of this annual report  we believe that the investigation relates principally to issues of financial reporting for medical manager corporation  a predecessor of webmd by its merger into webmd in september  and our medical manager health systems subsidiary  however  we cannot be sure of the investigation s exact scope or how long it may continue 
in addition  webmd understands that the sec is conducting a formal investigation into this matter 
adverse developments in connection with the investigations  if any  including as a result of matters that the authorities or webmd may discover  could have a negative impact on our company and on how it is perceived by investors and potential investors and customers and potential customers 
in addition  the management effort and 
table of contents attention required to respond to the investigations and any such developments could have a negative impact on our business operations 
webmd intends to continue to fully cooperate with the authorities in this matter 
while we are not able to estimate  at this time  the amount of the expenses that we will incur in connection with the investigations  we expect that they may be significant 
we face significant competition for our products and services the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive  continually evolving and  in some cases  subject to rapid technological change 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do 
these organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations or any alliances they have formed or may form 
for more information about the competition we face  see business healthcare information services and technology solutions competition for our healthcare information services and technology solutions and business porex competition above 
the performance of our businesses depends on attracting and retaining qualified executives and employees our performance depends on attracting and retaining key personnel  including executives  product managers  software developers and other technical personnel and sales and marketing personnel 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our business and the results of our operations 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights our intellectual property is important to all of our businesses 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures and non disclosure contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we believe that our non patented proprietary technologies and business and manufacturing processes are protected under trade secret  contractual and other intellectual property rights 
however  those rights do not afford the statutory exclusivity provided by patented processes 
in addition  the steps that we take to protect our intellectual property  proprietary information and trade secrets may prove to be inadequate and  whether or not adequate  may be expensive 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect potential or actual misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property  proprietary information or trade secrets 
even if we detect misappropriation or infringement by a third party  there can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce our rights at a reasonable cost  or at all 
in addition  our rights to intellectual property  proprietary information and trade secrets may not prevent independent third party development and commercialization of competing products or services 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services we could be subject to claims that we are misappropriating or infringing intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend and divert management s attention from our operations 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing these rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products or services that use or contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing products or services or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we may also be required to indemnify our customers if they become subject to third party claims relating to intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to them  which could be costly 

table of contents we have incurred and may continue to incur losses we began operations in january and have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion 
although we generated net income  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  in the quarters ended december   september  and september   we incurred a net loss for the year ended december  we currently intend to continue to invest in infrastructure development  applications development  sales and marketing  and acquisitions and whether we continue to incur losses in a particular period will depend on  among other things  the amount of such investments and whether those investments lead to increased revenues

for information regarding certain proceedings to which we are currently a party  see legal proceedings above 
business combinations and other transactions may be difficult to complete and  if completed  may have negative consequences for our business and our securityholders we intend to seek to acquire or to engage in business combinations with companies engaged in complementary businesses 
in addition  we may enter into joint ventures  strategic alliances or similar arrangements with third parties 
these transactions may result in changes in the nature and scope of our operations and changes in our financial condition 
our success in completing these types of transactions will depend on  among other things  our ability to locate suitable candidates and negotiate mutually acceptable terms with them  as well as the availability of financing 
significant competition for these opportunities exists  which may increase the cost of and decrease the opportunities for these types of transactions 
financing for these transactions may come from several sources  including cash and cash equivalents on hand and marketable securities  proceeds from the incurrence of indebtedness  and proceeds from the issuance of additional common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt or other securities 
our issuance of additional securities could cause substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time of the issuance  cause substantial dilution of our earnings per share  and adversely affect the prevailing market price for our outstanding securities 
we do not intend to seek securityholder approval for any such acquisition or security issuance unless required by applicable law or regulation or the terms of existing securities 
our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to assess the risks in particular transactions we have in the past acquired  and may in the future acquire  businesses  technologies  services  product lines and other assets 
the successful integration of the acquired businesses and assets into our operations  on a cost effective basis  can be critical to our future performance 
the amount and timing of the expected benefits of any acquisition  including potential synergies between webmd and the acquired 
table of contents business  are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those relating to our ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business  our ability to cross sell products and services to customers with which we have established relationships and those with which the acquired businesses have established relationships  our ability to retain or replace key personnel  potential conflicts in payer  provider  strategic partner  sponsor or advertising relationships  our ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and may have different business cultures  and compliance with regulatory requirements 
we cannot guarantee that any acquired businesses will be successfully integrated with our operations in a timely or cost effective manner  or at all 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to achieve anticipated operating synergies  revenue enhancements or cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although our management attempts to evaluate the risks inherent in each transaction and to value acquisition candidates appropriately  we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain all such risks or that acquired businesses and assets will perform as we expect or enhance the value of our company as a whole 
in addition  acquired companies or businesses may have larger than expected liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification  if any  we are able to obtain from the sellers 
we may not be able to raise additional funds when needed for our business or to exploit opportunities our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of the integration of our businesses  our existing and new applications and service offerings  competing technologies and market developments  potential future acquisitions and additional repurchases of our common stock 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 
this objective is accomplished by adherence to our investment policy  which establishes the list of eligible types of securities and credit requirements for each investment 
changes in prevailing interest rates will cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities in commercial paper  non government debt securities  money market funds and highly liquid united states treasury notes 
we view these high grade securities within our portfolio as having similar market risk characteristics 
principal amounts expected to mature are million  million  million and million during   and  respectively 
these include investments totaling million in federal agency notes that are callable subjecting us to interest rate risk on the reinvestment of these securities 
we believe that the impact of any call and resulting reinvestment of proceeds would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and expenses are denominated in united states dollars  however  porex is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the rate of exchange of the united states dollar against the euro 
this exposure arises primarily as a result of translating the results of porex s foreign operations to the united states dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the accounting period 
porex has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date 
foreign currency translation gains losses were million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
we believe that future exchange rate sensitivity related to porex will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
