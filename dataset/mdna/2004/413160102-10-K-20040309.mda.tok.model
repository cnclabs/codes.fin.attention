item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and sells digital video systems and fiber optic systems that enable network operators to provide a range of interactive and advanced digital services that include digital video  vod  high definition television  high speed internet access and telephony 
historically  most of our sales have been derived from sales of digital headend products and fiber optic transmission systems to cable television and satellite operators 
we also derive a small portion of our sales from telephone companies that offer video services to their customers 
before  almost all of our sales were derived directly or indirectly from sales of fiber optic transmission systems to cable television operators 
we also offer digital headend products to enable delivery of digital video  voice and data over satellite and wireless networks and cable systems 
in order to further expand our digital systems capability  harmonic acquired c cube microsystems inc in may  pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement dated october  under the terms of the merger agreement  c cube spun off its semiconductor business as a separate publicly traded company  which was acquired by lsi logic in june c cube merged into harmonic and harmonic therefore acquired c cube s divicom business  which provides encoding products and systems for digital television 
harmonic has been organized into two operating divisions  broadband access networks  or ban  for fiber optic systems and convergent systems  or cs  for digital headend systems 
harmonic s net sales decreased in  in and in although industry capital spending has been and continues to be generally weak as compared to the pre merger levels achieved by harmonic and divicom in and early  we believe that the sequential quarterly sales increases in reflected a firmer industry capital spending environment worldwide which favorably impacted harmonic 
we believe that the improved environment was reflected by an increase of in harmonic s net sales in the second half of as compared with the second half of we believe that this improvement in the industry capital spending environment is  in part  a result of the intensifying competition between cable and satellite operators to offer more channels of digital video and new services  such as vod and high definition television  and an overall improvement in the cable industry capital market 
also  we believe that the improvement in the industry capital spending environment is a result of the completion of previously announced pending business combinations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
in particular  aldelphia communications  which had declared bankruptcy in june  has obtained debtor in possession financing of billion  allowing it to resume certain capital expenditure programs 
in the fourth quarter of  harmonic issued  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
the net proceeds to harmonic were approximately million  which is net of underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million and related legal  accounting  printing and other expenses totaling approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including payment of existing liabilities  research and development  the development or acquisition of new products or technologies  equipment acquisitions  general working capital and operating expenses 
the offering was made pursuant to our registration statement on form s file no 
filed with the sec on march   as amended on april  and as declared effective on april   and the related prospectus supplement filed with the sec on october  our operating results for included a charge to general and administrative expense of approximately million related to the settlement of litigation with power and telephone supply p t in release of all outstanding claims 
these claims arose from the cancellation of purchase orders on p t by one of its end customers in the settlement charge is net of the value of products returned and other costs 
harmonic paid million of the settlement on july  and paid the balance of million on january  our operating results for also included credits to operating expenses in totaling approximately million from the sale of our bankruptcy claims in adelphia communications resulting in the reversal of previously recorded bad debt provisions  credits of million for products sold during the year which had been written down in prior years 

table of contents during  certain of our domestic and international customers had accumulated significant levels of debt and announced reorganizations and financial restructurings  including bankruptcy filings 
in particular  adelphia communications declared bankruptcy in june  and as a result  we recorded only nominal revenue from adelphia since the first quarter of and established a million provision in the second quarter of for probable losses on receivables and deferred costs of sales determined to no longer be recoverable 
adelphia accounted for less than of net sales in the stock prices of other domestic cable companies also came under pressure following the adelphia communications bankruptcy due to concerns about debt levels and capital expenditure requirements for new and expanded services 
we believe that these capital market concerns about the cable industry and the associated pressures on capital spending contributed to the decrease in sales during the second half of compared to the first half of in addition  spending by our domestic satellite customers and european customers was weak in  particularly in the second half of we believe that this was principally because of pending business consolidations  financial restructurings and regulatory issues 
for example  we believe that the regulatory review of the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar depressed spending in  particularly in the second half of during the fourth quarter of the companies ultimately called off the proposed merger due to federal government opposition  and in december  the news corporation ltd 
acquired an indirect controlling interest in hughes electronics  the parent of directv 
as a result of uncertain market conditions and lower sales during the second half of  we implemented a series of cost control measures that included workforce reductions totaling approximately employees during the second half of harmonic recorded severance charges of million during the second half of related to the work force reductions 
this followed a workforce reduction of approximately during for which we recorded severance and other costs of million at the time 
these actions reduced headcount from over at the end of to at the end of in light of our reduced headcount  difficult business conditions  and a weak local commercial real estate market  we reassessed our accrual for the costs of excess facilities and recorded a charge of million during the third quarter of we changed our estimates with regard to the expected timing and amount of sublease income due to the substantial and growing surplus of vacant space in the san francisco bay area 
the excess facilities charge recorded during the third quarter of was for facilities that we no longer occupied  do not intend to occupy  plan to sublease  and followed charges of million recorded for excess facilities in when the initial accruals were established 
the review performed in the third quarter of resulted in the excess facilities liability being decreased by million due to a revision in the assumptions as to the unoccupied portion of a building 
this revision was offset by a correction of straight line rent expense of million as a result of a lease extension on another building 
this lease extension was a condition of leasing three additional buildings at corporate headquarters and resulted in all leases terminating in september because the effect of the correction on any quarter or year was not material to these results of operations and financial position  the non cash adjustment was recorded in the current year 
in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability  which could materially impact our financial position  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
our operating results in also included charges of million for excess and obsolete inventories and million for fixed asset impairment 
the provisions for excess and obsolete inventories resulted from significant reductions in the demand for our products  principally ban division products 
in accordance with our policy  we wrote down inventory levels in excess of our demand forecasts 
historically  a majority of our net sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  sales to comcast accounted for of net sales 
in  sales to charter communications and comcast accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
if comcast  which acquired at t broadband in november  and at t broadband had been combined for all of  total revenues would have been of net sales 
directv and charter communications represented and of net sales in in   and  sales of ban products accounted for approximately   and of net sales  respectively  while cs products accounted for approximately   and of net sales  respectively 

table of contents sales to customers outside of the united states in   and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
a significant portion of international sales are made to distributors and system integrators  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
harmonic often recognizes a significant portion of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures requires harmonic to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of harmonic s accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which we believe have the most significant impact on harmonic s financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  valuation of inventories  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities  assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition harmonic s principal sources of revenue are from product sales  solution sales  services and maintenance contracts 
harmonic recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer 
revenue from product sales  excluding the revenue generated from service related solutions  which are discussed below  is generally recognized upon shipment  or once all applicable criteria have been met 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
revenue on solution sales  which principally consist of and include the design  manufacture  test  integration and installation of equipment to the specifications of harmonic s customers  or acquired from third parties to be integrated 
table of contents with harmonic s products  is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor costs expended to date to anticipated final labor costs  based on current estimates of labor costs to complete the project 
if the estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss is recognized 
harmonic records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on fixed price contracts as accounts receivables unbilled 
revenue from services  which is primarily from maintenance agreements  is generally recognized ratably as the services are performed or based on contractual terms 
the costs associated with services are recognized as incurred 
maintenance services are recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which is typically one year 
the costs associated with these maintenance services are recognized as incurred 
the unrecognized revenue portion of maintenance agreements billed is recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue includes billings in excess of revenue recognized  net of deferred cost of sales  and invoiced amounts remain deferred until applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
our total deferred revenue was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
certain agreements also include multiple deliverables or elements for products  software and or services 
harmonic recognizes revenue from these agreements based on the relative fair value of the products and services as they are delivered 
the determination of the fair value of the elements is based on a number of factors  including the amount charged to other customers for products or services  price lists  or other relevant information 
if an undelivered element is essential to the functionality of the delivered element or required under the terms of the agreement to be delivered concurrently  we defer the revenue on the delivered element until that undelivered element is delivered 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
for certain products where software is more than an incidental  but less than essential component of the hardware  or where software has been identified as a separate element included in a multiple element arrangement  we recognize software license revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and all revenue recognition criteria of sop  other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement  are satisfied 
revenue recognition in each period is dependent on our application of these accounting policies 
if we believe that any of the conditions to recognize revenue has not been met  we defer revenue recognition 
our application of percentage of completion accounting is subject to our estimates of labor costs to complete each project 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results  financial position and cash flows for a particular period could be adversely affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions and historical payment  return and discount experience  as well as for known or expected events 
if there were to be a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness or if actual defaults  returns or discounts were higher than our historical experience  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
at december   our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts totaled million 

table of contents valuation of inventories harmonic states inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales and future demand and market conditions  expected product lifecycles and current inventory levels 
in the event that we adjust our estimates  such as future demand and expected product lifecycles  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected 
impairment of long lived assets we perform an evaluation of the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets whenever we become aware of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate the recoverability of other intangible assets and long lived assets on the basis of undiscounted cash flows from each asset group 
if impairment is indicated  provisions for impairment are determined based on fair value  principally using discounted cash flows 
changes in industry and market conditions or the strategic realignment of our resources could result in an impairment of identified intangibles or long lived assets 
there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
at december   our net balances for goodwill and intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
restructuring costs and accruals for excess facilities for restructuring activities initiated prior to december  we recorded restructuring costs when harmonic committed to an exit plan and significant changes to the exit plan were not likely 
to determine our excess facility accruals we estimate expected sublease rental income on each excess facility 
in the event we are unable to achieve expected levels of sublease rental income  we will need to revise our estimate of the liability which could materially impact our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  we follow statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  as discussed under new accounting pronouncements below 
at december   our balances for restructuring costs and excess facilities totaled  and million  respectively 
assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation harmonic records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
based on harmonic s review of the complaints filed in the securities class action and other pending litigation  harmonic believes that it either has meritorious defenses with respect to those actions and claims or is unable to predict the impact of an adverse action and  accordingly  no loss contingencies have been accrued 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  operating results and cash flows 
accounting for income taxes in preparation of our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current tax exposures and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
based on our judgment that the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is not assured  we established a valuation allowance of million in which was increased to million in and to million in at december  we have fully reserved for our net deferred tax assets related to temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected

the decrease in the ban division net sales in compared to was due to reduced capital spending by select cable operators  in particular charter communications and adelphia communications  during the first half of we believe this reduced spending was caused by a tightening of the financial markets  and capital markets concerns about the cable industry in the aftermath of the adelphia bankruptcy filing 

table of contents the cs division decrease in compared to was principally attributable to significantly lower sales of encoders to domestic satellite customers 
we believe these lower net sales were due  in part  to purchasing delays created by the uncertainty caused by the regulatory review of the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar which was ultimately called off in the fourth quarter of the lower sales to satellite customers were partially offset by higher sales of the narrowcast services gateway  or nsg  for vod deployments to cable operators

table of contents on november   harmonic completed a public offering of million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds were approximately million  which is net of underwriters fees of million  and related legal  accounting  printing and other expenses totaling approximately million 
in connection with this offering  the underwriters exercised their option to purchase million additional shares of common stock at per share on november  to cover over allotments which resulted in additional net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including payment of existing liabilities  research and development  the development or acquisition of new products or technologies  equipment acquisitions  general working capital and operating expenses 
under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
as of december   approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remain outstanding and are included in accrued liabilities 
harmonic expects to negotiate final settlement and make payment of these obligations to a variety of taxing authorities or to lsi logic during to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amount provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the merger agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
accordingly  we expect a significant reduction in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during in the event these liabilities are more than million  lsi is obligated to indemnify harmonic for the additional amount 
additions to property  plant and equipment were million during compared to million in and million in the increase in was due primarily to the acquisition of test equipment 
the decrease in was due principally to expenditures during for leasehold improvements and related furniture  fixtures and equipment in connection with relocation of former divicom employees to new facilities in sunnyvale  and the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning software system 
harmonic currently expects capital expenditures to be less than million during harmonic has a bank line of credit facility with silicon valley bank  which provides for borrowings of up to million  including million for equipment under a secured term loan 
this facility  which was amended and restated in december  expires in december  and contains financial and other covenants including the requirement for harmonic to maintain unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of credit extensions  of not less than million 
if harmonic is unable to maintain this cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance or satisfy the additional affirmative covenant requirements  harmonic would be in noncompliance with the facility 
in the event of noncompliance by harmonic with the covenants under the facility  silicon valley bank would be entitled to exercise its remedies under the facility which include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable  and disposing of the collateral if obligations were not repaid 
at december   harmonic was in compliance with the covenants under this line of credit facility 
the december amendment resulted in the company paying a fee of approximately thousand and requiring payment of approximately thousand of additional fees if the company does not maintain an unrestricted deposit of million with the bank 
future borrowings pursuant to the line bear interest at the bank s prime rate or prime plus prime rate plus for equipment borrowings depending upon the company s total cash position and previous six months revenue 
borrowings are payable monthly and are collateralized by all of harmonic s assets 
as of december   million was outstanding under the equipment term loan portion of this facility of which million was borrowed during the term loan is payable monthly  including principal and interest at per annum on outstanding borrowings as of december  and matures at various dates through january other than standby letters of credit and guarantees  there were no other outstanding borrowings or commitments under the line of credit facility as of december  as of december   harmonic s bank line of credit facility contained financial and other covenants including a minimum cash covenant established in the november modification which required the company to maintain at least of its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with the bank

harmonic indemnifies some of its suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees 
there have been no claims for indemnification and  accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions at december  harmonic s cash and investment balances increased million in the fourth quarter of after decreasing million through the first three quarters of we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including the proceeds from the stock offering we completed in the fourth quarter of  and our bank line of credit will satisfy our requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the final settlement and payment of c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our expectations or estimates change or prove inaccurate  or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
the completed stock offering in the fourth quarter of was part of a registration statement on form s declared effective by the sec in april the form s registration statement remains effective and harmonic continues to have the ability to use the registration statement to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time  up to an aggregate of approximately million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
in addition  from time to time  we review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty surrounding the ongoing us war on terrorism  as well as conditions in capital markets and the cable and satellite industries

table of contents factors that may affect future results of operations we depend on cable and satellite industry capital spending for a substantial portion of our revenue and any decrease or delay in capital spending in these industries would negatively impact our resources  operating results and financial condition and cash flows 
prior to the merger with c cube microsystems inc  or c cube  in may  almost all of harmonic s historic sales had been derived from sales to cable television operators and we expect these sales to constitute a significant portion of net sales for the foreseeable future 
almost all of the divicom business historic sales had been derived from sales to satellite operators  telephone companies and cable operators 
demand for our products will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable television operators  satellite operators  broadcasters and telephone companies for constructing and upgrading of their systems 
these capital spending patterns are dependent on a variety of factors  including access to financing  annual budget cycles  the impact of industry consolidation  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation of telecommunications and television broadcasting  overall demand for communication services and the acceptance of new video  voice and data services  evolving industry standards and network architectures  competitive pressures  including pricing pressures  discretionary customer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
in the past  specific factors contributing to reduced capital spending have included uncertainty related to development of digital video and cable modem industry standards  delays associated with the evaluation of new services and system architectures by many cable television operators  emphasis on generating revenue from existing customers by cable television operators instead of new construction or network upgrades  proposed business combinations by our customers and regulatory review thereof  economic and financial conditions in domestic and international markets  and bankruptcies and financial restructuring of major customers 
the prolonged economic recession  the financial difficulties of certain of our customers and changes in our customers deployment plans adversely affected our business in the latter part of  throughout and in the first half of two of our major domestic customers  adelphia communications and winfirst  declared bankruptcy during the first half of  while ntl  a major international customer  emerged from bankruptcy in furthermore  we believe that our net sales to satellite customers were adversely affected by the uncertainty related to the prolonged regulatory review of the 
table of contents proposed acquisition of directv by echostar in these events  coupled with uncertain and volatile capital markets  also pressured the market values of domestic cable operators and restricted their access to capital 
this reduced access to funding for new and existing customers caused delays in the timing and scale of deployments of our equipment and also resulted in the postponement or cancellation of certain projects by our customers 
several customers also canceled new projects or delayed new orders to allow them to reduce inventory levels that were in excess of their deployment requirements 
we believe that these factors contributed to decreased net sales in both our cs division and our ban division during the second half of and the first half of compared to the first half of we believe that the financial condition of many of our customers has stabilized or improved  and our net sales increased sequentially in the second  third and fourth quarters of however  despite the improvement  our quarterly net sales during these quarters were lower than the first and second quarters of  and european spending remains generally weak 
furthermore  another economic downturn or other factors could cause additional financial difficulties among our customers  and customers whose financial condition has stabilized may not purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past 
continued financial difficulties among our customers would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
also  the news corporation ltd 
recently acquired an indirect controlling interest in hughes electronics  the parent company of directv 
we cannot currently predict the impact of the news corporation ltd 
s control of directv on our future sales 
furthermore  comcast  our largest customer  recently announced a bid for the walt disney company  and we cannot predict the impact of this bid on our net sales to comcast 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our net sales growth will continue 
major us cable operators have indicated that the imminent completion of major network upgrades  which involve significant labor and construction costs  will lead to lower capital expenditures in the future 
if our product portfolio and product development plans do not position us well to capture an increased portion of the capital spending of us cable operators  our revenue may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
the loss of any key customer would have a negative effect on our business 
historically  a majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers  and due in part to the consolidation of ownership of cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems  we expect this customer concentration to continue in the foreseeable future 
sales to our ten largest customers in   and accounted for approximately  and of net sales  respectively 
although we are attempting to broaden our customer base by penetrating new markets such as the telecommunications and broadcast markets and expand internationally  we expect to see continuing industry consolidation and customer concentration due in part to the significant capital costs of constructing broadband networks 
for example  comcast acquired at t broadband in november  thereby creating the largest us cable operator  reaching approximately million subscribers 
in the dbs segment  the news corporation ltd 
recently acquired an indirect controlling interest in hughes electronics  the parent company of directv 
in addition  financial restructurings of companies such as adelphia communications and several european operators may lead to further industry consolidation 
in  sales to comcast accounted for of net sales 
in  sales to charter communications and comcast accounted for and of net sales 
if comcast and at t broadband had been combined for all of  total revenues would have been of net sales 
comcast recently announced a bid for the walt disney company  and we cannot predict what effect this bid will have on our net sales to comcast 
the loss of comcast or any other significant customer or any reduction in orders by comcast or any significant customer  or our failure to qualify our products with a significant customer could adversely affect our business  operating results and liquidity 
in this regard sales to charter communications were significantly lower in than in  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  as they have significantly reduced capital spending 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would harm our business 

table of contents our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and a quarterly basis  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level and timing of capital spending of our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  the timing and amount of orders  especially from significant customers  the timing of revenue from systems contracts which may span several quarters  competitive market conditions  including pricing actions by our competitors  seasonality  with fewer construction and upgrade projects typically occurring in winter months and otherwise being affected by inclement weather  our unpredictable sales cycles  new product introductions by our competitors or by us  changes in domestic and international regulatory environments  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  subassemblies and modules  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of our products sold  our development of custom products and software  the level of international sales  and economic and financial conditions specific to the cable and satellite industries  and general economic conditions 
for example  the timing of deployment of our equipment can be subject to a number of other risks  including the availability of skilled engineering and technical personnel  the availability of other equipment such as digital set top boxes  and the need for local franchise and licensing approvals 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
as a result of all these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
in this regard  due to lower than expected sales in several quarters during and  and during the third quarter of and the first quarter of  we failed to meet our internal expectations  as well as the expectations of securities analysts and investors  and the price of our common stock declined  in some cases significantly 

table of contents if sales forecasted for a particular period are not realized in that period due to the unpredictable sales cycles of our products  our operating results for that period will be harmed 
the sales cycles of many of our products  particularly our newer products and products sold internationally  are typically unpredictable and usually involve a significant technical evaluation  a commitment of capital and other resources by cable  satellite  and other network operators  time required to engineer the deployment of new technologies or new broadband services  testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations  and test marketing of new services with subscribers 
for these and other reasons  our sales cycles generally last three to six months  but can last up to months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could be substantially lower than anticipated 
as a result of the merger with c cube  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from solution contracts that include a combination of product sales as well as design  installation and integration services 
revenue forecasts for solution contracts are based on the estimated timing of the design  installation and integration of projects 
because the solution contracts generally span several quarters and revenue recognition is based on progress under the contract  the timing of revenue is difficult to predict and could result in lower than expected revenue in any particular quarter 
we depend on our international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our operating results 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and  of net sales  respectively  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our contract manufacturing occurs overseas 
our international operations  the international operations of our contract manufacturer and our efforts to increase sales in international markets  are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
certain of our international customers have accumulated significant levels of debt and have announced during the past three years  reorganizations and financial restructurings  including bankruptcy filings 
even if these restructurings are completed  we cannot assure you that these customers will be in a position to purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past 

table of contents while our international sales and operating expenses have typically been denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
following implementation of the euro in january  a higher portion of our european business is denominated in euros  which may subject us to increased foreign currency risk 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
furthermore  payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
unpredictable sales cycles could cause us to fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts and investors for any given period 
in addition  foreign markets may not develop in the future 
if demand for our products increases more quickly than we expect  we may be unable to meet our customers requirements 
our net sales increased sequentially in the second  third and fourth quarters of if demand for our products continues to increase  the difficulty of accurately forecasting our customers requirements and meeting these requirements will increase 
forecasting to meet customers needs is particularly difficult in connection with newer products 
our ability to meet customer demand depends significantly on the availability of components and other materials as well as the ability of our contract manufacturers to scale their production 
from time to time  we assess our relationship with our contract manufacturers 
changes in these relationships  or reallocating manufacturing to new or existing contract manufacturers  could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers requirements in a timely manner  if at all  and could create operating inefficiencies 
furthermore  we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources 
our ability to meet customer requirements depends in part on our ability to obtain a sufficient number of these materials in a timely fashion 
also  in recent years  in response to lower net sales and the prolonged economic recession  we significantly reduced our headcount and other expenses 
as a result  we may be unable to respond to customer demand that increases more quickly than we expect 
if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  our net sales would be adversely affected and we may lose business 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly management personnel  can be intense 
in order to manage our growth  we must be successful in addressing management succession issues and attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we must successfully manage transition and replacement issues that may result from the departure or retirement of members of our senior management 
we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high caliber personnel  in addition to attracting new personnel 
competition for qualified management  technical and other personnel can be intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we generally do not have employment contracts or non competition agreements with any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly senior management and engineers and other technical personnel  could negatively affect our business 
we face risks associated with having important facilities and resources located in israel 
harmonic maintains a facility in caesarea in the state of israel with a total of approximately employees as of december   or approximately of our workforce 
the employees at this facility consist principally of research and development personnel involved in development of certain products for the cs division 
in addition  we have pilot production capabilities at this facility consisting of procurement of subassemblies and modules from israeli subcontractors and final assembly and test operations 
accordingly  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel  and any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade 
table of contents between israel and its trading partners could significantly harm our business 
the september terrorist attacks  the ongoing us war on terrorism and the escalation of terrorist attacks and hostilities within israel have heightened these risks 
we cannot assure you that the protraction or escalation of current tensions in the middle east will not adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  most of our employees in israel are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and several have been called for active military duty recently 
we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on harmonic in the future 
pending business combinations and other financial and regulatory issues among our customers could adversely affect our business 
the telecommunications industry has been particularly impacted by the prolonged economic recession  adverse conditions in capital markets and financial difficulties in both the service and equipment sectors  including bankruptcies 
although large telecommunications service providers such as worldcom now mci and troubled data and voice oriented start ups have not been traditional customers of harmonic  the cable  satellite and broadcast sectors have experienced significant financial problems 
many of our domestic and international customers have accumulated significant levels of debt and have announced reorganizations and financial restructurings during the past two years  including bankruptcy filings 
in particular  adelphia communications  a major domestic cable operator  declared bankruptcy in june the stock prices of other domestic cable companies came under pressure following the adelphia bankruptcy due to concerns about debt levels and capital expenditure requirements for new and expanded services  thereby making the raising of capital more difficult and expensive 
new operators  such as rcn and winfirst  also had difficulty in accessing capital markets 
winfirst subsequently filed for bankruptcy 
in europe  rapid consolidation of the cable industry through acquisition also led to significant levels of debt at the major msos  and companies such as ntl and upc commenced bankruptcy proceedings 
european digital broadcasters  such as itv digital  kirsch and quiero  have also filed for protection from creditors 
while the capital market concerns about the domestic cable industry have eased since the summer of  market conditions remain difficult and capital spending plans are generally constrained 
it is likely that further industry restructuring will take place via mergers or spin offs  such as the completed comcast at t broadband transaction and the proposed spin off of time warner cable from time warner 
comcast  our largest customer  recently announced a bid for the walt disney company  and we cannot predict the impact of this bid on our net sales to comcast 
also  the news corporation ltd  in december  acquired an indirect controlling interest in hughes electronics  the parent company of directv 
this transaction followed regulatory opposition to the proposed acquisition of directv by echostar 
we cannot currently predict the impact of the news corporation ltd 
control of directv on our future sales 
we believe that uncertainty during regarding the proposed directv and echostar merger adversely affected capital spending by both of these parties as well as other customers 
in addition  further business combinations may occur in the satellite industry  and these further combinations could adversely affect our business 
regulatory issues  financial concerns and business combinations among our customers are likely to significantly affect the industry  its capital spending plans  and our levels of business for the foreseeable future 
we must be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers 
if actual orders are materially lower than the indications we receive from our customers  our ability to manage inventory and expenses may be affected 
if we enter into purchase commitments to acquire materials  or expend resources to manufacture products  and such products are not purchased by our customers  our business and operating results could suffer 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results for the fourth quarter of and in were adversely affected by provisions for excess and obsolete inventories of approximately million 

table of contents the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and many of our competitors are larger and more established 
the markets for cable television fiber optics systems and digital video broadcasting systems are extremely competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change and declining average selling prices 
pressure on average selling prices has been particularly severe during the recent economic downturn as equipment suppliers compete aggressively for customers reduced capital spending 
harmonic s competitors in the cable television fiber optics systems business include corporations such as c cor 
net  motorola  and scientific atlanta 
in the digital and video broadcasting systems business  we compete broadly with vertically integrated system suppliers including motorola  scientific atlanta  tandberg television and thomson multimedia  and in certain product lines with cisco and a number of smaller companies 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than harmonic 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in these markets 
they often have broader product lines and market focus and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market 
in addition  many of our competitors have been in operation longer than we have and therefore have more long standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future  which may harm our business 
if any of our competitors products or technologies were to become the industry standard  our business could be seriously harmed 
for example  us cable operators have to date mostly purchased proprietary digital systems from motorola and scientific atlanta 
while certain operators have made limited purchases of the open systems provided by harmonic  we cannot assure you that our digital products will find broad market acceptance with us cable operators 
in addition  companies that have historically not had a large presence in the broadband communications equipment market have begun recently to expand their market share through mergers and acquisitions 
the continued consolidation of our competitors could have a significant negative impact on us 
further  our competitors  particularly competitors of our digital and video broadcasting systems business  may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or which may require us to lower our selling prices resulting in lower gross margins 
broadband communications markets are characterized by rapid technological change 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature  making it difficult to accurately predict the markets future growth rates  sizes or technological directions 
in view of the evolving nature of these markets  it is possible that cable television operators  telephone companies or other suppliers of broadband wireless and satellite services will decide to adopt alternative architectures or technologies that are incompatible with our current or future products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that incorporate or are compatible with these new architectures or technologies  our business will suffer 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
broadband communications markets are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products if our products are not cost effective  are not brought to market in a timely manner  are not in accordance with evolving industry standards and architectures  or fail to achieve market acceptance  or are ahead of the market 

table of contents also  to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements when necessary could limit our ability to develop and market new products and  accordingly  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources  and we are increasingly dependent on contract manufacturers 
many components  subassemblies and modules necessary for the manufacture or integration of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers  particularly foreign suppliers  and our increased reliance on subcontractors since the merger with c cube involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  subassemblies or modules and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components  subassemblies or modules 
in particular  certain optical components have in the past been in short supply and are available only from a small number of suppliers  including sole source suppliers 
while we expend resources to qualify additional optical component sources  consolidation of suppliers in the industry and the small number of viable alternatives have limited the results of these efforts 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers 
managing our supplier and contractor relationships is particularly difficult during time periods in which we introduce new products and during time periods in which demand for our products is increasing  especially if demand increases more quickly than we expect 
furthermore  from time to time we assess our relationship with our contract manufacturers 
in late  we entered into a three year agreement with plexus services corp 
as our primary contract manufacturer 
the transition of our manufacturing requirements from certain current contract manufacturers to plexus is in progress 
we plan to complete the transition during the second quarter of difficulties in managing relationships with current contract manufacturers  or problems encountered by plexus or harmonic in completing the transition  could impede our ability to meet our customers requirements and adversely affect our operating results 
an inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business 
we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of certain components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we have in the past and in the future may be subject to risk of excess and obsolete inventories  which could harm our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results from the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of were adversely affected by excess and obsolete inventory charges of approximately million 
we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
we have generated substantial operating losses since we began operations in june the extent of our future losses and the timing of potential profitability are highly uncertain  and we may never achieve sustained profitable operations 
we have been engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of a variety of broadband products since inception  which has required  and will continue to require  significant research and development expenditures 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of billion 
although we were profitable in the fourth quarter of  we may not sustain this profitability 
these losses  among other things  have had and may have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital 
we believe that the proceeds of the stock offering we completed in november  with our existing liquidity sources  will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the final settlement and payment of c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our expectations are incorrect  to fund our operations  to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
the stock offering we completed in november related to a registration statement on form s declared effective by the sec in april this registration statement will continue to allow harmonic to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time  up to an aggregate of approximately million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
our ability to raise funds may 
table of contents be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to harmonic  as well as factors beyond our control  including conditions in capital markets and the cable  telecom and satellite industries 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  from time to time  we review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings  enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence 
any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital to finance the acquisition and related expenses as well as to integrate operations following a transaction  and could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
we may raise additional financing through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we will not be able to continue developing our products 
we need to effectively manage our operations and the cyclical nature of our business 
the cyclical nature of our business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our personnel  management and other resources 
this strain has been exacerbated by the acquisition of divicom and the subsequent loss of numerous employees  including senior management 
in addition  we reduced our work force by approximately between december  and december  due to reduced industry spending and demand for our products 
if demand for products increases significantly  we may need to increase our headcount 
our ability to manage our business effectively in the future  including any future growth  will require us to train  motivate and manage our employees successfully  to attract and integrate new employees into our overall operations  to retain key employees and to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
we are incurring additional costs and devoting more management resources to comply with increasing regulation of corporate governance and disclosure 
we are spending an increased amount of management time and external resources to understand and comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules 
devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities 
moreover  we may not be able to comply with these new rules and regulations on a timely basis 
recent and proposed regulations related to equity compensation could adversely affect earnings  affect our ability to raise capital and affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
since our inception  we have used stock options as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that our stock option plans are an essential tool to link the long term interests of stockholders and employees  especially executive management  and serve to motivate management to make decisions that will  in the long run  give the best returns to stockholders 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has announced that it will propose changes to us gaap that  if implemented  would require us to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants 
this pending regulation would negatively impact our earnings and could affect our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms 
in addition  new regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 

table of contents we are liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities  including tax liabilities resulting from the spin off of its semiconductor business 
under the terms of the merger agreement with c cube  harmonic is generally liable for c cube s pre merger tax liabilities 
approximately million of pre merger tax liabilities remain outstanding and are included in accrued liabilities 
we are working with lsi logic  which acquired c cube s spun off semiconductor business in june and assumed its obligations  to develop an approach to settle these obligations  a process which has been underway since the merger in these liabilities represent estimates of c cube s pre merger tax obligations to various tax authorities in countries 
we are currently in discussions with tax authorities in of these countries  but none of these estimates has yet been finalized 
harmonic expects to pay at least million of these tax obligations during the second quarter of  but is unable to predict when the remaining tax obligations will be paid  or in what amount 
the full amount of the estimated obligation has been classified as a current liability 
to the extent that these obligations are finally settled for less than the amounts provided  harmonic is required  under the terms of the merger agreement  to refund the difference to lsi logic 
conversely  if the settlements are more than the million pre merger tax liability  lsi logic is obligated to reimburse harmonic 
the merger agreement stipulates that harmonic will be indemnified by the spun off semiconductor business if the cash reserves are not sufficient to satisfy all of c cube s tax liabilities for periods prior to the merger 
if for any reason  the spun off semiconductor business does not have sufficient cash to pay such taxes  or if there are additional taxes due with respect to the non semiconductor business and harmonic cannot be indemnified by lsi logic  harmonic generally will remain liable  and such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be subject to risks associated with other acquisitions 
we have made  continue to consider making and may make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we enter into acquisition transactions  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies key personnel and operations or integrating the acquired technology or products into ours 
we also may face challenges in achieving the strategic objectives  cost savings or other benefits from a proposed acquisition and difficulties in expanding our management information systems to accommodate the acquired business 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and significantly increase our expenses 
moreover  our operating results may suffer because of acquisition related expenses  amortization of intangible assets and impairment of acquired goodwill or intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  or to provide for additional working capital requirements  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
cessation of the development and production of video encoding chips by c cube s spun off semiconductor business may adversely impact us 
the divicom business and c cube semiconductor business collaborated on the production and development of two video encoding microelectronic chips prior to the merger 
in connection with the merger  harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business entered into a contractual relationship under which harmonic will have access to certain of the spun off semiconductor business technologies and products which the divicom business previously depended for its product and service offerings 
the spun off semiconductor business is the sole supplier of these chips to harmonic 
several of these products continue to be important to our business  and we have incorporated these chips into additional products that we have developed 
however  under the contractual relationships between harmonic and the spun off semiconductor business  which was acquired by lsi logic in june  the semiconductor business does not have a firm commitment to continue the development of video encoding microelectronic chips 
as a result  the semiconductor business may choose not to continue future development of the chips for any reason 
the semiconductor business may also encounter in the future technological difficulties in the production and development of the chips 
if the spun off semiconductor business is not 
table of contents able to or does not sustain its development and production efforts in this area our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be harmed 
also  this agreement expires in october our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
we currently hold issued united states patents and issued foreign patents  and have a number of patent applications pending 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  licensing arrangements  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures  we cannot assure you that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
we believe that patents and patent applications are not currently significant to our business  and investors therefore should not rely on our patent portfolio to give us a competitive advantage over others in our industry 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our personnel into new and enhanced products 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  we have taken in the past  and may take in the future  legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
in order to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
although many companies are often willing to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  we cannot assure you that such agreements will be negotiated on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  when necessary  could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could cause our business to suffer 
we or our customers may face intellectual property infringement claims from third parties 
harmonic s industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  leading companies in the telecommunications industry have extensive patent portfolios 
from time to time  third parties  including these leading companies  have asserted and may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights against us or our customers 
indeed  a number of third parties  including leading companies  have asserted patent rights to technologies that are important to us 
on july   stanford university and litton systems filed a complaint in us district court for the central district of california alleging that optical fiber amplifiers incorporated into certain of harmonic s products infringe us patent no 
 this patent expired in september the complaint seeks injunctive relief  royalties and damages 
harmonic has not been served in the case 
harmonic is currently evaluating its position with respect to this patent and has engaged in discussions with the plaintiff regarding potential settlement of the matter 
at this time  harmonic is unable to determine whether harmonic will be able to settle this matter on reasonable terms or at all  nor can harmonic predict the impact of an adverse outcome of this litigation if harmonic elects to defend against it 
consequently  harmonic has made no provision in its financial statements for the outcome of a negotiated settlement or an unfavorable verdict in litigation 
an unfavorable outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on harmonic s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents our suppliers and customers may receive similar claims 
we have agreed to indemnify some of our suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of this indemnity varies  but  in some instances  includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorney s fees 
in this regard  since december  we have been in communication with several of harmonic s customers who have been contacted by one of these leading companies that believes certain of our products require a license under a number of their patents 
we currently are reviewing the identified patents to examine whether we consider a license necessary 
while it is our understanding that the third party is willing to grant our customers a non exclusive license under the identified patents  there can be no assurance that the terms of any offered license would be acceptable to our customers or that failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license would not cause our operating results to be materially adversely affected 
we are the subject of securities class action claims and other litigation which  if adversely determined  could harm our business and operating results

a derivative action purporting to be on behalf of harmonic was filed against its then current directors in the superior court for the county of santa clara on september  harmonic also was named as a nominal defendant 
the complaint is based on allegations similar to those found in the securities class action and claims that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by  among other things  causing harmonic to violate federal securities laws 
the derivative action was removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california on september  all deadlines in this action were stayed pending resolution of the motions to dismiss the securities class action 
on july   the court approved the parties stipulation to dismiss this derivative action without prejudice and to toll the applicable limitations period 
the limitations period is tolled until fourteen days after defendants provide plaintiff with a copy of the mandate issued by the ninth court in the securities action or either party provides written notice of termination of the tolling period  whichever is first 
a second derivative action purporting to be on behalf of harmonic was filed in the superior court for the county of santa clara on may  it alleges facts similar to those previously alleged in the securities class action and the federal derivative action

although the parties initially agreed in principle to a dismissal without prejudice on similar terms as in the federal derivative action  after further discussion  the parties decided that the stay currently in place suffices to protect their respective interests 
based on its review of the complaints filed in the securities class action  harmonic believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously 
there can be no assurance  however  that harmonic will prevail 
no estimate can be made of the possible range of loss associated with the resolution of this contingency and accordingly  harmonic has not recorded a liability 
an unfavorable outcome of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on harmonic s business  operating results  financial position and cash flows

the terrorist attacks of and the ongoing threat of terrorism have created great uncertainty and may continue to harm our business 
current conditions in the us and global economies are uncertain 
the terrorist attacks in created many economic and political uncertainties that have severely impacted the global economy 
we experienced a further decline in demand for our products after the attacks 
the long term effects of the attacks  the situation in iraq and the ongoing war on terrorism on our business and on the global economy remain unknown 
moreover  the potential for future terrorist attacks has created additional uncertainty and makes it difficult to estimate how quickly the us and other economies will recover and our business will improve 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  particularly in recent years  and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above their purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and any electrical and natural gas crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
we rely on a continuous power supply for manufacturing and to conduct our business operations 
interruptions in electrical power supplies in california in the early part of could recur in the future 
in addition  the cost of electricity and natural gas has risen significantly 
power outages could disrupt our manufacturing and business operations and those of many of our suppliers  and could cause us to fail to meet production schedules and commitments to customers and other third parties 
any disruption to our operations or those of our suppliers could result in damage to our current and prospective business relationships and could result in lost revenue and additional expenses  thereby harming our business and operating results 

table of contents some anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan  as well as provisions of delaware law  could impair a takeover attempt 
harmonic has provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws  each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by the harmonic board of directors 
these include provisions authorizing blank check preferred stock  which could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to harmonic common stock  limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  directors and officers  limiting the ability of harmonic stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings  requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of harmonic stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to the harmonic board of directors  controlling the procedures for conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings  and providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings 
these provisions  alone or together  could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control or management of harmonic 
in addition  harmonic has adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of harmonic  and we believe these rights will help harmonic s negotiations with any potential acquirers 
however  if the board of directors believes that a particular acquisition is undesirable  the rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging that acquisition 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire harmonic on terms or in a manner not approved by the harmonic board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon redemption of the rights 
as a delaware corporation  harmonic also is subject to provisions of delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents some stockholders holding more than of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  our stockholder rights plan or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for harmonic stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of harmonic common stock  and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for harmonic common stock

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the operating results  financial position  or liquidity of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries 
foreign currency exchange risk harmonic has a number of international subsidiaries each of whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were approximately of total net sales in in addition  the company has various international branch offices which provide sales support and systems integration services 
while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of local currencies would not harm harmonic s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to harmonic s investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to harmonic s borrowings under its bank line of credit facility
