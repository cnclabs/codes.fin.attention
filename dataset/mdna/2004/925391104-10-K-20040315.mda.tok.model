item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview vesta conducts business in three areas of the personal insurance industry standard property and casualty insurance  non standard automobile insurance  and life insurance 
our consolidated revenue is derived principally from risk bearing premiums  policy fees  commissions and fees  investment income and investment gains and losses 
our consolidated expenses consist primarily of payments for claims and expenses associated with underwriting activities  agents commissions and operations 
we report financial information according to five business segments standard property casualty insurance  non standard agency  non standard underwriting  life insurance  and corporate and other 
since  we have discontinued a number of business lines 
we have segregated the reporting for these discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
since  we have pursued a strategy to grow our market share in certain capacity restrained niche markets in the standard property casualty business  to exit certain states in which current results and projected future results do not fit our overall profitability strategy and to participate in profitable opportunities in other industry segments such as the non standard automobile business and the life insurance business 
while we have experienced significant and profitable growth in various personal lines business since  we have also experienced significant declines in our property and casualty subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus during the same period 
these declines in capital and surplus are primarily attributable to lower than expected arbitration awards and changes in estimates of disputed reinsurance recoverable balances  reserve strengthening in our discontinued commercial and assumed reinsurance segments and increased policy acquisitions costs associated with significant premium growth 
this decline in statutory surplus coupled with significant growth in premium written is the primary reason that am best company adjusted the financial strength ratings of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries from b very good to b fair in march of since the am best rating action  we have not experienced a significant negative impact from our operations 
however  the adjustment could lead to significant deterioration in selected portions of our standard property and casualty premium volume and adversely impact the financial results of this segment going forward  the degree to which management is unable to quantify 
in an effort to strengthen our capital position  we began a capital evaluation in march of the capital evaluation included an analysis of the possible divestiture of certain of our businesses  including our life and health operations and elements of our property casualty operations 
the capital evaluation resulted in the following significant events affecting our results of operation and financial condition during the increased utilization of quota share reinsurance for our standard property casualty operations during  the combination of our non standard auto insurance operations with our non standard agency operations in an effort to i seek separate financial strength ratings for our non standard auto underwriting operations and our standard property casualty operations and ii facilitate an initial public offering of our combined non standard auto underwriting and agency operations  the sale of our health insurance operations  the anticipated sale of our life insurance operations in march standard property casualty and non standard underwriting the financial results of our property casualty underwriting activities including our standard property casualty segment and the non standard underwriting segment primarily depend upon three variables the amount of premiums and policy fees we collect  which is dependent upon rates and volume  the costs we incur to adjust and pay claims submitted by individuals we have insured  and the expenses we incur for policy acquisition and to operate our insurance companies 
subject to competitive and market trends and regulatory approval  premium rates are generally within our control  and we continuously monitor and seek to adjust rates as appropriate 
during  we implemented six rate increases in our standard automobile business line in the states of north carolina  ohio  west virginia and pennsylvania  which represented a weighted average premium increase of approximately on actual gross written premiums during of million 
during  we also implemented rate increases in our standard residential property line in the states of west virginia  ohio  pennsylvania  
table of contents tennessee  south carolina  arizona  florida and new york which represented a weighted average premium increase of approximately on actual gross written premiums during of million 
in regard to our non standard underwriting segment  our rate adjustments will result in a weighted average overall maintenance of rate adequacy  which is reflective of our favorable loss ratio experience 
the degree to which the company is able to realize the positive impact from these rate increases is contingent upon the degree to which we can sustain current net written premium levels 
decreased written premium levels due to our surplus constraints  competition  or further increases in our utilization of reinsurance would reduce the impact of these rate increases 
furthermore  the impact of these rate increases may be reduced through future rate reductions enacted by state regulatory agencies 
the costs we incur to adjust and pay claims  known as loss and loss adjustment expenses  are largely beyond our control and depend primarily upon the frequency and or severity of claims made by our policyholders 
one measure of performance in the insurance industry is the loss ratio  which is the ratio of i the sum of loss and loss adjustment expenses  to ii the sum of earned premiums and policy fees 
our loss ratio will generally increase or decrease according to the frequency and or severity of claims made by our policyholders 
another key performance measure for insurance companies is the combined ratio 
the combined ratio compares i the sum of loss  loss adjustment expenses  operating expenses and policy acquisition expenses  to ii total earned premiums and policy fees 
a combined ratio of less than indicates underwriting profitability  without regard to investment income earned from investing the premium received 
our property and casualty insurance companies also earn investment income by collecting and investing premiums in advance of paying claims 
in addition to investing operating cash flow  these insurance companies invest funds and earn investment income related to the required statutory surplus that we maintain in our insurance companies to support the premium that we underwrite 
we report the investment income and realized investment security gains or losses generated from these activities of our property and casualty insurance companies in our corporate and other segment 
non standard agency the financial results of our agency activities primarily depend upon the amount of fees and commissions we can collect from the sale of insurance products and the expenses we incur to conduct our day to day operations 
although we expect the minimum commissions and policy fees that we earn under a typical agency contract to be relatively stable  we expect to earn a substantial amount of additional profit sharing commissions in excess of the contractual minimums 
our underwriting agencies predominantly design  distribute and service policies issued by our insurance companies 
during  our underwriting agencies also administered the policies of one unaffiliated non standard personal automobile insurance company 
in the future  these underwriting agencies may provide services to additional unaffiliated insurance companies in order to ensure continuity and sufficient underwriting product and capacity for our distribution channels regardless of hard or soft cycles 
our underwriting agencies appoint our retail agencies and independent agencies to distribute insurance policies to individual customers 
in the year ended december   our retail stores were responsible for of the gross written premiums produced by our underwriting agencies 
in the year ended december   our underwriting agencies utilized approximately  independent agencies to sell the policies that they administer and these independent agencies were responsible for of the gross written premiums produced by our underwriting agencies 
our retail stores predominately sell non standard personal automobile insurance policies issued by our insurance companies and administered by our underwriting agencies 
approximately of our retail stores commission and fee revenue is paid by us for sales of our non standard personal automobile insurance policies and is therefore eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining of our retail stores commission and fee revenue is generated through sales of non standard personal automobile policies issued by unaffiliated insurance companies as well as through sales of certain other complementary insurance products and ancillary non insurance products and services 

table of contents life insurance the financial results of our life insurance operations primarily depend upon the amount we collect as premium  the amount of investment income earned on invested premium  and the benefits we pay to insureds upon their death 
unlike the standard property casualty segment  we typically hold the premium collected on our life products for many years and invest such premium over a long period of time  making investment income a significant component of revenue that we report in the life segment 
the greatest variable in our revenue in the life segment is the amount of income we can earn on invested assets  which is dependent upon general interest rates and market conditions 
the greatest variable in our expense from period to period is the mortality rate of our insureds  as mortality rates in excess of our actuarially predicted levels will adversely impact financial results in any given period 
corporate and other the financial results of our corporate and other segment reflect other revenue and expenses that are not allocated to any particular segment  including i investment income related to our property casualty underwriting operations  ii corporate interest expense  iii general corporate operating expenses  and iv realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities or the repurchases of our own debt securities at a discount 
in addition to the above mentioned factors  our financial results may also be impacted by weather related events such as hurricanes and tornadoes 
also  our ability to effectively compete in the insurance markets we serve is influenced by the financial strength ratings assigned to our companies by am best 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based upon the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
our financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to apply our accounting policies  particularly in certain critical areas 
we believe the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
recoverability of assets  including reinsurance receivables  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred tax assets and other intangible assets  valuation of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives  valuation of investments  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  recognition of revenue  allocation of purchase price for acquisitions  and evaluation of litigation 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
in  we initially adopted the following accounting standards fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities vies  derivatives implementation group issue no 
b bifurcation of embedded credit derivatives  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
emerging issues task force issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments for a discussion of the accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted  please refer to note a to our consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of assets our financial statements include as assets amounts we either i expect to collect from third parties  particularly reinsurance recoverables  or ii expect to benefit from in future periods  particularly deferred acquisition costs and deferred tax assets 
in establishing these amounts  we have made significant judgments and estimates regarding the ultimate realization of each asset 
specifically  we have made critical assumptions and judgments in establishing assets for reinsurance recoverables on 
table of contents paid losses  deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes 
changes in the assumptions  judgments or estimates we have made with respect to each of these assets would directly impact our financial results and financial condition 
reinsurance recoverable on paid and incurred losses as a matter of practice  we routinely cede risks associated with insurance policies we underwrite to reinsurers pursuant to contractual arrangements 
we obtain reinsurance to provide protection for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses  to stabilize the results of our underwriting activities and to reduce our net liability for individual risks 
we report as assets the estimated reinsurance recoverable on paid losses  including an estimate for losses incurred but not reported  and amounts paid to reinsurers applicable to unexpired terms of policies in force 
in exchange for reinsurance coverage  we pay a portion of the policy premiums we receive to reinsurers who have assumed a specified level of risk pursuant to a reinsurance contract 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of coverage to which it assumes  reinsurance arrangements do not legally discharge the principal insurer from primary liability for the full amount of a policy 
when we determine that a claim for loss made under one of our policies is owed  we initially pay the full amount owed to the insured or the claimant 
subsequently  we seek to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the applicable reinsurance contract 
we record the amounts we expect to receive from reinsurers pursuant to these contracts as assets in our financial statements 
at december   we have recorded million  captioned as reinsurance recoverable on paid losses on our consolidated balance sheet  for our estimate of amounts due vesta from reinsurers for the payment of valid claims 
additionally  at december   we have recorded million  captioned as reinsurance balances receivable on our consolidated balance sheet  for our estimate of amounts due vesta from reinsurers for unpaid losses  and amounts paid to these reinsurers applicable to terms of policies in force 
these amounts reflect the impact of our current reinsurance agreements including the impact from the quota share 
the amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of each reinsurer s obligations pursuant to individual reinsurance contracts between vesta and each reinsurer 
in establishing the balances for reinsurance recoverables and reinsurance receivables  we have made judgments in assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed to us 
in evaluating the credit and financial quality of each reinsurer  we rely upon financial statements  credit reports and other publicly available information applicable to each reinsurer as well as management s experience and industry knowledge 
the company has ceded reserves of million to lumbermens mutual casualty company  a member of the kemper insurance companies  primarily related to long term care obligations under personal injury protection auto policies of the shelby insurance companies originating prior to their acquisition in lumbermens and other members of the kemper insurance companies  which operate under a business pooling arrangement  were assigned an a 
m 
best s rating of d poor on june  the company is closely monitoring the financial condition of lumbermens  which has entered into a voluntary run off plan with the illinois department of insurance 
as of december   no valuation allowance has been recorded related to the ceded reserve receivables from lumbermens 
it is possible that the amounts we recover under reinsurance contracts could be materially less than the amounts we have recorded  which may result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
some reinsurers may dispute our claims under reinsurance contracts  including our calculation of amounts recoverable and may pursue arbitration or litigation over these matters 
during the years and  we have recorded changes in our estimated reinsurance recoverables of approximately million primarily related to several reinsurance arbitrations including nrma insurance ltd  alfa mutual insurance company and dorinco reinsurance company related to our whole account quota share  f g re on behalf of usf g  cigna property and casualty insurance company  hartford reinsurance  and delta re 
changes in our assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to establishing assets for reinsurance recoverables on paid losses and reinsurance balances receivable would materially impact our financial results and financial condition 
for more discussion of reinsurance recoverables and other amounts subject to estimation due to arbitrations with our reinsurers  please refer to notes g and i to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs represent costs we incur in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
deferred policy acquisition costs are primarily comprised of commissions and other costs related to issuing insurance policies  net of amounts received from reinsurers as reimbursements of such costs 
in accordance with gaap  these costs are not expensed in their entirety upon their incurrence as is the case for statutory accounting purposes  rather  they are initially recorded as assets in our financial statements and are subsequently amortized over the life of the insurance policies to which they relate or at a constant rate based upon the present 
table of contents value of the estimated gross profits to be earned from the underlying policies 
this treatment is intended to match the expenses associated with issuing an insurance policy with estimated profits to be earned on the policy over the life of the policy 
at december   we had established million as assets for deferred acquisition costs in our financial statements 
a reduction in recorded deferred policy acquisition costs shall be recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated investment income 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews the components of deferred acquisition costs we have established and assesses their recoverability 
at december   we determined that there was no premium deficiency 
changes in our assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to establishing deferred acquisition costs could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
such changes assessed by management that could negatively impact the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs on an ongoing basis include changes in estimated future loss ratios  changes in projected investment income  reduction of premium rates due to competitive factors or regulatory actions  or changes in our overall expense levels 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations  as well as net operating loss  tax credit and other carryforwards 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and an evaluation of both objective and subjective positive and negative factors 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this evaluation during  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including our past results  the existence of significant cumulative losses in recent years  and our estimate of future taxable income 
while we anticipate being profitable in future periods  the combination of significant cumulative losses in recent years and uncertainty with respect to our ability to achieve sufficient taxable income to fully realize our year end deferred tax asset balances within a reasonable time frame  warrants the recording of a valuation allowance under sfas no 
accordingly  we recorded an additional valuation allowance of million for the year ended december   which represents our net deferred tax asset balance for which corresponding deferred tax liabilities did not offset 
this increase in our valuation allowance  coupled with the million valuation allowance that existed at december  that related to an acquisition made in  resulted in an aggregate deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million as of december  we will continue to review our estimated taxable income in relation to our actual results on an ongoing basis 
in the event that certain planned transactions are consummated or management believes that existing uncertainties regarding our forecasted taxable income are minimized  the existing valuation allowance may be reversed 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in our financial statements  we have recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  which represents the amount by which the price we paid to acquire net assets exceeds the fair value of tangible assets and identified intangibles with definite lives acquired less the fair value of the liabilities assumed 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon management s short and long term projections of future performance for each of our business lines 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to sustain or increase activities in our various business lines 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in changes to recorded asset balances 

table of contents effective january   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  we no longer amortize goodwill on a periodic basis in our consolidated financial statements 
rather  on at least an annual basis  we conduct an evaluation to assess whether the fair value of our reporting units exceeds each reporting units carrying value 
our annual evaluation is performed as of september th 
upon the occurrence of significant events  which could impact the assumptions we use to project future profitability  we update our evaluation of our reporting units 
we evaluate impairment of three reporting units homeowners insurance operations  life insurance companies  and non standard agency operations 
for purposes of applying the provisions of sfas no 
 we compare the aggregate fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if there is any impairment 
as long as the aggregate fair value exceeds the aggregate carrying value for each reporting unit  no impairment is recognized in our financial statements  even if an individual component of a reporting unit would be impaired on a stand alone basis 
for the year ended december   we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for each reporting unit as follows homeowners insurance operations million  life insurance companies million  and non standard auto insurance operations million 
we assess the valuation of goodwill and other indefinite intangibles based upon a the historical financial performance of each unit  b the most recent financial performance of each unit  c management s financial forecast for each reporting unit  d information regarding publicly available financial terms of recent transactions in the insurance industry  and e other publicly available information 
as noted above  our required annual evaluation was performed as of september  based on this evaluation  we concluded that there is no goodwill impairment 
based on the significance of the events that occurred during and subsequent to the fourth quarter  we updated our goodwill evaluation and again we have concluded that there is no goodwill impairment as of december  with respect to all of our reporting units  our ability to achieve forecasts and projected undiscounted cash flows are based upon various assumptions made by management 
there can be no assurance that our actual financial results in the future will not vary materially from the estimates we have used in our assessment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the reader should refer to exhibit of this filing for a summary of the factors we believe present a potential risk to vesta s ability to achieve anticipated future performance 
also  because of uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and business lines  it is possible that forecasts used to support goodwill may change in the future  which could result in additional non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation of investments in accordance with guidelines established by our board of directors  our investment portfolio consists primarily of investment grade  fixed income securities 
at december   our cash and investment portfolio was approximately billion  with consisting of investments in equity securities 
because of the nature of our investments  the fair value of our portfolio is not typically volatile  and the market values of our investments have generally been greater than or equal to their costs 
our investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices  if available 
if quoted prices are not available  fair value is primarily determined based upon management s assessment of the market value of comparable investments 
our determination of fair value also considers various factors including time value and volatility issues  credit quality of the counterparty and existing conditions in the overall financial markets 
from time to time  the carrying values of our investments may be temporarily impaired because of such factors 
we do not adjust the carrying value of any investment unless management determines that its value is other than temporarily impaired 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic concerns warrant such an evaluation 
factors considered by management in determining whether an impairment of an investment security is other than temporary includes the credit quality of the security  the severity of the decrease between the security s cost and market value  the length of time of the security s impairment and the likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the future 
in the event that management determined that a reduction in an investment security s fair value below its costs basis is other than temporary  the security s cost basis is reduced to its fair value and a corresponding realized loss is recorded in our consolidated income statement 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of realized losses for other than temporary impairments of investment securities 
the determination of whether other than temporary impairment has occurred involves significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
changing economic conditions global  regional or related to industries of specific issuers could adversely affect these values 

table of contents at december   included in securities available for sale are the following investments with unrealized losses classified according to the term of the unrealized loss of less than twelve months or twelve months or longer less than months months or longer total description of securities of positions fair value unrealized loss of positions fair value unrealized loss of positions fair value unrealized loss us treasury obligations federal agency obligations corporate bonds debt securities common stock total temporarily impaired securities the unrealized loss approximates of the fair value of the temporarily impaired securities at december  for those securities identified as having temporary impairments for less than twelve months  management noted that the temporary losses are due to recent increases in us treasury yields and are not due to deterioration in credit quality or impairment issues 
during the second half of  year us treasury yields increased 
to 
resulting in a lowering of the market values of these securities 
bonds purchased in the lower interest rate environment of early showed year end unrealized losses that are attributable to changes in overall yields and  in management s opinion  do not represent a permanent impairment issues 
for those securities identified as having temporary impairments of twelve months or more  approximately of these unrealized losses occurred in federal agency mortgage backed securities 
management does not view these losses as being related to credit quality as these bonds are guaranteed by the issuing agency and  with respect to certain securities  by the us government 
it is not expected that the securities would be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
the remaining potential losses over one year are split between investment and non investment grade securities 
a majority of these losses represent securities that are secured by collateral mitigating any impairment risk 
it is not expected that the securities will be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
loss and loss adjustment expenses we maintain property casualty loss reserves to cover the estimated ultimate unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the ultimate liability  but rather utilize actuarial projection techniques commonly used in the insurance industry to develop estimates 
reserve estimates represent managements expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based upon  among other factors  an assessment of facts and circumstances then known  a review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency  and estimates of salvage and subrogation 
for purposes of establishing reserves on risks insured during the most recent year  including interim periods for which there is minimum experience to date  we have used forecasted loss ratios that have been applied to earned premiums during the interim periods 
the determination of such forecasted loss ratios involved significant judgments by management  taking into account the results of the most recent actuarial studies performed  current pricing and underwriting  expected loss and loss adjustment expense trends and other pertinent considerations 
in addition  we monitored and analyzed key loss and loss adjustment expense indicators and trends throughout the year 
these included  but were not limited to  paid losses  newly reported claims and incidents  closed claim activity and other metrics 
at december   we had recorded liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses of million 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves comprise the largest liability and most significant estimate or compilation of estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are subject to significant inherent uncertainties and so there can be no assurance as to whether the actual results will be higher or lower than these estimates 
any adjustments or changes for such differences may be material  especially to our operating results for a period 
as our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are re estimated  changes to those estimates  if any  are recognized through a charge to income in the most recent period presented 

table of contents policy liabilities reserves for investment type contracts are based either on the contract account balance if future benefit payments in excess of the account balance are not guaranteed or on the present value of future benefit payments if such payments are guaranteed 
additions to insurance liabilities are made if it is determined that future cash flows including investment income are insufficient to cover future benefits and expenses 
for investment contracts without mortality risk such as deferred annuities and immediate annuities with benefits paid for a certain period  premium deposits and benefit payments are recorded as increases or decreases in a liability account  rather than as revenue and expense 
we record as revenue any amounts charged against the liability account for the cost of insurance  policy administration  and surrender penalties 
any interest credited to the liability account and any benefit payments which exceed the contract liability account balance are recorded as expenses 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of vesta s annuity reserves are subject to discretionary withdrawal without surrender charges or other adjustments 
reserves for traditional life contracts are generally calculated using the net level premium method  based on assumptions as to mortality  withdrawals  dividends  and investment yields ranging from to 
these assumptions are generally made at the time the contract is issued or at the purchase date 
these assumptions are based on projections from past experience  making allowance for possible unfavorable deviation 
revenue recognition our consolidated revenue is derived principally from premiums  commissions  fees  investment income and investment gains and losses 
premium income  the largest component of our consolidated revenue  is generally recognized on a pro rata basis over the respective period of each property casualty insurance policy 
premium receivables are recorded net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
agency commission income is recognized at the later of the billing or effective date of the related insurance policies  net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations 
at that date  the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds based on an analysis of our historical policy cancellation data and establish reserves accordingly 
premiums on life insurance contracts are recognized as income as they become due 
generally  we consider commission and policy fees earned by our agency activities to be a relatively stable revenue stream 
however  a significant portion of our non standard agency business utilizes profit sharing commissions that enable us to collect  in certain circumstances  commissions and fees in excess of contractual minimums 
profit sharing commissions are recorded when they become probable as determined by our internal actuaries 
changes in assumptions  estimates and judgments we have made concerning the ultimate realization of profit sharing commissions  as well as differences in the frequency and severity of claims by policyholders  could adversely impact our financial results and financial condition 
litigation we are subject to proceedings  arbitrations  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  labor  insurance contracts and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based upon a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
our judgments as to any reserves required in connection with these matters may change in the future because of new developments in each situation or changes in our approach in addressing these matters such as a change in settlement strategy 
for more information concerning litigation and arbitration matters to which we are a party  please refer to item legal proceedings of this report and note g to our consolidated financial statements 
comparison of to for the year ended december   we reported a net loss available to common shareholders of million diluted per share  compared with a net loss available to shareholders of million 
diluted per share reported for the previous year 

table of contents the primary factors that impacted our financial results in were as follows a standard property casualty combined ratio of  which included the recognition of million of losses and loss adjustment expenses related to series of april  hail storms in texas and the southeastern united states  the recognition of a pre tax charge of million related to our whole account quota share and related disputed items 
the recognition of a deferred tax asset valuation charge of million 
reduction in investment income as a result of an overall decline in interest rates and decline in average invested assets  the execution of the quota share effective september  covering our residential property book of business in our continuing states 
reduction in operating expenses as a result of declines in total employees and other cost reduction initiatives  and continued growth in our non standard agency and non standard underwriting business lines resulting from agency acquisitions in and charges to discontinued operations of million  net of tax  related to the divestiture of our health operations  increases to our commercial and assumed reinsurance reserves  and the write off of certain assumed reinsurance receivable balances 
for a depiction of the various components of revenue  expense and financial results for each of our business segments for the years ending december  please refer to note l of our consolidated financial statements 
standard property casualty segment in our standard property casualty segment  we underwrite or sell personal automobile and residential property insurance through approximately  independent insurance sales agencies 
in  the standard property casualty segment generated approximately million in revenue  or approximately of consolidated revenue 
for the year ended december   net premiums written in our standard property casualty lines decreased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
net premiums earned for standard property casualty lines decreased by million  or  in  to million from million in our standard property casualty segment pre tax loss from continuing operations improved from a million loss in to a loss of million loss in the decrease in both net premiums written and net premiums earned was primarily attributable to our reinsurance activity 
effective september   we entered into a quota share agreement on our residential property book of business in our continuing states  excluding texas 
the terms of the quota share include a term of one year  with the option of terminating the treaty on a cut off basis on june   and a sliding scale ceding commission due from to the reinsurers based on net written premiums and the loss performance of the subject book of business 
effective december   we added our residential property book of business in texas to this quota share agreement 
prior to december   the texas residential property book of business was reinsured under the quota share treaty  which expired on november  the impact of the quota share and the quota share on the standard property casualty net premiums written and net premiums earned and policy fees in fiscal year was a reduction of million and million  respectively 
additionally  the continuation of management s initiative to exit certain states georgia  arkansas  illinois  indiana  maryland  north carolina  new mexico  nevada  ohio and virgina  our discontinued states  further decreased net written and net premiums earned in by million and million respectively 
although we do not expect our net written premium will significantly increase in  we have implemented rate increases to address emerging loss trends and to protect our net written premium relative to expenses  or underwriting margin 
during  we implemented six rate increases in our standard automobile business line in the states of north carolina  ohio  west virginia and pennsylvania  which represented a weighted average premium increase of approximately on actual gross written premiums during of million 
during  we also implemented rate increases in our standard residential property line in the states of west virginia  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  south carolina  arizona  florida and new york which represented a weighted average premium increase of approximately on estimated actual gross written premiums of million 

table of contents loss and loss adjustment expenses for standard property casualty lines for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease in loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred was primarily attributable to a million impact resulting from the effects of the quota share and improved underwriting results  offset by increases in catastrophe losses  including the million in loss and loss adjustment expenses resulting from a series of hail storms in texas and the southeastern united states 
for the year ended december   the loss ratio for standard property casualty segment was compared with at december  the decrease in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to improved underwriting performance  including improvements in claim severity for both our homeowners and auto businesses  only partially offset by the aforementioned million catastrophe loss 
for the year ended december   policy acquisition expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million for the same period of the prior year 
policy acquisition expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned decreased to in from in  reflecting the effects of the quota share and a shifting of business concentration to states with lower agent commissions and other policy acquisition expenses 
the quota share treaty include a provisional ceding commission that is higher than that of the quota share agreement 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million from million 
the increase in operating expenses is primarily attributed to a million increase in expenses related to texas and a million increase in expenses related to california 
the increase in texas is a direct result of the significant increase in that book of business throughout and the maintaining of this premium level throughout the increase in california relates to start up costs as we began to write standard homeowner s business in california in the combined ratio for the standard property casualty segment was as of december  as compared to  resulting in the improvements in the segment s pre tax results from continuing operations year over year 
the improvement in the combined ratio from to is primarily a result of a improvement in the loss ratio resulting from improvements in claim severity 
offsetting the improvement in claim severity was an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to the million net loss related to a series of hailstorms in texas and the southeastern united states 
non standard agency segment total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or as compared to total revenues of million for the prior year 
commission income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or as compared to commission income of million for the prior year 
commission income for our affiliated underwriting agencies for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or as compared to the commission income of million for our affiliated underwriting agencies during the prior year 
the increase in commission income for our affiliated underwriting agencies in as compared to was principally due to more favorable commission rates and an increase in contingent commission income related to positive loss ratio development

liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources holding company vesta is a holding company whose principal asset is its investment in the capital stock of the companies constituting the vesta insurance group 
the principal uses of funds at the holding company level are to pay operating expenses  principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and deferrable capital securities  and dividends to stockholders as declared by the board of directors 
vesta s principal source of liquidity and capital resources to meet its holding company obligations is dividends paid by our subsidiaries 
many of our subsidiaries are insurance companies that are individually supervised by various state insurance regulators  and other unregulated companies that we own  such as affirmative insurance holdings  inc formerly known as instant insurance holdings  inc  are owned indirectly through a regulated insurance company 
given our organizational structure  we rely on two subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company or otherwise fund the obligations of our holding company on its behalf vesta fire insurance corporation  an illinois domiciled insurer  and j 
gordon gaines  inc  a delaware business corporation 
dividends from vesta fire transactions between vesta and its insurance subsidiaries  including the payment of dividends  are subject to certain limitations under the insurance laws of those subsidiaries domiciliary states 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois  where vesta fire is domiciled  permit the payment of dividends out of unassigned surplus in any year which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  do not exceed the greater of of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or the net income for the preceding year  with larger dividends payable only after receipt of prior regulatory approval 
the illinois insurance department has indicated that these dividend limitations prohibit the payment of dividends if the insurer has negative or zero unassigned funds at the end of the prior year  as reported on its statutorily required annual statement 
our lead insurance subsidiary  vesta fire  reported negative unassigned funds on its annual statement for  and is expected to continue to report negative unassigned funds for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we may not be able to declare and pay a dividend from our lead insurance company subsidiary for the foreseeable future without prior approval 
there can be no assurance that vesta fire will be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approval for the payment of dividends 
vesta fire did not pay any dividends in dividends from j 
gordon gaines j 
gordon gaines  inc provides administrative services to all of our property casualty insurance subsidiaries in exchange for fees pursuant to an administrative services agreement and  with respect to our texas select lloyds insurance company  an attorney in fact agreement 
these management agreements are subject to certain regulatory standards which generally require their terms and fees to be fair and reasonable 
the illinois or texas departments of insurance may review these agreements from time to time to insure the reasonableness of their terms and fees  and it is possible that such terms and fees could be modified to reduce the amounts available to our holding company 
assuming these management agreements are not 
table of contents modified in a material respect  we believe that j 
gordon gaines  inc will be able to pay dividends to our holding company  or otherwise fund the obligations of our holding company on its behalf  sufficient to fund our anticipated needs including debt service for at least the next twelve months 
during  j 
gordon gaines and texas select lloyds paid million in dividends to our holding company 
management believes that the forecasted dividends that will be available from j 
gordon gaines and texas select lloyds will be sufficient to allow our holding company to meet all of its scheduled debt payment and operating expenses in credit facilities effective february   we entered a million revolving credit arrangement with first commercial bank of birmingham  alabama first commercial  secured by a pledge of  shares of our holding company s ownership in the common stock of affirmative insurance holdings  inc representing approximately of affirmative s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock as of december  the new facility bears interest at first commercial s prime rate and will mature no earlier than june  as of december   we had drawn the entire million available under this agreement 
this credit agreement contains covenants which require us to maintain i consolidated gaap net income excluding realized gains and losses of at least million for any calendar year  ii consolidated debt to capital ratio of no more than  measured on a quarterly basis  iii an am best rating of b or better  measured continuously  iv consolidated gaap net worth of at least million  measured quarterly  v an interest coverage ratio of not less than to for any calendar year and vi risk based capital of not less than of the naic s authorized control level  measured continuously 
as of december   the company was in non compliance with its consolidated gaap net income  interest coverage ratio  consolidated debt to capital ratio  and gaap net worth covenants 
first commercial has waived compliance with these covenants through december although management does not anticipate an event of default with respect to these covenants in  there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with these covenants in the future 
furthermore  current dividend levels from vesta fire and j 
gordon gaines would not be sufficient to repay the anticipated outstanding balance of this credit facility were we to violate a covenant without seeking prior approval 
although management believes the company would be able to secure waivers on any future covenant violations  the failure to obtain such waivers of the potential covenant violations or refinance the credit facility on similar terms could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
the failure of the company to secure refinancing of the credit facility would force the company to secure other forms of financing as current operating cash flows would not be sufficient to cover the contractually required debt service requirements 
the company s inability to secure other financing to refinance the credit facility would have a material adverse impact on the company 
additionally  refinancing the credit facility with other financing at higher interest rates could negatively impact the company s financial performance 
liquidity and capital resources subsidiary operations the principal sources of funds for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums  investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of invested assets 
the principal uses of funds in our subsidiary operations are the payment of claims  operating expenses  commissions and the purchase of investments 
our subsidiaries also borrow funds from the federal home loan bank from time to time and invest the proceeds at higher interest rates  and we have a need to repay these funds to the fhlb as indicated in the table illustrating our overall contractual obligations presented below 
our subsidiary operations also involve ongoing reinsurance recoverable disputes that could result in an obligation to repay certain amounts to reinsurers from whom we have collected funds 
in connection with these disputes  our principal operating subsidiary  vesta fire  has obtained letters of credit for the benefit of reinsurers for which it is contingently liable 
at december   vesta fire was contingently liable for million under the terms of letters of credit obtained in connection with these reinsurance disputes 
additionally  we regularly obtain letters of credit or otherwise pledge securities for the benefit of ceding insurers in our nonstandard underwriting segment pursuant to reinsurance contracts 
as of december   we had pledged approximately million in securities pursuant to these reinsurance contracts 
in the event we are unsuccessful in having the nrma arbitration ruling vacated  vesta fire will be required to make a million payment to nrma by april  vesta fire has sufficient level of liquid assets to meet this obligation in the event payment is required

table of contents statements 
as of december   our insurance company subsidiaries held million face amount of our senior debentures due and million face amount of our senior notes due in december of our holding company paid these subsidiaries approximately million in interest payments in which was eliminated in consolidation 
current dividend levels from vesta fire and j 
gordon gaines are not sufficient to repay the entirety of the inter company obligations 
failure to repay these amounts could have a material adverse affect on the statutory capital of our subsidiaries 
furthermore  failure to receive regulatory approval to refinance these obligations on favorable terms could negatively impact the financial results of the company 
cash flows as is typical in the insurance industry  we collect cash in the form of premiums and invest that cash until claims are paid 
cash collected from premiums and cash paid for claims are included in cash flow from operations  while the cash impact from our investing activities is included in cash flow from investing activities 
in periods such as and  when we were exiting certain lines of business such as commercial lines and reinsurance assumed lines  we funded the payout of commercial and reinsurance assumed claims through the liquidation of invested assets  consistent with the historical insurance business model 
however  this generates cash outflows from operations that can be misleading 
on a consolidated basis  net cash used in provided by operations for the year ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
cash flow from operations was negative for the current period primarily due to decreases in reinsurance balances payable and unearned premium reserves  reflecting the impact of our increased reinsurance activity at the end of and throughout net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  reflecting the impact of acquisitions in the current year offset by lower investment security purchases
