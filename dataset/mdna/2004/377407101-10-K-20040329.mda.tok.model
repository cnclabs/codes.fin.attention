off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commitments off balance sheet arrangements 
the bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts 
loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates  and may require payment of a fee 
lines of credit generally have variable interest rates 
many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  accordingly  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral or other security obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
collateral held varies but may include deposits held in financial institutions  us treasury securities  other marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  personal residences  income producing commercial properties  and land under development 
personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including collateral  as outstanding loans 
as of december   the bank has accrued  for unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  which is included in other liabilities 
contractual obligations 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due in one to three to over note one year three five five in thousands reference or less years years years total deposits without a stated maturity a  c time deposits a short term borrowings a long term borrowings b operating leases a excludes interest b includes junior subordinated debentures and semi annual payments made in march and september of  this is also assuming that the debentures will be paid off in september c includes non interest bearing deposits 
table of contents commitments 
the following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of december  further discussion of these commitments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due in one to three to over one year three five five in thousands or less years years years total loan commitments other mortgage loans unused lines of credit home equity lines commercial lines unsecured consumer lines letters of credit asset liability management net interest income  the primary component of the company s net income  arises from the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
the company manages its assets and liabilities by coordinating the levels of and gap between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize changes in net interest income and in the economic value of its equity despite changes in market interest rates 
the bank s asset liability and risk management committee meets on a monthly basis to monitor compliance with the board s objectives 
among other tools used by the asset liability and risk management committee to monitor interest rate risk is a gap report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap position would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while  conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
during recent periods  the company has maintained a negative gap position that has benefited earnings as interest rates have fallen 
in order to reduce its negative gap position  the company has recently begun investing in mortgage backed and other government securities which have rates that adjust to market rates 
the company also maintains a significant portfolio of available for sale securities that can be quickly converted to more liquid assets if needed 
the following table sets forth the bank s interest rate sensitivity at december  
table of contents over to over over months months through years years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks federal funds and overnight deposits securities loans fixed assets other assets total assets liabilities demand deposit accounts now accounts money market deposit accounts savings accounts ira accounts certificates of deposit other liabilities junior subordinated debenture stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity gap cumulative gap cumulative gap as a of total assets the foregoing analysis assumes that the bank s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity 
mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity 
certificates of deposit and ira accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity 
now savings accounts are assumed to reprice within three months although it is the company s experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates 
liquidity and capital resources the company currently has no business other than that of the bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the bank 
the bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the bank s principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income  deposits from its primary market area  principal and interest payments on loans  interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities 
its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits 
deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the bank s lending and investment activities 
the bank also uses borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta to supplement deposits  residential and small business lending  and to meet specific and anticipated needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which are cash on hand  amounts due from financial institutions  federal funds sold and money market mutual funds 
the levels of such assets are dependent on the bank s operating financing and investment activities at any given time 
the variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows 
cash and cash equivalents cash due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  and federal funds sold  as of december   totaled  a decrease of  or  from the december  total of  most of this decrease was due to a reduction in the federal funds sold 
as of december   the bank was permitted to draw on a million line of credit from the fhlb of atlanta 
borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the bank s residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of us government and agency securities 
as of december   a million long term convertible advance was outstanding under this line 
in addition the bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of 
table of contents million from another commercial bank on which it has not drawn 
furthermore  on september   the company issued  of its junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to glen burnie statutory trust i  a connecticut statutory trust wholly owned by the company 
the trust  in turn  issued  of its capital securities to institutional investors 
the debentures are scheduled to mature on september   unless called by the company not earlier than september  as of december   the full  was outstanding 
federal banking regulations require the company and the bank to maintain specified levels of capital 
at december   the company was in compliance with these requirements with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and total risk based capital ratio of 
at december   the bank met the criteria for designation as a well capitalized depository institution under fdic regulations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in mature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  starting on page f and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed there  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from the company s estimates 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principles involved in the preparation of the company s financial statements  including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process allowance for credit losses 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur  including historical losses as an indicator of future losses  fair market value of collateral  and various general or industry or geographic specific economic events 
the use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
for further information regarding our allowance for credit losses  see allowance for credit losses under item business of this annual report 
accrued taxes 
management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
income taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretations no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a vie are to be included in an entity s consolidated financial statements 
a vie exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself  or the equity investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest 
those characteristics include the 
table of contents direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of an entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
during the third quarter of  the company applied the provisions of fin to a wholly owned subsidiary trust that issued capital securities to third party investors 
the application of fin resulted in the deconsolidation of a wholly owned subsidiary trust 
see note for further discussion of this trust and the company s related obligations 
in december  the fasb reissued fin with certain modifications and clarifications 
application of this guidance was effective for interests in certain vies commonly referred to as special purpose entities spes as of december  application for all other types of entities is required for periods ending after march   unless previously applied 
management continues to evaluate the applicability of fin management does not believe that the application of fin will have an impact on financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
the federal reserve board is currently evaluating the impact on tier capital 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under sfas  as well as amends certain other existing fasb pronouncements 
in general  sfas is effective for derivative transactions entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on financial condition  the results of operations  or liquidity  as the company and bank does not have derivative or hedging instruments 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of sfas became effective june   for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and otherwise became effective as of july  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on financial condition  the results of operations  or liquidity 
in december  the fasb deferred for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in sfas to noncontrolling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parent s financial statements under sfas the deferral is limited to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
management does not believe any such applicable entities exist as of december  in march  the sec issued regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
as defined in regulation g  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future performance  financial position  or cash flow that excludes or includes amounts or adjustments that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
companies that present non gaap financial measures must disclose a numerical reconciliation to the most directly comparable measurement using gaap 
in january  the sec adopted final rules implementing section a of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires disclosure of off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations in a public company s periodic sec reports 
off balance sheet arrangements include guarantees and similar arrangements that may be a source of potential risk to a company s future liquidity  capital resources and results of operations  regardless of whether or not they are recorded as liabilities 
the definition uses gaap concepts to identify the four types of arrangements for which disclosure is required guarantee contracts  retained or contingent liabilities  certain derivative instruments and variable interests 
off balance sheet arrangements that either have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect that is material to investors with respect to the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources must be disclosed 
companies must explain the reasons for using off balance sheet arrangements  the financial importance and magnitude thereof and circumstances that could trigger obligations 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and have been discussed elsewhere in this report 

table of contents under the final rules  tabular disclosure of contractual obligations for specified time periods must also be made 
contractual obligations must be aggregated into categories applicable to a company s business  for example i long term debt  ii capital lease obligations  iii operating leases  iv purchase obligations  and v other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap 
however  each company should use categories suitable to its business
