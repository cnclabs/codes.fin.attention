item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary the year marked a watershed for schlumberger as we took the decision to focus on our core businesses in oilfield services 
our reasoning was simple 
world energy needs for much of the next half century will be met mostly by carbon based fuels produced from an aging reserves base 
substantial investment will be needed to sustain today s production as well as to meet tomorrow s demand  and technology will be the key to a cleaner  more cost effective response to this challenge 
we therefore believe the future for schlumberger is exceptionally bright 
the year s results for oilfield services were robust  with growth in all regions 
among the geomarket regions  activity was strongest in mexico  indonesia  india  the caspian  and on land in the united states 
most technology segments registered double digit gains  with records achieved by drilling measurements and data consulting services 
much of the technology that saw increasing market penetration was associated with boosting performance in mature fields  or brownfields  to stem declining production 
rotary steerable systems to accurately place well trajectories to tap bypassed hydrocarbon pockets and a range of cased hole wireline evaluation tools to analyze such zones were two particular successes 
a number of technical and business highlights marked the year 
integrated project management ipm continued to grow  particularly in mexico  where our history of successful projects led to the award of the chicontepec contract  the most significant oil development project in mexico in the last years 
in malaysia  we signed a contract with petronas carigali sdn 
bhd 
to jointly redevelop the bokor field that began production in the s 
this field  comprising more than stacked sands and over producing strings  has been modeled using the latest techniques and the redevelopment plan involves multiple technology segments 
such projects underline the value of our unique geomarket organization 
in december we announced a phased agreement to acquire petroalliance  russia s largest independent oilfield service company  beginning with a minority share in petroalliance was formed in to provide a broad range of exploration and development services to international standards 
the size and scope of activity in russia is huge  and this type of investment will benefit schlumberger and the russian oil industry as that industry seeks access to technology to be applied to its particular needs for continued growth 
perhaps the most difficult challenge we set for ourselves early in was to return westerngeco to sustainable profitability 
continued overcapacity in both the land and marine and multiclient data markets made this a daunting task 
our approach has been threefold to bring capacity and cost down to appropriate levels  to reflect a proper carrying value for the data library  and to continue the aggressive introduction of proprietary q technology  for which the market has continued to grow rapidly 
last summer we acquired the first marine time lapse q survey for statoil  km from the western coast of norway 
twenty one months had elapsed between the two surveys 
initial results  produced only days after acquisition  enabled statoil to revise plans for a new well and drill a shallower trajectory to remain clear of the oil water contact 
the well was a success and is producing without making water 
the reliability and extremely high repeatability of q marine technology were considered critical to achieving this result 
in other applications  a q system was commissioned in the middle east late in the year and q seabed underwent highly successful trials in both the north sea and middle east 
in defining the business activities sold with schlumbergersema  we maintained our commitment to the growing activity in oil and gas it solutions 
the natural fusion of the schlumberger software and information management activities with the schlumbergersema oil gas consulting and network infrastructure businesses began in october  and by year end business managers were in place throughout the geomarket organization 
we have chosen to retain the schlumberger information solutions name for the enlarged business  and our objective is to help customers extract more value from their core operational processes through leveraging the combination of our domain knowledge in it and in exploration and production e p

table of contents part ii  item early in we stated clear financial goals 
by year end we had made solid progress 
return on capital employed had risen to in the fourth quarter  double the corresponding figure in and well in line with our intention to reach the mid teens longer term 
after tax return on sales for oilfield services reached in the same quarter a level much more consistent with our performance in previous cycles 
net debt fell to billion  just shy of our billion target as a result of adverse currency movements 
for more information regarding the purposes for which we use net debt  see page of this report 
in january  we concluded the sale of the major part of schlumbergersema to atos origin and reduced our holding in that company to 
total cash proceeds from the cash and stock sale amounted to billion 
with conclusion of the sale of the north american electricity meter business and the sales of the business continuity  infodata  and telecom software products businesses we expect to see net debt below the billion level by the middle of beyond that point  the only significant divestiture remaining will be the ipo of axalto  the schlumberger smart card business  as and when market conditions permit 
in  schlumberger operated four business segments oilfield services  westerngeco  schlumbergersema and other 
the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements

oilfield services world oil demand surged in due to strong economic growth in north america and china 
the increase in demand from these areas accounted for almost two thirds of overall world oil demand growth 
the rise in world oil production more than matched demand growth 
non opec oil production accounted for one third of the increase  due to expanding production in the cis 
opec output increased despite supply disruptions in venezuela and nigeria and the loss of iraqi production during and after the war 
oil prices remained high throughout the year  with an average western texas intermediate wti oil price almost higher than in slb form k 
table of contents part ii  item in  the rate of global oil demand growth is expected to be similar to  with oil demand projected to grow strongly in developing countries and ease in oecd countries 
non opec oil production is forecast to grow at roughly similar levels to although there is more uncertainty over the level of supply in the cis and the us 
opec production is likely to be adjusted to maintain the price of the opec basket of crude in the stated target price range of to per barrel 
north american gas demand in showed little change compared to  and is not expected to vary much in however  maintaining gas supply to meet demand is challenging  as production decline rates are already high and expected to increase further 
the average annual us natural gas price in rose considerably compared to last year and has stimulated growth in the number of active drilling rigs in north america 
relatively high commodity prices in and increases in production have resulted in high levels of cash generation in the oil and gas industry  and a subsequent increase in the average number of active drilling rigs 
assuming demand remains strong and that opec manages to maintain oil prices in its target range  exploration and production e p spending is expected to increase in results revenue of billion increased in versus led by north america with an increase of  followed by latin america and middle east asia  which both increased  and europe cis w 
africa  which was up 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than in  primarily due to strong customer demand resulting from increased e p expenditures and customer acceptance of new technologies  such as powerdrive rotary steerable systems  litecrete coalbed methane slurry system  abc analysis behind casing suite of services  viscoelastic diverting acid vda advanced acidizing system  and clearfrac polymer free fracturing fluid 
overhead cost savings of million generated from restructuring and downsizing efforts  principally in europe cis w 
africa and north south america  also contributed to the increased profitability during the year 
oilfield services began the year with relatively flat revenue in the first quarter  then achieved modest  but continuous growth over the following three quarters due to new contracts  the introduction of new technologies  and increased demand for integrated project management and schlumberger information solutions sis services 
the results were positively impacted by an upturn in natural gas drilling in north america  and increased activity in mexico  russia and the middle east  partially offset by a nationwide strike in venezuela and ethnic unrest in nigeria 
all technology product lines helped drive revenue growth 
well services and drilling measurements record levels of revenue contributed to more than half of the increase in oilfield services revenue 
data consulting services drew the award of several contracts for reservoir modeling  field development planning  and production optimization 
sis experienced strong demand  particularly in europe  asia  and the middle east 
integrated project management ipm experienced high activity levels principally fueled by latin america 
in december  schlumberger announced a phased agreement to acquire petroalliance beginning with a minority share in petroalliance is russia s largest independent oilfield services company  and provides a broad range of exploration and development services throughout russia and the caspian 
north america north america revenue of billion increased versus the growth in revenue was mainly due to increased activity in us land  as well as canada  which had a increase in revenue to million 
both markets were driven by strong commodity prices  which  in turn  were caused by the record low gas storage levels at the end of the drawdown season 
this growth was not mirrored in the gulf of mexico where activity was essentially flat year on year 
a combination of factors contributed to the sluggish performance slb form k 
table of contents part ii  item offshore  including higher finding and developing cost on the shelf  lack of exploration success in deepwater and unfavorable weather conditions hampering drilling and completion efficiency on a number of deepwater projects 
pretax operating income of million increased over primarily due to a beneficial fall through resulting from improved equipment utilization in us land following asset rationalization and cost containment 
increased demand for drilling measurements  cased hole wireline and hydraulic fracturing solutions  related to increased complexity in developing new gas reserves in us land  also contributed to profitability improvement 
latin america latin america revenue of billion increased versus primarily due to substantial increases in mexico  brazil and argentina  partially offset by a significant decline in venezuela 
large scale project management contracts substantially accounted for the growth in activity in mexico 
growth in brazil was driven by a strong increase in petrobras exploration activity  and argentina benefited from the high oil price 
the political turmoil in the early part of the year substantially impacted results in venezuela  however the focus on restoring production favorably drove the revenue in the latter half of the year 
the increase in e p spending in mexico was driven by the compelling need to satisfy the domestic demand for natural gas  increase the light oil production and ramp up the oil production potential 
key contracts that contributed to revenue growth included project management of a four year  million integrated oilfield services project which represents the most significant oil development project in mexico in the last years  and a two year  million information management solution 
pretax operating income of million was up year on year with all areas excluding venezuela contributing to improved profitability 
there were record levels of integrated project management contracts in mexico and positive fall through on incremental revenue in argentina and brazil 
europe cis west africa revenue of billion increased over  primarily in russia due to growth in e p spending and continued expansion of the addressable market  which drove increased fracturing activity  high sales of artificial lift pumps  and the adoption of more advanced drilling technologies 
cis reached a record revenue level of million  higher than an increase in the number of e p companies entering the development phase of deepwater projects in the west south africa geomarket during the second half of  and an offshore gas project in the mediterranean also contributed to overall activity improvement in the area  principally in well completions productivity and well services technologies 
these results were partially offset by lower exploration activity by the major oil companies in the north sea and by production shutdowns in the western niger delta in nigeria due to socio political unrest 
pretax operating income of million increased over primarily due to cost savings generated at the beginning of the year  as well as increased activities in west south africa due to deepwater activities moving into a more lucrative development phase 
this was partially offset by appreciation of currencies against the us dollar negatively impacting the results by million later in the year 
middle east asia revenue of billion increased over with more than half the growth coming from saudi arabia kuwait  egypt and indonesia 
despite geopolitical uncertainty in the period leading up to the war in iraq and relative softness in asia principally caused by the sars outbreak  revenue showed marked improvement primarily due to higher demand for drilling measurements  wireline and well completion productivity technologies in egypt  saudi arabia kuwait and indonesia partially offset by reduced activity in malaysia brunei philippines due to the suspension of planned deepwater development work resulting from the slb form k 
table of contents part ii  item deepwater acreage dispute between malaysia and brunei 
late in the year  strong year on year improvements across the region were tempered by reduced rig activity in saudi arabia due to customers accelerated spending in the first three quarters 
pretax operating income of million increased  primarily due to the operating leverage on increased revenue across most geomarkets  principally caused by increased activity in indonesia s east kalimantan and stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in east africa 
results revenue for was billion versus billion in reflecting reduced activity in north america and latin america  which was partially mitigated by higher activity in europe cis w 
africa and the middle east asia 
pretax operating income of billion decreased primarily from reduced margins in wireline and well services as activity declined in north america 
a sharp fall in revenue at the beginning of reflected declining activity levels in north america  which remained depressed for the remainder of the year  together with political and economic uncertainty in latin america 
in the second and third quarters  robust activity in europe cis w 
africa  and signs of a possible recovery in asia  mitigated the effects of low north american drilling levels resulting in increased revenue 
however  this trend was short lived as slower activity outside north america due mainly to seasonal influences coupled with budget cuts resulted in lower fourth quarter revenue 
the caspian  russia and mexico geomarkets posted the highest double digit year on year revenue growth of  and  respectively 
from a technology standpoint  the strongest performer was well completions productivity where acquisitions  testing  advanced completions systems and artificial lift technology showed market share gains 
during the year  schlumberger acquired a 
comeau associates limited  a leading provider of electrical engineering products and services for artificially lifted wells 
this latest addition  combined with the successful integration of sensa and phoenix technologies into the schlumberger artificial lift services portfolio  contributed to higher sales in  particularly in the eastern hemisphere 
the drilling measurements technology segment also recorded solid revenue growth fuelled largely by the continued penetration of the powerdrive rotary steerable system into new geomarkets 
schlumberger made two further acquisitions during the year to bolster its real time reservoir management suite of services 
in january  schlumberger acquired norwegian based inside reality as providing new d virtual reality systems that create a unique and powerful environment for interactive well planning and real time geosteering analysis 
schlumberger also acquired the software and services business of technoguide as  a leader in the reservoir modeling domain 
north america revenue of billion decreased versus a steep revenue decline at the outset of the year reflected a continued lackluster drilling environment and unseasonably mild weather conditions 
throughout the remainder of the year activity levels remained depressed resulting in essentially flat revenue for other factors contributing to reduced revenue included lower non rig related activity resulting in lower wireline  well services  and well completions productivity revenue  the effects of the tropical storms in the third quarter and a slow pick up in canadian activity post spring break up 
pretax operating income of million decreased from million in due to pricing pressures across all services  particularly in well services and well completions productivity 
latin america revenue of billion decreased versus ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the region continued to affect business conditions  particularly in venezuela and argentina 
this particularly impacted results in the first half of the year 
in sharp contrast  the second half of saw solid growth partly as a slb form k 
table of contents part ii  item result of higher demand for drilling measurements and well completions technologies connected to contracts in the burgos basin 
in addition  the completion of an ipm project that involved the sale of production facilities in ecuador for million in the fourth quarter contributed to end of year higher revenue 
pretax operating income of million declined as a result of decreased activity in venezuela and argentina 
europe cis west africa revenue of billion increased versus strong revenue growth was recorded in the first three quarters reflecting increased activity levels and market share gains particularly in the caspian and russia geomarkets in respect to artificial lift and drilling technologies 
the well completions productivity technology segment recorded the strongest growth of followed by drilling measurements  which grew 
this growth was partially mitigated by a steep revenue drop in the fourth quarter due to exceptionally severe winter weather conditions in the north sea and russia that affected all services  particularly fracturing activities 
in addition  operator budget cuts in the nigeria geomarket and refocused investment decisions in the uk contributed to lower fourth quarter revenue 
pretax operating income was million compared to million in  with the very slight decrease due to softening in pricing towards the end of the year and restructuring in the region to reduce support infrastructure to match slowing activity levels 
middle east asia revenue of billion increased versus after a decline at the beginning of the year resulting from exceptional artificial lift sales at the end of  the asian market showed signs of recovery highlighted by strong revenue growth in the second quarter 
over the year  the india and malaysia brunei philippines geomarkets recorded the strongest growth due to increased activity in these countries 
in addition  the wireline and well services technology segments posted the highest growth  up and  respectively 
this was partly offset by a slowdown in activity in the second half of due to a number of major projects nearing completion and lower equipment sales 
pretax operating income of million was up versus results revenue of billion increased over increased non rig related activity and higher pricing levels contributed to the growth 
first quarter results reflected continued high activity in north america and increased demand internationally  but a softening in north american drilling activity in the third quarter offset international growth 
market share gains  improved pricing levels  and the introduction of new technology contributed to strong growth in the drilling measurements and well completions productivity technology segments 
three key acquisitions were made during the year baker jardine software tools  it consulting and integrated solutions that help operators increase oil and gas production  sensa fiber optic sensing technologies  and phoenix technologies and techniques for optimizing production from artificially lifted wells 
pretax operating income of billion increased over last year 
north america revenue of billion increased versus the strong revenue growth in the first quarter of plateaued in the middle of the year 
this was due to slower economic conditions and declining natural gas prices  which resulted in reduced activity towards the end of the year 
the alaska and gulf coast geomarkets recorded the strongest revenue growth due to increased demand for drilling measurements  well services  and wireline technologies

europe cis west africa revenue of billion increased 
overall moderate growth was led by high demand for well completions services in nigeria  and strong growth in both drilling measurements and wireline services in russia 
growth in the west south africa geomarket was partly due to an early production facility project for ipm during the year 
pretax operating income of million increased due mainly to the well completions productivity segment  which recorded strong growth across most geomarkets

pretax operating income of grew due to increases in the drilling measurements and well completions productivity technology segments 
westerngeco results revenue for was billion versus billion in  reflecting a decrease year on year 
this was primarily due to lower land crew activity following the exiting of the north american land market combined with the completion of some contracts in the middle east 
the decrease in revenue was also due to declines in multiclient sales principally in north south america  partially offset by increased marine activity in europe  caspian and the middle east 
q marine continued to gain customer acceptance with vessel utilization on third party contracts in the third quarter  and the first q on q time lapse survey  which was performed in the north sea with initial processing results available after days 
the end of the year saw a return to traditional seasonal multiclient revenue levels partially helped by the signing of a long term business agreement with a major energy company that included the licensing of part of the westerngeco data library  as well as joint r d and training on new technology for seismic data processing 
including multiclient pre commitments  the backlog at the end of reached million  reflecting the award of a number of land contracts in the middle east and a material multiclient volume agreement signed in the fourth quarter 
during  q marine continued to command significant pricing premiums as a result of the added value obtained from the delivered product  but pricing across other business segments was flat to down for conventional marine  land and data processing activity due to continued overcapacity in the industry 
the company s decision to acquire only significantly prefunded multiclient surveys  along with lower amortization following the impairment charge in  resulted in the multiclient product line being in a much healthier condition at the end of the year 
q marine penetration continued strong  reflected by the doubling of q revenue year on year 
pretax operating loss was million versus a profit of million in excluding multiclient impairment and other charges in both years mainly due to significantly higher multiclient amortization charges as a result of lower sales and a more conservative amortization policy in light of business conditions 
the lower multiclient sales were primarily due to an overall lessening in interest in the gulf of mexico from slb form k 
table of contents part ii  item the major oil companies coupled with an average price reduction of approximately during the year 
the deterioration in the multiclient results was partially offset by an improvement in land and marine following the fourth quarter restructuring program combined with better service delivery 
in the third quarter  an impairment charge of million pretax was taken against the multiclient library and there was a million pretax charge on the western trident and western monarch vessels 
results westerngeco revenue of billion decreased compared to the prior year  primarily due to decreased activity in north america and europe cis w 
africa  which were partially offset by increases in latin america and the middle east asia 
the seismic downturn continued throughout resulting in significantly lower activity levels  a reduction in multiclient sales  and extreme pricing pressures on all services due to large overcapacity in the seismic industry 
significant workforce reductions were made in the fourth quarter of as a result of the decision to stop land acquisition activities in the us lower states and canada 
pretax operating income of million fell  primarily due to significantly lower multiclient sales and decreased activities in north america coupled with land seismic contract losses in mexico and marine seismic contract losses in india  both of which were related to production delays 
results the westerngeco joint venture was formed on november  revenue in was billion and pretax operating income was million 
the malaysia brunei philippines  alaska  gulf coast  and west south africa geomarkets recorded the strongest results for the year 
multiclient sales of million in a favorable pricing environment also contributed to the high level of activity and were the major contributor to the operating income

table of contents part ii  item critical accounting policies and estimates schlumberger s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon schlumberger s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires schlumberger to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  schlumberger evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories and investments  recoverability of long lived assets  income tax provision and deferred taxes  profit assumptions on long term percentage of completion contracts  contingencies and litigation and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
schlumberger believes the critical accounting policies described below affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
schlumberger follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known as a change in estimate 
losses on long term contracts are provided for when such losses are known and reasonably estimated 
schlumberger recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
whether the fee is fixed and determinable is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
collection is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements  such as those including installation and integration services  are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element and when the delivered elements have stand alone value to the customers 
for sales  either a binding purchase order  signed license agreement or a written contract is used as evidence of an arrangement 
revenue from maintenance services is recognized ratably over the contract term 
the training and consulting services time and materials are billed based on hourly rates  and revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from outsourcing services is generally recognized as services are performed 
the westerngeco segment capitalizes the cost associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on a percentage of estimated total revenue that schlumberger estimates that it will receive from the sales of such data 
the carrying value of individual surveys is reviewed at least annually and adjustments to the value are made based upon the revised estimated revenues for the surveys 
schlumberger maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of schlumberger s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
slb form k 
table of contents part ii  item schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory writedowns may be required 
schlumberger assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in schlumberger s stock price and our market capitalization relative to net book value  for a sustained period 
when schlumberger determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment is measured based on projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
schlumberger had net deferred tax assets of million at december  which excluded million relating to a certain european net operating loss for which there is a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for valuation allowances  schlumberger considers the probable likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
with regard to pension and postretirement benefits  schlumberger evaluates the appropriateness of assumptions used by an independent actuary  in particular assumptions as to discount rate  return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
the assumptions are revised at least annually as circumstances require
