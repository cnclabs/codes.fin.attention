item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under business forward looking statements and risk factors  elsewhere in this report or in the information incorporated by reference in this report 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data included in this report  as well as our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on january references contained in this report to a given fiscal year refer to the twelve month period ended january of the succeeding year 
for example  our fiscal year ended january  is referred to in this report as fiscal overview we provide payments related software and consulting solutions to financial institutions and financial service providers 
we serve all of the top and of the next largest commercial banks in the united states 
we also consider other geographic regions to be important elements of our market opportunity 
our products and services traverse a broad spectrum of payment activities and are designed to improve operational efficiency in how payments are processed  enhance revenue and profitability from payments oriented products and services  reduce losses associated with fraudulent payment transactions  and or improve the alignment of product offerings with our customer needs  hence maximizing their customer income streams 
we are organized into three primary operating divisions global payments technologies gpt  revenue enhancement reve and global payments consulting gpc 
these three divisions bring together the capabilities essential to providing the innovation and delivery engines for our products and services 
global payments technologies 
this division is responsible for design  development  sales  and support of our technology solutions 
revenue is primarily derived from license fees  implementation fees and maintenance fees 
revenue enhancement 
this highly specialized practice group provides consulting and software solutions focused on increasing clients revenue streams 
areas of expertise include fee income  market segmentation  management of customer price structures  account retention  acquisitions and profitability 
a majority of the revenue generated by this division is through benefit sharing agreements with our customers  recorded as consulting revenue along with license fees  maintenance fees and implementation fees from our enact software offering 
global payments consulting 
the objective of this professional services division is to provide our clients with applied thought leadership related to the business of payments 
in fiscal  coming off of the bubble of yk consulting efforts and the completion of the last wave of financial institution integrations consummated in the late s  we commenced an effort to transition our consulting business from a yk and staff supplement focus to a thought leadership in payments focus 
this transition continued in fiscal our services for gpc are designed around the needs of our clients to set strategies  develop operating plans and execute these strategies and plans in the business of payments 
these services range from strategy to implementation support 
revenue in the gpc division is primarily derived through the delivery of consulting services offered primarily on a time and materials basis to our clients  along with the license fees  maintenance fees and services fees associated with our float pricing system software offering 
cost of revenues and gross margins 
we strive to control our cost of revenues and thereby maintain or improve our gross margins 
the major items impacting cost of consulting  cost of software maintenance and cost of software implementation are driven by personnel overhead and related expenses 
the major items impacting cost of software licenses are amortization of both capitalized and acquired software and also software royalties for software from third parties 
while the amortization expense is relatively fixed  the third party royalty expense can vary significantly based on the relative product mix 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative and research and development  are substantially driven by personnel and overhead expenses 
other significant operating expenses that we monitor include professional fees  use of contractors  travel  insurance and office services expenses 
liquidity and cash flows 
cash and cash equivalents at january  and totaled million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities  used million of cash for investing activities and used million for financing activities 
our primary utilization of cash in fiscal was to reduce our debt under our revolving credit agreement 
previous restatement of consolidated financial statements the selected consolidated financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a reflects the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended january    and  and for each of the quarters in the year ended january  and the first two quarters of the year ended january  the restatement gives effect to the following in december  a special committee of our board of directors initiated a review of our financial statements  principally focused on the timing of recognition of revenue in prior periods 
during this investigation we became aware that  in certain instances  revenue had been recorded on contracts in one accounting period where customer signature and delivery of software had been completed  but where the contract may not have been fully executed by us in that accounting period 
we determined that revisions to certain prior financial statements were necessary to ensure that all agreements for which revenue was recognized in an accounting period were executed by both parties no later than the end of the accounting period in which the revenue was being recognized 
we had originally concluded that under the criteria of sop services were not essential to the functionality of the software  requiring recognition of software license revenue at the time of delivery of the software 
however as a result of a review conducted by the special committee of our board of directors  we decided that when implementation fees are received for specific types of transactions in which we are licensing software and performing certain implementation services  these services are more properly considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement 
therefore  the related license revenue and implementation revenue should have been recognized as the services were performed using the percentage of completion method rather than upon delivery of the software 
the impact of these revisions on total revenue was to defer the timing of revenue recognition for transactions that combine both a software license and implementation services 
as a result of the impact of changes in the timing of revenue recognition  we have also revised the related royalty expense  commission expense and federal income tax provision benefit  and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january  of million 
during the review  we also determined that deferred maintenance revenue recorded at the time of the acquisition of check solutions on june  was not correct and resulted in recording maintenance revenue in periods subsequent to the acquisition in excess of the appropriate amounts 
as a result  goodwill and deferred revenue were overstated in the purchase price allocation by million 
we also determined that revenue was understated on two contracts  resulting in additional license fee revenue of million during the quarterly period ended april and implementation fee revenue of  over the period july through july in the aggregate for the year ended january   the restatement adjustments had the following effects on total revenue and net loss in thousands year ended january  as reported restated total revenues   net loss   results of operations comparison of year ended january  fiscal to year ended january  fiscal and year ended january  fiscal revenues in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy revenue enhancement global payments technologies global payments consulting total revenues the increase in revenue within the revenue enhancement reve segment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of increased demand for our enact software offering 
this demand is being driven by the trend among our customers to expend investments in branch locations  resulting in pressure to show greater returns on these branch investments through profitable sales growth  which enact helps generate 
the increase in revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of an million increase in our traditional revenue enhancement consulting revenue as we were successful in generating revenue from our existing customer base along with increasing our focus on smaller financial institutions with the introduction of specifically designed offerings for these institutions 
additionally  during the latter half of fiscal  the events of september  negatively affected customer purchasing decisions for our revenue enhancement consulting services 
the decline in revenue within the global payments technologies gpt segment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily the result of four factors i fiscal had a number of transactions for software included in the results for the year that did not involve implementation services and hence revenue was recognized immediately increasing software license revenue in fiscal  ii decisions on technology investments and services projects were delayed out of fiscal by several of our customers due to the announcement of several mergers involving our customers  iii customer decisions on technology investments were delayed generally out of fiscal as the industry  our customers  other key constituencies eg federal reserve and key processors and our competitors focused on check readiness and opportunities  and iv losses of a few deals to competitors as these competitors dramatically improved their software offerings and services and offered aggressive pricing proposals 
the increase in revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal is primarily the result of the inclusion of a full year of operations of check solutions in fiscal  as compared to only seven months in fiscal following the acquisition in june the decline in revenues within our global payments consulting gpc segment in both fiscal and fiscal is the result of three primary factors 
in fiscal  the majority of the consulting work performed by gpc was the result of bank consolidation and staff augmentation assignments 
the demand for both of these types of work declined significantly 
late in fiscal  we began to reposition this segment to address enterprise wide payment strategies and image enablement planning and integration 
additionally  new leadership in this business has been required 
the timeframe to accomplish these objectives has been longer than anticipated 
overall  as we look across our three business segments  we believe that we are well positioned  and have a competitive advantage  to capitalize on the significant changes brought about by the check legislation through our subject matter expertise in the impacted areas 
based on this outlook  we anticipate modest revenue growth in fiscal  with more attractive growth rates in fiscal as our customers invest in the technology solutions associated with the check legislation and our other new risk solutions products 
consulting fees in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy consulting fees consulting revenues derived from our reve segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal within revenue enhancement  we are increasingly focused on maximizing the value to our existing customer base 
in fiscal  of the revenue producing engagements were with customers in which revenue was derived in fiscal in fiscal  of the engagements were with customers in which revenue was derived in fiscal additionally  revenue enhancement consulting revenue derived from international customers increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal the increase in revenue enhancement consulting revenues in fiscal was partially due to the success of marketing specifically designed offerings to smaller financial institutions 
additionally  during the latter half of fiscal  the negative events of september  negatively affected customer purchasing decisions of these consulting services 
we anticipate that revenue enhancement consulting revenues in fiscal will be slightly higher than fiscal levels 
consulting revenues derived from our gpc segment declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal and prior years the majority of the consulting work performed by gpc related to banks consolidating and reducing redundant operations  and staff augmentation assignments 
in the first half of fiscal  demand for this type of work declined significantly 
by the end of fiscal  we redefined our gpc segment to be synergistic with the payment vision established in our gpt business segment  and developed three primary consulting practices payment operations  payment strategy and float management solutions 
while we have gained some momentum in these areas  we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the future prospects of the gpc segment 
software license fees in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy software license fees most of our software licenses fees are derived from our gpt business segment  which includes the operations of check solutions following our acquisition of that company in june in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year 
legacy carreker software license fees decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal increased revenues during fiscal are principally attributed to two major factors the settlement of the pegasystems  inc litigation in the quarter ended october   which cleared the way for us to begin to license and market our back office processing solutions and the acceptance of our image processing software  namely check image capture and check image archive management products within the marketplace 
license revenue peaked during the first two quarters of fiscal due to sales of million of software expansion licenses and licenses requiring no implementation services  which normally spread revenues over multiple quarters 
in the latter half of fiscal the number and dollar amount of our software license arrangements decreased as compared to the first half of fiscal this slowdown negatively impacted fiscal  as the substantial majority of our software arrangements have essential services that require recognition using the percent complete revenue recognition model 
this decline was in part due to the uncertainty of our special review and ultimate restatement 
additionally  our customers were delaying purchasing decisions due to economic and legislative changes within the industry  namely check during the latter half of fiscal  several new product initiatives were started to address these changes 
exchglink is the product name for our image exchange technology 
this product is being installed at our functional partner site along with an additional beta site  however  all license revenue has been deferred since the product is not generally available 
we anticipate market clarity emerging in the industry  with our customers and competitive offerings surrounding check which gives us confidence in customer buying decisions during fiscal we are also actively building and delivering new or improved products during fiscal in nearly all of our software solutions to respond to check and other opportunities 
combining these factors  we are cautiously optimistic about deriving software license fees revenue growth for fiscal over fiscal levels 
software maintenance fees in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy software maintenance fees as with software license fees  the majority of our maintenance fees are derived from our gpt business segment  which includes the operations of check solutions following our acquisition of that company in june in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year 
software maintenance fees are paid pursuant to annually renewable product and telephone support agreements with our software customers 
the annual maintenance fee is generally paid by the customer at the beginning of the maintenance period and we recognize this maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the related contract 
if the annual maintenance fee is not paid at the beginning of the maintenance period  we defer revenue recognition until the time that the maintenance fee is paid by the customer 
when the payment is received  maintenance revenue is recognized for the period that maintenance revenue was previously deferred 
the overall increases in maintenance fees  in both fiscal and fiscal are due primarily to the expanded product installation base of the acquired check solutions products 
the legacy carreker software maintenance fees have increased as a result of increased revenue from both our fraud mitigation and cash software solutions 
also  maintenance contracts usually carry annual maintenance fee escalation clauses typically based on an index  such as the consumer price index 
these increases will be offset by a customer that recently gave notice of their intent to not renew their maintenance contract for fiscal given this cancellation and the decline in new software license fees discussed above  maintenance fees are projected to decline in fiscal software implementation fees in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy software implementation fees the majority of our software implementation fees are derived from our gpt business segment  which includes the operations of check solutions following our acquisition of that company in june in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year 
in the majority of our customer arrangements  installation services are provided to the customer 
however  in fiscal several large software licenses  including approximately million of image processing software  were licensed without our implementation services  which partially offset our overall increase in software implementation fees 
in fiscal  the decline in software implementation fees paralled the decline in software license fees 
we estimate growth in fiscal as the new product offerings  discussed under software license fees above  are developed and released 
out of pocket expense reimbursements in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy out of pocket expense reimbursements the decrease in these reimbursements in both periods is primarily due to the decline in our gpc business segment 
the majority of these gpc engagements required our employees to be at the customer location for extended periods of time  which gives rise to out of pocket expense reimbursements

vs 
fy fy fy revenue enhancement of revenue global payments technologies of revenue global payments consulting of revenue total cost of revenues of revenue the decrease in total cost of revenues in absolute dollars of million and the increase in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue of in fiscal from in fiscal was primarily the result of lower personnel and outside independent contractor and consulting costs within the gpc business segment 
however  these cost reduction efforts of were less than the reduction in total revenue within this business segment 
the decrease in total cost of revenues in absolute dollars of million and the decrease in total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue of in fiscal from in fiscal was primarily the result of cost reduction efforts within the gpc business segment in response to declining demand for our bank consolidation and staff augmentation consulting services 
additionally  in fiscal  our revenue enhancement business segment recorded a charge of million for the impairment of the value of the guaranteed royalty payments with exchange application  inc  which is more fully described below 
finally  within the gpt business segment  fiscal does contain a fully year of costs for check solutions which was purchased in june this increase in costs in fiscal was balanced by a million impairment charge for the vault software product recorded in fiscal this charge is also more fully described below 
cost of consulting in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy cost of consulting of consulting revenue the cost of consulting consists primarily of personnel costs related to our consulting engagements within both our revenue enhancement and gpc business segments 
the decline in absolute dollars of million along with the decline in consulting costs as a percentage of consulting revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is the result of a million or decline in the consulting costs within the gpc business segment 
these cost reduction efforts were primarily lower personnel and independent contractor costs in response to less demand for our bank consolidation and staff augmentation services 
the decline in absolute dollars of million in fiscal over fiscal along with the sharp decline in consulting costs as a percentage of consulting revenue  also reflected the decline of consulting costs within gpc 
revenue enhancement cost of consulting has remained relatively flat for the period fiscal through fiscal however  in fiscal  the revenue enhancement consulting revenues were million lower than fiscal  primarily due to weak demand as the result of the events of september   which also contributed to the improvement in the percentage of the cost of consulting as a percentage of consulting revenue in fiscal cost of software licenses in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy cost of software licenses of software license revenue the cost of software licenses consist principally of amortization of capitalized and acquired software costs along with royalties payable to third parties 
the increase in absolute dollars of  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily due to the result of increased royalty expense 
the increase in the cost of software licenses  as a percentage of software license revenue  is primarily the result of a decline in software license revenue experienced in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is the result of increased royalty expense and the fact that fiscal contains a full year of costs from the acquisition of check solutions in june in connection with software license and maintenance agreements entered into with certain banks and purchase agreements with vendors under which we acquired software technology used in products sold to our customers  we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain software products 
under these arrangements  we accrue royalty expense when the associated revenue is recognized 
the royalty percentages generally range from to of the associated revenue 
approximately million  million and million of royalty expense was recorded under these agreements in the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
depending on our future product mix  our margins from software license fees may be negatively impacted by increased software royalty expense 
write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties during the quarterly period ended july   in connection with our periodic impairment review of our portfolio of software products  the vault software acquired in the x port business combination in may was deemed to be impaired 
based on our calculation of the expected cash flows of the product  a million non cash charge was recorded 
the charge resulted from the loss of two key transactions and the projected changes in the approach to selling and delivering the software and related services under a time or usage model 
effective march   we entered into an alliance with exchange applications  inc xchange 
as part of this alliance we became the exclusive provider of the enact customer relationship software and methodology to the banking industry 
under the enact agreement  we became obligated for guaranteed royalty payments of million 
based on our periodic evaluation of the future cash flows associated with this product  a liability for the remaining million obligation was accrued at october   and the carrying value of the prepaid software royalties  at that time  of million was reduced to zero 
this resulted in a charge of million to costs of revenue during the quarterly period ended october  during december  we negotiated with xchange and received a commitment for  as a partial offset to expenses incurred to enhance and support the enact software for the existing customer base 
we reflected the  reimbursement as a ratable reduction in costs of revenue over the period november  through april  during the quarterly period ended january   in connection with our periodic impairment review of our portfolio of software products  the eimanager product acquired in the ais business combination in january was deemed to be impaired 
based on the company s calculation of the expected future cash flows of the product  a  non cash charge was recorded 
effective june  we entered into a software license agreement with actuate corporation in which the company would integrate actuate corporation s software with our global tracking and cash solutions within the global payments technologies business segment 
we prepaid  for copies of the software 
based on the expected sales forecasts of this product a  non cash charge was recorded in the quarterly period ended january  these costs are summarized below in thousands write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties year ended january  capitalized x port vault product costs  write off of prepaid software royalties with exchange applications  inc total recorded in the year ended january   year ended january  capitalized eimanager product costs write off of prepaid software royalties with actuate corporation

vs 
fy fy fy cost of software maintenance of software maintenance revenue cost of maintenance consists primarily of personnel and facility costs to provide telephone support  product defect support and other enhancements to our existing products which are not significant enough to extend the product s life cycle  or substantially increase its marketability 
these costs are primarily contained within our gpt business segment 
the increase in costs of maintenance in absolute dollars of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is the result of traditional research and development employees working on software development and enhancement projects classified as maintenance 
we expect these costs to decline slightly during the first three quarters of fiscal as we increase the amount of effort to develop new products and then return to normal levels as these products are completed and made generally available to our customers 
the increase in costs of maintenance in absolute dollars in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of our operations containing check solutions for the entire fiscal year 
the annual maintenance fee is generally paid by the customer at the beginning of the maintenance period and we recognize this maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the related contract 
if the annual maintenance fee is not paid at the beginning of the maintenance period  we defer revenue recognition until the time that the maintenance fee is paid by the customer 
when the payment is received  maintenance revenue is recognized for the period that maintenance revenue was previously deferred 
as a result  our cost of software maintenance as a percentage of related maintenance revenue will also fluctuate 
cost of software implementation in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy cost of software implementation of software implementation revenue costs of software implementation consist primarily of personnel and facility costs to provide software implementation and project management support to customer software implementations primarily within our gpt business segment 
the decline in costs of software implementation in absolute dollars of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily driven by a million decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the decline in new software license and implementation projects contracted and also the completion of an implementation project at the federal reserve 
the increase in the percentage of software implementation costs  as a percentage of software implementation revenue  is the result of the decline of software implementation revenue discussed above 
we anticipate that our costs of software implementation  as a percentage of software implementation revenue  to improve in fiscal with the majority of the improvement in the last half of the fiscal year 
the increase in costs of software implementation in absolute dollars of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is the result of our operations in fiscal containing a full year of costs derived from check solutions acquired in june out of pocket expenses in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy cost of out of pocket expenses of out of pocket expense reimbursements these costs represent travel  meals and other sundry expenses incurred by our employees 
these costs are invoiced to the customer  without mark up  usually on a monthly basis 
certain customer contracts do contain expense maximums  so in certain cases not all expenses incurred can be passed along to the customer 
operating costs and expenses in millions selling  general and administrative expenses in millions vs

fy fy fy selling  general and administrative expenses of total revenue selling  general and administrative expenses generally consist of personnel costs such as salaries  commissions and other incentive compensation along with travel associated with selling  marketing  general management and software management 
additionally  the provision for doubtful accounts  insurance  including directors and officers insurance  as well as professional services  such as legal and accounting expenses  and other related costs are classified within selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses have remained relatively flat for fiscal  and  and the fluctuation in the percent of total revenue was the result of fluctuations in total revenue 
in fiscal  we made strides to lower these costs through lower professional services approximately  and better accounts receivable management which reduced our bad debt charge approximately  however these cost savings were offset by increases in insurance costs approximately 
additionally  in fiscal  we formed carretek llc  a jointly owned company to offer financial institutions offshore centric outsourcing of their business processes and it needs 
carretek llc increased these costs by approximately  in fiscal in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year and selling  general and administrative costs attributed to check solutions increased to million from million in fiscal we have continued to control costs through reduced staffing levels  although these efforts have been offset by increases in professional services and also increased health insurance and directors and officers insurance 
we expect to continue to reduce our selling  general and administrative expense base in order to better align our cost structure with our current revenue levels 
however  these actions may be more than offset by increases in fiscal resulting from professional fees associated with our litigation  sarbanes oxley compliance and increases in our director and officer insurance for a full fiscal year 
research and development in millions vs 
vs 
fy fy fy research and development expenses of total revenue research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  contract labor  travel and facilities expenses incurred by our research and development organization 
in fiscal  research and development costs have decreased as compared to fiscal as a result of a concentration of projects classified as cost of software maintenance 
research and development costs are typically limited to development of new software products  or enhancements to existing software products  which extend the product s life cycle and or substantially increase its marketability 
in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer equipment to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalized million in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the majority of our capitalization is related to our first version of exchglink  our product offering to send and receive check images 
we expect this product to become generally available in the second or third quarter of fiscal we have several other development initiatives planned for fiscal such as the second version of exchglink  express research  an image enabled back office application  source capture which enables customers to capture check images at corporate sites  bank branches and atm s and an anti money laundering application 
considering these initiatives  we expect the amount of research and development costs to increase in fiscal the capitalization of checkflow services packs no 
and no 
was million in fiscal this version was never released due to our decision to no longer actively market the base checkflow product in july these costs were written off as a component of merger  restructuring and other charges in the second quarter of fiscal other capitalized research and development projects in fiscal consisted of million for icom  an enterprise wide cash inventory management tool and million related to four products within our fraud mitigation solution line 
software development costs of a product are capitalized from the time technological feasibility is reached until the general release of the product 
we establish technological feasibility through the process of creating a detailed program design and reviewing the detailed program design for any high risk development issues 
capitalization only occurs if we believe costs capitalized are recoverable through future sales of the software product under development 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization of goodwill and intangible assets was million in each of fiscal and  and decreased million from million in fiscal the amortization results from the periodic recognition of amortization expense of intangible customer relationships acquired in the check solutions acquisition 
the reduction in amortization of million was caused by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and no 
effective february  with the adoption of these standards  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles ceased to be amortized 
see further discussion in note and to our consolidated financial statements regarding the adoption of sfas no 
and no 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual evaluation for goodwill impairment resulting in a charge of million 
the impairment charge was recorded to the global payments technologies gpt segment as all of the company s goodwill has been assigned to the gpt segment 
the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned was determined to be less than its carrying amount 
thus  an allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit was made to determine the excess of fair value over amounts allocated to net assets 
the excess represents the estimated fair value of the goodwill which was compared to recorded goodwill as of the evaluation date of november  and resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the fair values used in this evaluation were estimated based upon the consideration of a number of fair value estimation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis and consideration of the market price of our stock 
the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue volume levels  price levels and rates of increases in operating expenses to compute projected cash flows for the reporting unit and other intangible assets within the reporting unit 
a discount rate of was applied to determine discounted cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual evaluation for goodwill impairment 
no impairment resulted from this assessment 
we believe that our assumptions used to estimate future cash flows for this evaluation are reasonable 
however  if market conditions deteriorate or if changes occur in the estimated projections with respect to gpt business  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in fiscal  the amount of which could be material to our results of operations

included in this charge was million of cash termination benefits associated with the separation of employees 
most of the affected employees left their positions during the quarterly period ended october  after an extensive review of the checkflow suite product line  management determined that the checkflow suite was no longer viable in the market in the form originally developed 
we developed the checkflow suite with pegasystems  inc pega under a product development  distribution and sublicensing agreement effective may  the agreement 
pega filed suit to restrain us from developing  marketing  licensing  advertising  leasing  or selling any products  including certain back office products acquired during the check solutions business combination  that allegedly competed with the products jointly developed under the agreement 
the charges related to the discontinuance of the checkflow suite and the estimated settlement with pega  as of july   were as follows in thousands write off of capitalized software costs  settlements and estimated implementation costs for existing checkflow customer  write off of prepaid royalties previously paid to pega estimated settlement with pega  total  in connection with the check solutions acquisition  a million in process research and development charge was recorded reflecting the estimated fair value of acquired research and development projects at check solutions  which have not yet reached technological feasibility 
included in the merger  restructuring and other charges recorded is a facility closure charge of  for office space  which would no longer be utilized 
on october   the delaware chancery court granted pega s motion for preliminary injunction 
on november   all matters relating to various legal and administrative actions surrounding this dispute were settled 
under this settlement agreement  we agreed to pay settlement and legal costs totaling million of which million was accrued at july   which includes royalties on prior period sales of the four back office products 
consistent with the prior agreement  we will continue to pay pega royalties based on future sales of the four back office products through october  the resulting settlement and legal costs incurred in excess of the initial million accrual recorded in the period ended july  were recorded as a component of merger  restructuring and other charges in the quarterly period ended october  during the quarterly period ended january   we implemented a reduction in the workforce to adjust staffing levels to a level sufficient to support projected business activities 
primarily  as a result of the reductions approximately employees were terminated and a charge of million  related to severance costs including the termination of the agreement with the former owner of x port  and an additional  for facility closures and  of additional charges related to the checkflow suite 
fiscal year ended january  during the quarterly period ended january   we recorded a charge of  relating to a reduction in the workforce for employees that were terminated 
additionally  we recorded a charge for approximately million for legal and professional fees related to the special investigation and restatement efforts 
fiscal year ended january  we recorded  in restructuring and other charges during the three month period ended april   principally associated with the separation of employees  within both the corporate and global payments consulting gpc business segments

during the quarterly period ended july   we recorded a charge of  relating to legal fees relating to the shareholder legal actions described in note as part of our settlement with one of the checkflow suite customers  the customer agreed to pay us for the replacement product and installation 
these payments are recorded directly to this reserve and all future expenditures to install the replacement product will be charged against this reserve 
during the quarterly period ended july    was received from this customer 
we recorded  in restructuring and other charges during the three month period ended october   principally associated with the separation of employees  within the corporate business segment 
during the quarterly period ended october   we recorded a charge of  relating to legal fees relating to the shareholder legal actions described in note additionally  during the three months ended october   we reversed  primarily related to the true up of termination benefits as actual costs were lower than estimated amounts 
additionally   was reversed when estimated costs to close certain facilities were lower than our original estimates 
the effect of these revisions in estimates  net of tax  was per share on a fully diluted basis  for the year ended january  we recorded  of restructuring and other charges during the three months ended january   principally associated with the separation of employees 
we also discontinued the marketing of one of our software offerings and recorded a  charge 
finally  we recorded a charge of  relating to legal fees related to the shareholder legal actions described in note the activity related to the accrued merger and restructuring charge reserve balance during the years ended january   and is as follows in thousands workforce reductions charges relating to checkflow suite facility closures other total reserve balance at january  additions to reserve balance merger  restructuring and other charges   reductions to reserve balances cash paid    non cash charges against reserve   reserve balance at january    additions to reserve balance merger  restructuring and other charges reductions to reserve balances cash paid    reserve balance at january    additions to reserve balance severance charges   discontinuation of software product cash received from customer reductions to reserve balances change in estimate cash paid   reserve balance at january    other income expense interest income consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and decreased from million in fiscal the decreases primarily result from lower interest rates and lower average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances resulting from the use of million of cash and short term investments to fund the check solutions acquisition in june interest expense is primarily the result of borrowings used to fund the check solutions acquisition in june interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal the decline in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in debt in fiscal and lower average interest rates 
a full year of interest expense on long term borrowings associated with financing a portion of the check solutions acquisition is reflected in fiscal as compared to just eight months in fiscal this increase was partially offset by lower interest rates and the reduction of million on the revolving credit agreement during fiscal other income expense is comprised of our share of income and expense in both our investments in cash services australia pty ltd 
and carretek llc  along with foreign exchange gains and losses 
in fiscal  the increase was primarily the result of the  recorded as minority interest in the net loss of carretek llc operations 
in fiscal  the increase was the result of a  foreign exchange gain as compared to a  foreign exchange loss in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate  and includes federal  state and foreign income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to net operating losses offsetting the taxable income generated 
the lower tax rates in fiscal and were due to losses we incurred from which we have not yet obtained a tax benefit 
for us to realize the benefit of our net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax assets recorded as of january   we must generate future taxable income 
due to significant losses incurred in both fiscal and  we concluded that the more likely than not criteria required for recognition of deferred tax assets under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes was not met at both january  and thus  a valuation allowance was recorded in both fiscal and to fully reserve the net deferred tax assets which resulted in the unbenefitted losses 
on march   the federal tax law changed to allow net operating losses for taxable years ended in and to be carried back an additional three years 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 the impact of this change in tax law and related five year carryback was not used in the determination of the company s tax provision and related deferred tax valuation allowance for the year ended january  the impact from this change in tax law  including any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the expanded carryback period  was reflected in our tax provision for the quarterly period ended april  this resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million in fiscal which was partially offset by state and foreign taxes 
at january   we had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in selected consolidated quarterly results of operations unaudited the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly data for each of our last eight quarters ended january  we believe all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations of the company have been made

these assets are subject to annual impairment tests

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations and cash expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
at january   we had working capital of million compared to million at january  we had million in cash and cash equivalents at january   an increase of million from million in cash and cash equivalents at january  at january   we had million of long term debt compared to million at january  we expect that existing cash and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal and cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal operating cash flows increased during the fiscal primarily as a result of increased maintenance invoice collections 
the increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily reflected our efforts to reduce headcount 
this increase was offset by the payment of incentive compensation to both current and former check solutions employees 
average days sales outstanding fluctuate for a variety of reasons  including the timing of billings specified by contractual agreement  and receivables for expense reimbursements 
the following table contains the quarterly days sales outstanding dso quarter ended dso january  october  july  april  january  cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to million of routine purchases of property and equipment along with million of capitalized software costs and a million purchase of acquired developed software related to an anti money laundering product 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to the purchases of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to the acquisition of check solutions company 
we expect purchases of property and equipment to increase in fiscal as we replace certain developmental hardware and software within our technology group based in charlotte  nc 
we believe that capitalized software development costs will increase in fiscal financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  and used cash of million in fiscal and provided cash of million in fiscal the cash used in financing activities in fiscal was comprised of million of payments on our revolving credit agreement offset by million of stock option exercise proceeds 
in addition  we incurred  of deferred loan costs when the revolving credit agreement was amended in july the cash used in financing activities during fiscal was comprised of million of payments on our revolving credit agreement offset by million of stock option proceeds and proceeds from a private placement of our common stock on april  the net proceeds from the private placement of million were used to satisfy obligations due certain employees of check solutions of approximately million with the remainder used for working capital 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from million drawn on our revolving credit agreement entered into to partially fund the check solutions acquisition 
on june   we entered into a three year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks in an amount not to exceed million to fund the acquisition of check solutions 
on july   the revolving credit agreement was amended to reduce the commitment amount to million  and to extend the maturity date of the outstanding borrowings to july  at january  and  we had outstanding borrowings of million and million  respectively  under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement currently bear interest equal to either the greater of prime or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from to depending on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  or london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin equal to to depending on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
interest payments are due quarterly 
we are required to pay a commitment fee equal to on the unused amount of the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  some of which have been amended  including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified interest coverage  ratio of ebitda to funded debt  and ratio of of accounts receivable  cash and short term investments to funded debt 
additionally  the payment of dividends is precluded subject to the approval of the banks 
substantially all of our assets collateralize this revolving credit agreement 
as of january   we are in compliance with the covenants of the revolving credit agreement  as amended 
any instances of non compliance could negatively impact our liquidity 
in february  we paid down the remaining million outstanding under this agreement 
at january   we had material commitments for our operating leases  as described in note in our notes to consolidated financial statements  including commitments of approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to be higher than fiscal as we replace certain developmental hardware and software within our technology group based in charlotte  nc 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january  and the effect these contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total year or less years years after years revolving credit agreement operating leases on april   we sold  shares of our common stock to a group of investors in a private transaction 
we utilized the approximately million of net proceeds that were received from the sale to satisfy existing obligations due to certain former employees of check solutions  with the remainder being used for working capital 
see note in notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current cash balances and expected future cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities during fiscal however  if current sources are not sufficient to meet our needs  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the company is presently involved in a number of lawsuits  including several class action lawsuits 
the outcomes or resolutions of the lawsuits are unknown  but could include judgments against us  or settlements that could require substantial payments by us 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the timing of the final resolution of these matters is uncertain 
we believe that a material adverse outcome or outcomes with respect to the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial results  our business or our management  including but not limited to  significantly impacting our liquidity in a negative manner as well as causing covenant violations under our revolving credit agreement  possibly resulting in a default thereunder 
further  we may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that could complement or expand our business and product offerings  and could change our financing needs 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
the failure to secure additional financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and our estimates may vary from actual results 
we consider the following seven accounting policies the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ  and such differences could be significant to our financial results 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of software  or the license agreement requires the company to provide implementation services that are determined to be essential to other elements of the arrangement  the company follows the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
consulting fees 
we employ three primary pricing methods in connection with our delivery of consulting services 
first  we may price our delivery of consulting services on the basis of time and materials  in which case the customer is charged agreed upon daily rates for services performed and out of pocket expenses 
in this case  we are generally paid fees and related amounts on a monthly basis  and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
second  we may deliver consulting services on a fixed price basis 
in this case  we are generally paid on a monthly basis or pursuant to an agreed upon payment schedule  and we recognize revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
we believe that this method is appropriate because of our ability to determine performance milestones and determine dependable estimates of our costs applicable to each phase of a contract 
because financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contract  costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses 
anticipated losses on fixed priced contracts are recognized when estimable 
third  we may deliver consulting services pursuant to a value priced contract with the customer 
in this case  we are paid  on an agreed upon basis with the customer  either a specified percentage of the projected increased revenues and or decreased costs that are expected to be derived by the customer generally over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution or the actual increased revenues and or decreased costs experienced by the customer generally over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution  subject in either case to a maximum  if any is agreed to  on the total amount of payments to be made to us 
we must first commit time and resources to develop projections associated with value pricing contracts before a bank will commit to purchase our solutions  and we therefore assume the risk of making these commitments with no assurance that the bank will purchase the solution 
costs associated with these value pricing contracts are expensed as incurred 
these contracts typically include payments to be made to us pursuant to an agreed upon schedule ranging from one to twelve months in length 
we recognize revenues generated from consulting services in connection with value priced contracts based upon projected results only upon completion of all services and agreement upon the actual fee to be paid even though billings for these services may be delayed by mutual agreement for periods not to exceed twelve months 
in an effort to allow customers to more closely match expected benefits from our services with payments to us  we may on occasion  offer payment terms which extend beyond months 
when we enter into an agreement that has a significant component of the total amount payable under the agreement due beyond months or if it is determined payments are not fixed and determinable at the date the agreement is entered into  revenue under the arrangement will be recognized as payments become due and payable 
when fees are to be paid based on a percentage of actual revenues and or savings to our customers  we recognize revenues only upon completion of all services and as the amounts of actual revenues or savings are confirmed by the customer with a fixed payment date 
costs associated with time and materials  fixed priced and value priced consulting fee arrangements are expensed as incurred and are included as a component of the cost of consulting fees 
we expect that value priced contracts will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
as a consequence of the use of value priced contracts and due to the revenue recognition policy associated with those contracts  our results of operations will likely fluctuate significantly from period to period 
regardless of the pricing method employed by us in a given contract  we are typically reimbursed on a monthly basis for out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of our customers 
software license fees 
a software license is sold either together with implementation services or on a stand alone basis 
we are usually paid software license fees in one or more installments  as provided in the customer s contract but not to exceed months 
we recognize software license revenue upon execution of a contract and delivery of the software  provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable  no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and collection is considered probable by management 
when the software license arrangement requires us to provide implementation services that are essential to the functionality of the software or significant production  customization or modification of the software is required  both the product license revenue and implementation fees are recognized as services are performed 
in certain instances  especially with recently developed software  we defer software revenue recognition until the services are completed and the project is accepted by the customer 
software licenses are often sold as part of a multiple element arrangement that may include maintenance  implementation or consulting 
we determine whether there is vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoefv for each element identified in the arrangement to determine whether the total arrangement fees can be allocated to each element 
if vsoefv exists for each element  the total arrangement fee is allocated based on the relative fair value of each element 
in cases where there is not vsoefv for each element  or if it is determined services are essential to the functionality of the software being delivered  or if significant production  modification or customization of the software is required  we defer revenue recognition of the software license fees 
however  if vsoefv is determinable for all of the undelivered elements  and assuming the undelivered elements are not essential to the delivered elements  we will defer recognition of the full fair value related to the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining portion of the arrangement value through application of the residual method 
where vsoefv has not been established for certain undelivered elements  revenue for all elements is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their fair values have been determined 
evidence of vsoefv is determined for software products based on actual sales prices for the product sold to a similar class of customer and based on pricing strategies set forth in our price book 
evidence of vsoefv for services installation  implementation and consulting is based upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for individuals expected to perform the related services 
we establish vsoefv for maintenance agreements using the percentage method such that vsoefv for maintenance is a percentage of the license fee charged annually for specific software product  which in most instances is of the portion of arrangement fees allocated to the software license element 
although substantially all of our current software licenses provide for a fixed price license fee  some licenses provide for the customer to pay a monthly license fee based on the actual use of the software product 
the level of license fees earned by us under this arrangement will vary based on the actual amount of use by the customer 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized on a monthly basis as the usage becomes determinable 
software maintenance fees 
in connection with our sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software maintenance services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software maintenance services  which typically are renewed annually 
we charge an annual maintenance fee  which is typically a percentage of the initial software license fee 
the annual maintenance fee generally is paid to us at the beginning of the maintenance period  and we recognize these revenues ratably over the term of the related contract 
if the annual maintenance fee is not paid at the beginning of the maintenance period  we defer revenue recognition until the time that the maintenance fee is paid by the customer 
we normally continue to provide maintenance service while awaiting payment from customers 
when the payment is received  revenue is recognized for the period that revenue was previously deferred 
this may result in volatility in software maintenance revenue from period to period 
software implementation fees 
in connection with the sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software implementation services  including software enhancements and other software services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software implementation services 
we price our implementation services on a time and material or on a fixed price basis  and we recognize the related revenues as services are performed 
costs associated with these engagements are expensed as incurred 
our contracts typically do not include right of return clauses  and as a result  we do not record a provision for returns 
royalties in connection with software license and maintenance agreements entered into with certain banks and purchase agreements with vendors under which we acquired software technology used in products sold to its customers  we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain software products 
under these arrangements  we accrue royalty expense when the associated revenue is recognized 
for current product offerings  the royalty percentages generally range from of the associated revenues 
royalty expense is included as a component of the cost of software license fees and cost of software maintenance fees in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts a large proportion of our revenues and receivables are attributable to our customers in the banking industry 
our trade accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from our customers 
because our accounts receivable are typically unsecured  we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our accounts based on a combination of factors  including a particular customer s ability to pay as well as the age of receivables 
in cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us or if the collection of the receivable becomes doubtful due to a dispute that arises subsequent to the delivery of our products and services  we set up a specific reserve in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
software costs capitalized  goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets software costs capitalized include developed technology acquired in acquisitions and costs incurred by us in developing our products that qualify for capitalization 
we capitalize our software development costs  other than costs for internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
our policy is to capitalize software development costs incurred in developing a product once technological feasibility of the product has been established 
software development costs capitalized also include amounts paid for purchased software on products that have reached technological feasibility 
technological feasibility of the product is determined after completion of a detailed program design and a determination has been made that any uncertainties related to high risk development issues have been resolved 
if the process of developing the product does not include a detailed program design  technological feasibility is determined only after completion of a working model 
all capitalized software development costs are amortized using an amount determined as the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a capitalized software project bears to the total of current and future projected gross revenues for that project or the straight line method over the remaining economic life of the product generally three to six years 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are assessed on an annual basis for impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
we performed the initial impairment test of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives assets at february  and a follow up test at november  to determine if an impairment charge should be recognized under sfas the initial impairment analysis did not result in any write down of capitalized costs 
we perform an annual impairment assessment on november st of each year or when factors indicate that other long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows over the remaining life of the asset to determine if impairment has occurred 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent from other asset groups 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset is assessed when the undiscounted  expected future operating cash flows derived from the asset are less than its carrying value 
management believes that assumptions used to determine cash flows are reasonable  but actual future cash flows may differ from those estimated 
if we determine an asset has been impaired  the impairment is recorded based on the estimated fair value of the impaired asset 
during the period ended january   events and circumstances caused us to revaluate goodwill resulting in an impairment charge of million 
during the fourth quarter of the year ended january   we performed our annual evaluation for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired 
goodwill at january  totaled million 
any deterioration in market conditions  increases in interest rates and changes in our projections with respect to the global payments technologies reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated would result in additional impairment charges in the future 
restructuring and other charges during fiscal year  we recorded reserves in connection with our acquisition of check solutions and subsequent operational restructurings 
additional reserves were recorded during fiscal and these reserves contain significant estimates pertaining to work force reductions  and the settlement of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although we do not anticipate any significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments of outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount or reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in insurance coverage or approach such as change in settlement strategy 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of our cumulative net losses we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance of any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for reorganization and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing any future reorganization costs as well as the amount recognized 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
it also addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early application permitted 
companies may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 

the adoption of eitf did not have a significant impact on our accounting for multiple element arrangements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee or indemnification 
fin also requires additional disclosure by a guarantor in its interim and annual consolidated financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and indemnifications 
the following is a summary of the agreements that we have determined are within the scope of fin under the terms of the majority of our software license agreements with our customers  we agree that in the event the software sold infringes upon any patent  copyright  trademark  or any other proprietary right of a third party  we will indemnify our customer licenses  against any loss  expense  or liability from any damages that may be awarded against our customer 
we include this infringement indemnification in all of our software license agreements 
in the event the customer cannot use the software or service due to infringement and we cannot obtain the right to use  replace or modify the license or service in a commercially feasible manner so that it no longer infringes then we may terminate the license and provide the customer pro rata refund of the fees paid by the customer for the infringing license or service 
we have not recorded any liabilities associated with this indemnification  as we are not aware of any pending or threatened infringement actions that are probable losses 
we believe the estimated fair value of these intellectual property indemnification clauses is minimal 
we have agreed to indemnify members of the board of directors  as well as officers of carreker corporation  if they are made a party or are threatened to be made a party to any proceeding other than an action by or in the right of carreker corporation by reason of the fact that they are an agent of ours  or by reason of anything done or not done by them in any such capacity 
the indemnity is for any and all expenses and liabilities of any type whatsoever including but not limited to  judgments  fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the directors or officers in connection with the investigation  defense  settlement or appeal of such proceeding  provided they acted in good faith 
we maintain insurance coverage for directors and officers liability d o insurance 
no maximum liability is stipulated in these agreements that include indemnifications of members or the board of directors and officers of carreker corporation 
we have not recorded any liability associated with these indemnifications as we are not aware of any pending or threatened actions or claims against our board of directors or officers that are probable losses in excess of amounts covered our its d o insurance 
as a result of the insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements are minimal 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
fin that requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack specified characteristics 
fin was effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and is applicable for all variable interest entities  regardless of the date of creation  for the first reporting period ending after march  we expect to adopt the provisions of fin as of april  the effect of adopting the provisions of fin is not expected to be material to our financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and maintained with nationally recognized financial institutions  and mutual fund companies 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
we treat all of our cash equivalents and short term investments as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading 
at january   we did not hold any fixed rate investments 
we had million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement at january  although  this remaining balance was paid in february as described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  the interest rate under the revolving credit agreement is variable 
at january   the interest rate of the debt was 
foreign currency risk we currently have sales and marketing operations in several international locations including canada  united kingdom  south africa and australia 
as a result  we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
due to the nature of these operations  we currently utilize the us dollar as the functional currency for all international operations 
an insignificant portion of our accounts receivable balance at january   was denominated in a foreign currency 
our exposure to adverse movements to foreign exchange rates is not significant 
therefore  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure  however  we do try to limit our foreign currency exposure by negotiating these foreign contracts in us dollars 
we will continue to evaluate the need to adopt a hedge strategy in the future and may implement a formal strategy if our business transacted in foreign currencies increases 
foreign exchange gains were  and  in the years ended january  and  respectively 
foreign exchange losses were  in the year ended january
