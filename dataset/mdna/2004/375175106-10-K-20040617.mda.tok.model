item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition management s discussion and analysis overview giga tronics produces instruments  subsystems and sophisticated microwave components that have broad applications in both defense electronics and wireless telecommunications 
in our business consisted of four operating and reporting segments giga tronics instrument division  ascor  microsource and corporate 
our business is highly dependent on the wireless telecommunications market 
the commercial business environment was challenging in the first two quarters of  however in the last half of  giga tronics experienced improvements in new orders 
inquiries for giga tronics products  including the new series synthesizer were also higher in the last two quarters 
new orders in the military sector are showing indications of increased strength  however it is still too early to determine if the commercial wireless telecommunications market has rebounded 
the company s cost reduction programs  including reductions in personnel and new lease terms  are on track and have positioned giga tronics to take advantage of any potential opportunities in our market 
if new orders should decrease or are canceled  cash may be used faster than currently anticipated 
management would anticipate further cost and expense reductions in this circumstance 
the company has recently released a new line of microwave synthesizers that management believes have been well received in the marketplace 
this release demonstrates the company s commitment to new product development 
giga tronics intends to continue research and development in key growth areas in order to expand product lines and update existing lines with additional features 
while the management at microsource anticipates that prospects for new orders will improve results for the new fiscal year  its short term growth will be less than previously anticipated as there continue to be timing delays associated with currently booked orders

critical accounting estimates management of giga tronics has identified the following as the company s critical accounting policies revenue revenues are recognized when there is evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
this generally occurs when products are shipped and the risk of loss has passed 
upon shipment  the company also provides for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranties 
revenue related to products shipped subject to customers evaluation is recognized upon final acceptance 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company periodically reviews inventory on hand to identify and write down excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated product demand 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the net realizable value 
the company has estimated an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on analysis of outstanding receivables  consideration of the age of those receivables  and the company s historical collection experience 
deferred tax assets the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets  which may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets become deductible  management believes it more likely than not that the company will not realize benefits of these deductible differences as of march  management has  therefore  established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as of march  product development costs the company incurs pre production costs on certain long term supply arrangements 
the costs  which represent non recurring engineering and tooling costs  are capitalized as other assets and amortized over their useful life when reimbursable by the customer 
otherwise  they are expensed as incurred

cash used by operations amounted to  in and  in cash provided by operations amounted to  in cash used by operations in is primarily attributed to the operating loss in the year and a decrease in customer advances offset by depreciation and amortization expenses that are non cash items and decreases in net accounts receivable and net inventories 
cash used by operations in was primarily attributed to the operating loss in the year offset by non cash depreciation and amortization expenses  an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operations in was attributed to accounts receivable collections  reduced inventory purchases and non cash depreciation and amortization expenses offset by the operating loss in the year  and the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
based on current operations  management believes that cash and cash equivalents remain adequate to meet anticipated operating needs for the next two years 
however  this estimate is based on projections that may or may not be realized  therefore actual cash usage could be greater than projected 
to operate beyond that term would require the company to earn additional cash from operations  obtain a line of credit or obtain additional funds from other sources
