item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including item business  item selected financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data 
the various sections of this md a contain a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing 
our actual results may differ materially 
our industry our industry is affected by a number of factors that influence its size and development 
these factors include the availability of genomic sequence data for human and other organisms  technological innovation that increases throughput and lowers the cost of genomic and genetic analysis  the development of new computational techniques to handle and analyze large amounts of genomic data  the availability of government funding for basic and disease related research  the amount of capital and ongoing expenditures allocated to research and development spending by biotechnology and pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies  the application of genomics to new areas including clinical diagnostics  agriculture  human identity and consumer goods  and the availability of genetic markers and signatures of diagnostic value 
our business and financial results we have established our genechip system as the platform of choice for acquiring  analyzing and managing complex genetic information 
our integrated genechip platform includes disposable dna probe arrays chips consisting of gene sequences set out in an ordered  high density pattern  certain reagents for use with the probe arrays  a scanner and other instruments used to process the probe arrays  and software to analyze and manage genomic information obtained from the probe arrays 
we currently sell our products directly to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agrichemical  diagnostics and consumer products companies as well as academic research centers  government research laboratories  private foundation laboratories and clinical reference laboratories in north america  europe and japan 
we also sell our products through life science supply specialists acting as authorized distributors in the middle east  india and asia pacific regions 
prior to the year ended december   we incurred losses each year since our inception  and as a result have an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing and from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations  including the costs of patent related litigation 
these costs have historically exceeded our revenues and interest income  which to date have been generated principally from product sales  product related revenue  technology access and other license fees  royalties  collaborative research and development agreements  and from interest earned on cash and investment balances 
our financial results are substantially dependent on our ability to generate significant revenues and maintain profitability 
revenues are impacted principally by our ability to expand our customer base and increase sales of our products to new and existing customers  and by the price of product sales  royalties  design and license fees 
to maintain or gain market acceptance of our products in the face of the introduction of new products by our competitors  we may have to reduce or discount the price of our products resulting in an adverse impact on revenues and gross margins 
in addition to the above  our ability to enter into additional supply  license and collaborative arrangements and our ability and that of our collaborative partners to successfully manufacture and commercialize products incorporating our technologies in new applications and in new markets will also impact our revenue and profitability 
our expenses are impacted principally by the cost of goods for products  the magnitude and duration of research and development  sales and marketing costs  and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses are particularly subject to variation as a result of fluctuations in the intensity of legal activities 
our operating results may also fluctuate significantly depending on other factors which include the outcome of ongoing or future litigation  the need for additional royalty bearing licenses  adoption of new technologies  the cost  quality and availability of reagents and components  regulatory actions  and third party reimbursement policies 
company outlook in general  as management looks ahead to  the outlook for our company continues to be favorable for a number of reasons 
we anticipate that continued improvements in access to capital markets will favorably influence sales in the biotech arena  that the current regulatory market appears poised to leverage genetic information tools to improve the approval process for new drugs  and that we will see continued standardization on our technology platform for both existing and new applications 
although it is difficult to predict product demand in  we expect continued growth in the total number of probe array and related supply sales as the number of experiments on genechip technology continues to grow 
additionally  due to the strong adoption of our new line of dna analysis products in the second half of  we anticipate that these products will make a meaningful contribution to our array growth in management also expects that we will continue to demonstrate strong operational leverage as we grow into our infrastructure 
going forward  management is focused on growing the business and increasing its profitability 
a key driver will be increasing the breadth of scientific and clinical applications of our technology  while also industrializing  automating and standardizing our technology to open new markets and drive revenue growth 
the aim of our automation efforts is to reduce the cost per experiment  minimize operator variability and dramatically improve experimental throughput 
we believe that our automation solutions will enjoy the same success in the high throughput markets as our bench top systems have in the research markets 
in addition  we are industrializing our processes through collaborations with industry leaders such as beckman coulter  caliper life sciences and others 
critical accounting policies estimates general the following section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into contracts to sell our products and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverable elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and  when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record specific bad debt reserves to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt on a small portion of all other customer balances based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventories we enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products 
the business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  product expiration and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods  when appropriate  in order to report inventory at net realizable value 
revisions to our inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand  component costs  supplier arrangements  or product life cycles differ from our estimates 
accounting for acquired technology rights our intangible assets are comprised principally of technology rights 
we apply judgment in determining the useful lives of our intangible assets and whether such assets are impaired 
factors we consider include the life of the underlying patent  the existence of competing technology and potential obsolescence  which can all adversely impact the expected period of benefit from the use of the technology 
to date  we have not experienced any impairment on our intangible assets 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
any reserves recorded may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
results of operations f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
in january  we expanded our collaboration with roche by granting roche access to our genechip technologies to develop and commercialize genechip laboratory tests for dna analysis  genotyping and resequencing applications  as well as for rna expression analysis  in a broad range of human disease areas 
using our genechip technologies  roche is seeking to develop and market tests for diseases such as cancer  osteoporosis  cardiovascular  metabolic  infectious and inflammatory diseases 
under the terms of the collaborative agreement  roche paid us an up front  nonrefundable license fee of million 
we are recognizing this amount as a component of product related revenue over the research and product development phase which is expected to approximate five years 
the agreement  which is subject to roche s option to terminate on december  or any time on or after june   with one year s prior notice  includes a broad range of other compensation payable by roche to us throughout the life of the agreement based on minimum annual royalties on sales of diagnostic kits  milestone payments for technical and commercial achievements  a manufacturing and supply agreement  and related license installments 
perlegen sciences  inc on january   we entered into an agreement with perlegen to license certain perlegen technologies that are expected to accelerate our plan to design and commercialize microarrays for whole genome and candidate region dna analysis 
in addition to broadening our access to perlegen technologies  this licensing agreement advances by approximately three years our prior commercialization rights to the perlegen single nucleotide polymorphism snp database for development of chip based products 
under the terms of the licensing agreement  we paid perlegen a total of million in cash and granted perlegen a million credit which will be applied against the margin on our future sales of chips to perlegen 
the credit can only be used against the margin on chips that are utilized by perlegen for revenue generating activities 
as of december   perlegen has used approximately million of the credit 
this credit expires in three years 
this new agreement also eliminates any future royalty obligations for array products that we commercialize based on information contained in perlegen s snp database 
we engaged an independent third party to conduct a valuation analysis of the licenses acquired 
based upon that independent valuation  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to in process research and development in the first quarter of the remaining million has been recorded as an intangible asset and will be amortized over the useful lives of the various components of the asset ranging from six to ten years 
on january   perlegen announced that it completed the first closing of a private financing round raising an aggregate of approximately million 
as a result of this financing  our collective equity ownership in perlegen including that of our affiliates was reduced to less than  and a previously existing voting trust applicable to a portion of our shares was terminated 
in december  we sold  shares of perlegen reducing our collective equity ownership in perlegen including that of our affiliates 
we continue to account for our ownership in perlegen under the equity method see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue certain amounts in and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation  exclusive of revenue from perlegen 
product sales the components of product sales are as follows in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from probe arrays and related supplies    instruments     total product sales     total product sales increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to growth in instrument revenue 
the new genechip scanner and genechip fluidics station were launched in the first half of fiscal year  resulting in an increasing number of customer instrument upgrades throughout the year 
unit sales of genechip related supplies also increased during the year as a result of an expanded product offering in the third quarter and overall increased product acceptance 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in unit sales of our full genechip instrument systems for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overall  both the average selling price and the number of units of our genechip probe arrays remained relatively consistent with those in  with the inclusion of the transition of our flagship human chip product from a two chip set to one chip 
total product sales increased to million in  from million in the increase was primarily due to growth in unit sales and an increase in the average sales price of genechip probe arrays and related supplies 
revenue from sales of probe arrays and related supplies increased to million in  up million from million in revenue from the sale of instruments remained relatively consistent increasing from million in to million in product related revenue the components of product related revenue are as follows in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from subscription fees      service and other      license fees and milestone revenue   total product related revenue     total product related revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in product related revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in license fees of million earned in connection with the roche agreement signed in january  an increase in service revenue associated with the continued growth in our installed base of equipment and the inclusion of custom probe array design fees of million in as a result of the full commercialization of our custom product offering 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in software revenue and a decrease in subscription fees earned under our easyaccess agreements as we transition customers to volume based discounting on product sales 
revenues from custom probe array design fees of million are reported in royalties and other revenue in for the year ended december   product and product related revenue decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decline in subscription fees earned under our easyaccess agreements and due to fewer new software agreements being signed during the year 
this was offset to some extent by an increase in service revenue  primarily due to the continued growth in our installed base of equipment 
royalty and other revenue in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from royalties and other revenue     royalty and other revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline was primarily due to the reporting of custom probe array design fees as product related revenue beginning in january  as a result of the full commercialization of our custom product offering and due to the decline in new license agreements and royalties  as customers moved from licensing our non core spotting technology to purchasing our genechip probe arrays 
in addition  in the second quarter of  we recognized approximately million of deferred revenue related to the early completion of a long term contractual arrangement under which we had no further obligations 
the decrease was partially offset by increased research activity related to an existing grant 
royalty and other revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher design fees earned during fiscal partially offset by a decrease in royalty fees as companies began to purchase our genechip probe arrays rather than manufacturing their own arrays 
revenue from perlegen sciences  inc 
in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from revenue from perlegen sciences     revenue from the sale of wafers to perlegen  a related party  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decline was consistent with the decrease in perlegen s contractual obligations to the company 
revenue from the sale of wafers to perlegen  a related party  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a number of factors 
first  there were additional sales of wafers to perlegen during second  perlegen was our wholly owned subsidiary until march  and therefore  its activities in the first quarter of were consolidated into our financial results 
lastly  when perlegen uses the wafers or arrays supplied by us in commercial activities for the benefit of third parties  then perlegen is obligated to make additional payments for such wafers so that we receive commercial margins on these wafers 
we recognized a gross margin of million in related to payments for such wafers 
the revenue associated with the margin on third party activities represented approximately of the total revenue received from perlegen 
product and product related gross margins in thousands  except percentage amounts for the years ended december  dollar percentage change from total gross margin on product sales    total gross margin on product related revenue   total gross margin on product and product related revenue  product gross margin as a percentage of product sales product related gross margin as a percentage of product related revenue total gross margin on product sales improved to in from in the increase was primarily due to higher gross margins on instruments resulting from higher average selling prices and a lower cost of production associated with the internal manufacturing of the genechip scanner  as the company transitioned from the genearray scanner which was manufactured for us under a supply agreement 
the transition to internal manufacturing resulted in increased production volume in our bedford facility 
gross margins on probe arrays were also slightly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of lower production costs per unit due to increased manufacturing efficiencies 
gross margin on product related revenue decreased by to for the year ended december  due to the inclusion of costs associated with our custom probe array design fees beginning in january as a result of the full commercialization of our custom product offering  as well as a decrease in software revenue and subscription fees 
the impact on margins from the decrease in software revenue and subscription fees were partially offset by an increase in license revenue from the roche agreement signed in january total gross margins on product sales improved to in  up from in principal factors that favorably impacted gross margins included favorable changes in product sales mix  increased production volumes of for probe arrays resulting in improved overhead absorption  and improved probe array manufacturing yields 
total gross margins on product related revenue decreased by from to for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to a decline in our subscription fees in cost of perlegen revenues in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from cost of revenue from perlegen sciences    pursuant to a supply agreement with perlegen  we sell whole wafers to perlegen for use in perlegen s research and development activities at our fully burdened cost of manufacturing 
cost of perlegen revenue decreased to approximately million in from million in the decrease in the cost of perlegen revenue is related to the reduction in perlegen revenue  both of which are declining as perlegen s contractual obligations to purchase wafers decreases 
cost of perlegen revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was due to increased sales of wafers to perlegen during fiscal in addition  perlegen was a wholly owned subsidiary of affymetrix until march  and therefore  its activities in the first quarter of were consolidated into our financial results 
research and development expenses in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from research and development     research and development expenses  which primarily consist of basic research  product research and development and manufacturing process and development  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to the reporting of costs associated with custom probe array design fees as cost of product related revenue starting in january as a result of the full commercialization of our custom product offering and the decrease in product development costs associated with the release of two genechip instrument systems 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in r d consulting fees 
in and in prior years  costs of custom probe array design fees were reported as research and development expense 
costs of custom probe array design fees were million for the year ended december  research and development expenses  increased to million in  up from million in in  research and development expenses included million of expenses associated with perlegen that are not included in excluding the expenses related to perlegen in fiscal  the increase in was primarily due to expanded investments in basic research as well as in the development costs associated with our new genechip scanner we believe a substantial investment in research and development is essential to a long term sustainable competitive advantage and critical to expansion into additional high throughput markets such as toxicogenomics  pharmacogenomics and clinical applications 
we expect research and development spending to increase as basic research and product research and development efforts continue to expand 
selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from selling  general and administrative    selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to an increased investment in our sales and support infrastructure in japan and europe  and an increase in general legal expenses related to our current litigation 
these increases were partially offset by the recovery of a million account receivable that was reserved for in the second half of for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million up from in the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of million related to increased investments in the worldwide sales  marketing  technical support  and administrative infrastructures 
specifically in  we significantly expanded our european operations and began to establish our sales and support infrastructure in japan 
this growth in spending was partially offset by a decrease of million in legal expense as the result of settlement of litigation 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase as we expand sales  marketing  and technical support functions  management and administrative functions  prosecute and defend our intellectual property position and defend against claims made by third parties in ongoing litigation 
we expect legal costs to vary substantially as the intensity of legal activity changes 
there can be no assurance that we have adequately estimated our exposure for potential damages associated with pending or future litigation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from amortization of deferred stock compensation    upon the acquisition of neomorphic in october  the fair value of unvested common stock subject to restricted stock agreements and the intrinsic value of the unvested options held by employees were deducted from the purchase price and allocated to deferred stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation of million is being amortized to compensation expense over the remaining vesting term  generally two to four years 
the fair value of unvested options held by non employees was also deducted from the purchase price and will be periodically revalued as they vest in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
stock compensation expense has continued to decrease from million in  to million in  to million for the year ended december   and will continue to decrease as a result of the completed amortization of deferred stock compensation related to many of the neomorphic employees 
in addition  during fiscal  million in deferred compensation was removed in connection with the termination of employment of a former neomorphic employee 
the expense for fiscal and is also impacted by the fact that the company ceased amortizing approximately million of deferred stock compensation related to an executive level neomorphic employee who commenced a leave of absence during the latter part of fiscal the remaining million balance will be amortized if and when the employee resumes active status with the company 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles  for fiscal and  the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles represents the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of neomorphic  inc the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  in accordance with sfas  we reclassified million of assembled workforce to goodwill and ceased the amortization of goodwill 
prior to january   the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles includes the amortization of goodwill in addition to the amortization of intangibles 
we completed our review for potential impairment of goodwill as of june   and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill 
in addition  there were no indicators of potential impairment at december  charge for acquired in process technology in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from charge for acquired in process technology   during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of approximately million related to acquired in process technology 
the charge associated with licensing the perlegen snp database was included in acquired in process technology in the consolidated statement of operations as the database has no alternative future use to us 
specifically  the database contains over one million snps and will be used in our research and development program to develop high quality  high content dna analysis microarray products 
the value of the snp database license was determined by estimating the net present value of future cash flows expected from the sale of dna analysis products developed from this database using a present value discount rate of  which is based on our weighted cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the in process research project in which the snp database content will be used 
upon entering into this license agreement in january  our dna analysis development program was approximately complete 
the estimates used by us in valuing the licensed technologies were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
interest income and other  net in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from interest income and other  net     interest income and other  net increased by approximately million  from million in to million in the increase in interest income and other  net was primarily due to the million gain realized on the sale of some of our perlegen stock  along with the acquisition by a publicly traded entity in april of a privately held biotechnology company in which we owned an equity investment 
consistent with emerging issues task force  nonmonetary exchange of cost method investments  we realized a million gain on the acquisition date and recognized an additional gain of million upon the subsequent sale of a portion of these securities 
this was partially offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of a lower average balance in our marketable securities account  lower returns on our cash and marketable securities portfolio and by a million realized loss related to an other than temporary write down of our investment in a venture capital limited partnership 
in  we recorded a million write down related to an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in orchid biosciences  inc and had a million realized loss related to related to an other than temporary write down of our investment in a venture capital limited partnership 
interest income and other  net decreased to million in  down from million in the decrease in interest income and other  net was primarily due to a decrease in interest income because we experienced lower returns on our cash and marketable securities portfolio and also due to the other than temporary write down of our investment discussed in the preceding paragraph 
in addition  we recognized fewer gains on the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes 
in  gains from the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes were reported as extraordinary income 
the gains were reclassified during fiscal from extraordinary income in accordance with financial accounting standard fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections to interest and other income  net 
interest expense in thousands for the years ended december  dollar change from interest expense     interest expense relates primarily to interest paid on our and convertible subordinated notes due in and interest expense decreased to million in from million in because in the second quarter of fiscal we repurchased million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in  and million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in as a result of the repurchases  interest expense decreased by million 
this was partially offset by interest expense and foreign exchange losses relating to certain in licensing payments 
interest expense remained relatively consistent from to we expect to see interest expense decrease in future years with the issuance of the senior convertible notes  and as a result of the redemptions of the convertible subordinated notes in january and the convertible subordinated notes in february the savings will be offset in fiscal however  by the write off of approximately million in issuance costs and the redemption fees related to both the and convertible subordinated notes 
income tax provision the provision for income tax was approximately million in  up from million in in  the provision consists of current taxes accrued on the profits attributable to our foreign operations  federal alternative minimum tax  and state taxes 
in  the provision consists of current taxes accrued on the profits attributable to our foreign operations and state taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes the historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  at december   we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire at various dates in through  if not utilized 
in addition  we have federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code 
we believe the effect of such limitations will not result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
the provision for income tax was approximately million in  up from million in consistent with fiscal  the provision consists of current taxes accrued on the profits attributable to our foreign operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cashflow in thousands for the years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities   net cash provided by used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities    effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents    net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the improvement in net cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the increase in sales experienced during the year ended december   reduced inventory levels as a result of those sales  and an increase in deferred revenue resulting from cash received in january pursuant to the roche transaction 
cash flows from operating activities also increased from million used in operating activities in fiscal to million provided by operating activities in fiscal the improvement in net cash flow from operating activities in was primarily due to an increase in sales  an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liability balances  and a reduction in our inventory balance as we focused on reducing our inventory levels 
this was partially offset by an increase in our accounts receivable 
in and  the net cash used for operations was primarily to fund our operating losses as well as our working capital requirements 
in addition  operating lease commitments increased during by million due to the signing of four lease extensions for some of our facilities in california and the addition of a lease associated with our office in japan 
during  our investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of available for sale securities  primarily consisted of capital expenditures  which totaled million in in addition  million in cash was utilized to fund strategic investments and million was used to purchase an option to license technology and technology rights 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was attributable to million in used on capital expenditures  million which was invested in non marketable equity securities and another million used to purchase technology rights 
in fiscal  million was used for capital expenditures 
in addition  we provided a loan of million to nuvelo 
the loan bears interest at  matures in and is repayable by nuvelo at any time 
the loan balance plus accrued interest was million as of december  at december   nuvelo was in compliance with its financial covenants under the loan agreement 
capital expenditures for through included investments in facilities and production and laboratory equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in during  we repurchased million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in and million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due in additionally  in december we raised million from the sale of senior convertible notes due interest on the senior convertible notes is due june th and december th of each year  beginning on june  and will be paid using cash from operations 
the proceeds from the sale of our senior convertible notes along with our cash generated from operating activities were used to fund the redemption of our notes in january and the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes in february as a result of the redemptions  we expect our cash from operating activities to increase in years subsequent to given that we will now be paying at a lower interest rate on a lower outstanding balance 
we also received proceeds of million during the year from the issuance of our common stock through our stock option plans 
net cash from operating activities decreased to million in from million in in  we repurchased million face value of the convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum for cash consideration of million 
in addition  proceeds of million resulted from the exercise of stock options 
during  we repurchased million face value of the convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum for cash consideration of million  which was offset by proceeds of million resulting from the issuance of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any spe transactions 
the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands total after convertible subordinated notes   senior convertible notes   operating leases      purchase commitments   other commitments     total contractual obligations     amounts represent the face value of our short term notes and does not include any fair value adjustments or bond premiums or discounts 
the convertible subordinated notes will be redeemed in january and the convertible subordinated notes will be redeemed by us in february using the proceeds from the issuance of our senior convertible notes in addition to our cash generated from operations 
our senior convertible notes are due in  however holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on december      and purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on affymetrix and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other commitments relate to an obligation held by the company to contribute money in a venture capital limited partnership 
the venture capital limited partnership may call in this amount  in part or in full at any time according to the contract terms 
other commitments also include a funding obligation related to a research and development agreement which expires in and funding to support two fellowships under the bio x program at stanford 
we have financed our operations primarily through product sales  sales of equity and debt securities  collaborative agreements  interest income  and licensing of our technology 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities of approximately million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations will enable us to maintain currently planned operations and planned capital expenditures estimated to be between million and million for the year ending december   for the foreseeable future 
however  this expectation is based on our current operating  financing and capital expenditure plans  which are subject to change  and therefore we could require additional funding 
we also expect that our capital requirements will increase over the next several years as we expand our worldwide commercial operations  expand our manufacturing capabilities  increase our investments in third parties and expand our research and development efforts 
our long term capital expenditure requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the expansion of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaborative and customer arrangements  the progress of our research and development programs  initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  the purchase of patent licenses  and other factors 
as of december   we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking information and cautionary factors that may affect future results this form k contains forward looking information based on our current expectations 
because our actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of affymetrix  this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our actual future results 
we have a history of operating losses and may incur future losses 
we have experienced significant operating losses since inception 
we incurred net losses of million in and million in although we had net income of million for the year ended december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of such date 
we expect to continue experiencing fluctuations in our operating results and cannot assure sustained profitability 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing and from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations  including the costs of patent related litigation 
our ability to generate significant revenues and maintain profitability is dependent in large part on our ability to expand our customer base  increase sales of our current products to existing customers  manage our expense growth  and enter into additional supply  license and collaborative arrangements as well as on our ability and that of our collaborative partners to successfully manufacture and commercialize products incorporating our technologies in new applications and in new markets 
our quarterly results have historically fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate unpredictably  which could cause our stock price to decrease 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly due in part to factors that are beyond our control and which we cannot predict 
the timing of our customers orders may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
however  we have historically experienced customer ordering patterns for genechip instrumentation and genechip arrays where the majority of the shipments occur in the last month of the quarter 
these ordering patterns may limit management s ability to accurately forecast our future revenues 
because our expenses are largely fixed in the short to medium term  any material shortfall in revenues will materially reduce our profitability and may cause us to experience losses 
in particular  our revenue growth and profitability depend on sales of our genechip products 
factors that could cause sales for these products to fluctuate include our inability to produce products in sufficient quantities and with appropriate quality  the loss of or reduction in orders from key customers  the frequency of experiments conducted by our customers  our customers inventory of genechip products  the receipt of relatively large orders with short lead times  and our customers expectations as to how long it takes us to fill future orders 
some additional factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include weakness in the global economy and changing market conditions  general economic conditions affecting our target industries  changes in the attitude of the pharmaceutical industry towards the use of genetic information and genetic testing as a methodology for drug discovery and development  and changes in the competitive landscape 
many of these factors have impacted  and may in the future impact  the demand for our products and our quarterly operating results 
although we are expanding our customer base  our revenues are generated from a relatively small number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic research centers 
we expect that these customers will in the aggregate continue to account for a substantial portion of revenues for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we continue to experience cautious capital spending by academic and biotech customers and general economic weakness in the biotechnology sector as we did in the first quarter of  revenue expectations from these customer segments may continue to fluctuate 
our business depends on research and development spending levels for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and governmental research institutions 
we expect that our revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived primarily from products and services provided to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic  governmental and other research institutions 
our success will depend upon their demand for and use of our products and services 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by these customers 
for example  reductions in capital expenditures by these customers may result in lower than expected instrumentation sales and similarly  reductions in operating expenditures by these customers could result in lower than expected genechip array sales 
these reductions and delays may result from factors that are not within our control  such as changes in economic conditions  changes in government programs that provide funding to companies and research institutions  changes in the regulatory environment affecting life sciences companies and life sciences research  market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and other factors affecting research and development spending 
we may lose customers if we are unable to manufacture our products and ensure their proper performance and quality 
we produce our genechip products in an innovative and complicated manufacturing process which has the potential for significant variability in manufacturing yields 
we have encountered and may in the future encounter difficulties in manufacturing our products and  due to the complexity of our products and our manufacturing process  we cannot be sure we fully understand all of the factors that affect our manufacturing processes or product performance 
manufacturing and product quality issues may arise as we increase production rates at our manufacturing facility and launch new products 
as a result  we may experience difficulties in meeting customer  collaborator and internal demand  in which case we could lose customers or be required to delay new product introductions  and demand for our products could decline 
although we rely on internal quality control procedures to verify our manufacturing process  due to the complexity of our products and manufacturing process  it is possible that probe arrays that do not meet all of our performance specifications may not be identified before they are shipped 
if our products do not consistently meet our customers performance expectations  demand for our products will decline 
in addition  we do not maintain any backup manufacturing capabilities for the production of our genechip arrays and genechip instruments 
any interruption in our ability to continue operations at our existing manufacturing facilities could delay our ability to develop or sell our products  which could result in lost revenue and seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to deliver acceptable products to our customers due to the rapidly evolving nature of genetic sequence information upon which our products are based 
the genetic sequence information upon which we rely to develop and manufacture our products is contained in a variety of public databases throughout the world 
these genetic sequence databases are rapidly expanding and evolving 
in addition  the accuracy of such databases and resulting genetic research is dependent on various scientific interpretations and it is not expected that global genetic research efforts will result in standardized genetic sequence databases for particular genomes in the near future 
although we have implemented ongoing internal quality control efforts to help ensure the quality and accuracy of our products  the fundamental nature of our products requires us to rely on genetic sequence databases and scientific interpretations which are continuously evolving 
as a result  these variables may cause us to develop and manufacture products that incorporate sequence errors or ambiguities 
the magnitude and importance of these errors depends on multiple and complex factors that would be considered in determining the appropriate actions required to remedy any inaccuracies 
our inability to timely deliver acceptable products as a result of these factors would likely adversely affect our relationship with customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers and we will be unable to manufacture our products if shipments from these suppliers are delayed or interrupted 
we depend on our vendors to provide components of our products in required volumes  at appropriate quality and reliability levels  and in compliance with regulatory requirements 
key parts of the genechip product line  such as the hybridization oven  certain reagent kits and lithographic masks as well as certain raw materials used in the synthesis of probe arrays  are currently available only from a single source or limited sources 
for example  we have relied on enzo life sciences  inc to manufacture various labeling kits recommended for the processing of samples for use with probe arrays in expression analysis applications 
in connection with enzo s lawsuit against us  effective november   enzo terminated its agreement under which affymetrix served as a non exclusive distributor of certain reagent labeling kits supplied by enzo 
see part ii  item  legal proceedings 
although we intend to meet the demands of our customers needs by selling our own genechip brand labeling kits  our inability to do so either as a result of enzo s legal proceedings against us or our inability to obtain a supply of components from other vendors that meet our customers performance and quality demands  could result in lost revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  components of our manufacturing equipment and certain raw materials used in the synthesis of probe arrays are available from one of only a few suppliers 
if supplies from these vendors were delayed or interrupted for any reason  we would not be able to get manufacturing equipment  produce probe arrays  or sell scanners or other components for our genechip products in a timely fashion or in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms 
our success will require that we establish a strong intellectual property position and that we can defend ourselves against intellectual property claims from others 
maintaining a strong patent position is critical to our competitive advantage 
litigation on these matters has been prevalent in our industry and we expect that this will continue 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and the extent of future protection is highly uncertain  so there can be no assurance that the patent rights that we have or may obtain will be valuable 
others have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors 
to determine the priority of inventions  we will have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection 
we cannot assure investors that any such patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications 
also  our intellectual property may be subject to significant administrative and litigation proceedings such as opposition proceedings against our patents in europe  japan and other jurisdictions 
in addition  we have incurred and may in future periods incur substantial costs in litigation to defend against patent suits brought by third parties and when we initiate such suits 
we currently are engaged in litigation regarding intellectual property rights with multilyte ltd and enzo life sciences  inc for additional information concerning intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings  see the section of this form k entitled legal proceedings 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will provide adequate protection for our copyrights  trade secrets or other proprietary information 
in addition  there can be no assurance that trade secrets and other proprietary information will not be disclosed  that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that we can effectively protect our copyrights  trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if we cannot obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights  competitors can design probe array systems similar to our genechip technology 
our success depends in part on us neither infringing patents or other proprietary rights of third parties nor breaching any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our technology  including reagents used in probe array synthesis and in probe array assays  probe array scanners  synthesis techniques  polynucleotide amplification techniques  assays  and probe arrays 
we routinely receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third party patents 
there can be no assurance that we will not infringe on these patents or other patents or proprietary rights or that we would be able to obtain a license to such patents or proprietary rights on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we expect to face increasing competition 
the market for clinical applications products is currently limited and highly competitive  with several large companies already having significant market share 
companies such as abbott laboratories  becton dickinson  bayer ag  celera diagnostics  roche diagnostics  johnson johnson  biom rieux and beckman coulter have the strategic commitment to diagnostics  the financial and other resources to invest in new technologies  substantial intellectual property portfolios  substantial experience in new product development  regulatory expertise  manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers 
established diagnostic companies also have an installed base of instruments in several markets  including clinical and reference laboratories  which are not compatible with the genechip system and could deter acceptance of our products 
in addition  these companies have formed alliances with genomics companies which provide them access to genetic information that may be incorporated into their diagnostic tests 
future competition will likely come from existing competitors as well as other companies seeking to develop new technologies for analyzing genetic information 
for example companies such as applied biosystems and agilent technologies have recently introduced new products for gene expression research and analysis 
in addition  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significant needs for genomic information and may choose to develop or acquire competing technologies to meet these needs 
in the clinical applications field  competition will likely come from established diagnostic companies  companies developing and marketing dna probe tests for genetic and other diseases and other companies conducting research on new technologies to ascertain and analyze genetic information 
further  in the event that we develop new technology and products that compete with existing technology and products of well established companies  there can be no guarantee that the marketplace will readily adopt any such new technology and products that we may introduce in the future 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with collaborative partners  we may have difficulty developing and selling our products and services 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with key companies as well as with key academic researchers 
currently  our significant collaborative partners include qiagen gmbh for the sample preparation and purification systems  invitrogen corporation for reagents and ingenuity systems inc for analytical software 
we collaborate with both beckman coulter inc and caliper life sciences in the development of automation for genechip technology applications for use in drug discovery and development 
roche and biom rieux are collaborative partners in the development of chip products for medical diagnostic and applied testing markets 
relying on these or other collaborative relationships is risky to our future success because our partners may develop technologies or components competitive with our genechip products  our existing collaborations may preclude us from entering into additional future arrangements  our partners may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner  some of our agreements may terminate prematurely due to disagreements between us and our partners  our partners may not devote sufficient resources to the development and sale of our products  our partners may be unable to provide the resources required for us to progress in the collaboration on a timely basis  our collaborations may be unsuccessful  or we may not be able to negotiate future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms 
our success depends on the continuous development of new products 
we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing  and many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
in addition  many current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary genetic content 
the continued success of our genechip products will depend on our ability to produce products with smaller feature sizes  our ability to dice the wafer  and create greater information capacity at our current or lower costs 
if we fail to keep pace with emerging technologies our products will become uncompetitive  our pricing and margins will decline and our business will suffer 
our success in penetrating emerging market opportunities in health management depends on the ability of our genechip technologies to be used in clinical applications for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease 
the clinical applications of genechip technologies for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease is an emerging market opportunity in health management that seeks to improve the effectiveness of health care by collecting information about dna variation and rna expression in patients at various times from prognosis  through diagnosis and on to the end of therapy 
our success depends on our ability to continue to explore and develop market opportunities in health management for clinical applications of our genechip technologies 
these markets  however  are new and emerging and there can be no assurances that they will develop as quickly as we expect or that they will reach their full potential 
in addition  although we believe that there will be clinical applications of our genechip technologies that will be utilized for diagnosing and informing the treatment of disease  there can be no assurance that the application of our genechip technologies in health management will achieve technical or commercial success 
risks associated with technological obsolescence and emergence of standardized systems for genetic analysis 
the rna dna probe array field is undergoing rapid technological changes 
new technologies  techniques or products could emerge which might allow the packaging and analysis of genomic information at a similar or higher density to our microarray technology 
other companies may begin to offer products that are directly competitive with  or are technologically superior to our products 
although we know of no such technology at the present time  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain our technological advantages over emerging technologies in the future 
over time  we will need to respond to technological innovation in a rapidly changing industry 
in addition  although we believe that we are recognized as a market leader in creating systems for genetic analysis in the life sciences  standardization of tools and systems for genetic research is still ongoing and there can be no assurance that our products will emerge as the standard for genetic research 
the emergence of competing technologies and systems as market standards for genetic research may result in our products becoming uncompetitive and could cause our business to suffer 
our current sales  marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products 
to assist our sales and support activities  we have entered into distribution agreements through certain distributors  principally in markets outside of north america  europe and japan 
these and other third parties on whom we rely for sales  marketing and technical support in these geographic areas may decide to develop and sell competitive products or otherwise become our competitors  which could harm our business 
although we have invested significant other resources to expand our direct sales force and our technical and support staff  including the opening of a tokyo office in january to provide direct sales in that region  we may not be able to establish a sufficiently sized global sales  marketing or technical support organization to sell  market or support our products globally 
due to the international nature of our business  political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business 
a significant amount of the company s revenue is currently generated from sales outside the united states 
though such transactions are denominated in both us dollars and foreign currencies  the company s future revenue  gross margin  expenses and financial condition are still affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including export and trade barriers and taxes  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with international operations  such as political  social and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
we cannot assure investors that one or more of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results or require us to modify our current business practices 
we may be exposed to liability due to product defects 
the risk of product liability claims is inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human diagnostic and therapeutic products 
we may seek to acquire additional insurance for clinical liability risks 
we may not be able to obtain such insurance or general product liability insurance on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
a product liability claim or recall could have a serious adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ethical  legal and social concerns surrounding the use of genetic information could reduce demand for our products 
genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information 
for these reasons  governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions  particularly for those that have no known cure 
similarly  such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible 
any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our clinical applications products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our returns on diagnostic products that we may develop with our collaborators 
we are currently developing diagnostic and therapeutic products with our collaborators 
the ability of our collaborators to commercialize such products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of these products will be available under us and foreign regulations governing reimbursement for clinical testing services by government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
in the us  third party payor price resistance  the trend towards managed health care and legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs could reduce prices for health care products and services  adversely affect the profits of our customers and collaborative partners and reduce our future royalties 
we may not successfully obtain regulatory approval of any diagnostic or other product which we or our collaborative partners develop 
the united states food and drug administration must approve certain in vitro diagnostic products before they can be marketed in the us certain in vitro diagnostic products must also be approved by the regulatory agencies of foreign governments before the product can be sold outside the us commercialization of in vitro diagnostic products outside of the research environment that we or our collaborators may develop  may depend upon successful completion of clinical trials 
clinical development is a long  expensive and an uncertain process and we do not know whether we  or any of our collaborative partners  will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of any potential in vitro diagnostic products 
it may take us or our collaborative partners many years to complete any such testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
delays or rejections of potential products may be encountered based on changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review 
moreover  if and when our projects reach clinical trials  we or our collaborative partners may decide to discontinue development of any or all of these projects at any time for commercial  scientific or other reasons 
any of the foregoing matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even where a product is exempted from fda clearance or approval  the fda may impose restrictions as to the types of customers to which we can market and sell our products 
such restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries  ranging from comprehensive device approval requirements to requests for product data or certifications 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or may incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals 
in addition  the export by us of certain of our products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to fda or other export restrictions 
because our business depends on key executives and scientists  our inability to recruit and retain these people could hinder our business expansion plans 
we are highly dependent on our officers and our senior scientists and engineers  including scientific advisors 
our product development and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed if we are unable to attract or retain key talent 
we rely on our scientific advisors and consultants to assist us in formulating our research  development and commercialization strategy 
all of these individuals are engaged by other employers and have commitments to other entities that may limit their availability to us 
some of them also consult for companies that may be our competitors 
a scientific advisor s other obligations may prevent him or her from assisting us in developing our technical and business strategies 
to expand our research  product development and sales efforts we need additional people skilled in areas such as bioinformatics  organic chemistry  information services  regulatory affairs  manufacturing  sales  marketing and technical support 
competition for these people is intense 
we will not be able to expand our business if we are unable to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our strategic equity investments may result in losses 
we periodically make strategic equity investments in various publicly traded and non publicly traded companies with businesses or technologies that may complement our business 
the market values of these strategic equity investments may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control 
other than temporary fluctuations in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies will require us to record losses relative to our ownership interest 
this could result in future charges on our earnings and as a result  it is uncertain whether or not we will realize any long term benefits associated with these strategic investments 
future acquisitions may disrupt our business and distract our management 
we have previously engaged in acquisitions and may do so in the future in order to exploit technology or market opportunities 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner or at all 
furthermore  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve substantial charges and amortization of significant amounts of deferred stock compensation that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the market price of our common stock has been extremely volatile 
the market price of our common stock is extremely volatile 
to demonstrate the volatility of our stock price  during the twelve month period ending on march   the volume of our common stock traded on any given day has ranged from  to  shares 
moreover  during that period  our common stock has traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
furthermore  volatility in the stock price of other companies has often led to securities class action litigation against those companies 
for example  purported securities class action lawsuits were filed against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california after a drop in our stock price following our april  announcement updating our financial guidance for the first quarter of for additional information concerning these purported securities class action lawsuits  see the section of this form k entitled legal proceedings 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our convertible subordinated notes 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted interest rates by year of maturity for our assets and debt obligations and the fair value of each as of december  and periods of maturity fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities    average interest rate loan receivable    average interest rate liabilities convertible subordinated notes due  average interest rate convertible subordinated notes due  average interest rate senior convertible notes due  average interest rate periods of maturity fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities    average interest rate loan receivable    average interest rate liabilities convertible subordinated notes due  average interest rate convertible subordinated notes due  average interest rate we derive a portion of our revenues in foreign currencies  predominantly in europe and japan 
historically  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposures and have not had significant foreign currency differences 
however  in we established a foreign exchange risk management committee fxrmc which has been chartered to review and manage foreign currency exposures 
in early  the fxrmc began hedging activities by using currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposures created from our activities denominated in foreign currencies 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our hedging program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward contracts and the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
at december   total outstanding contracts included the notional equivalent of million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a fair market value of million 
as of december   all contracts were set to expire at various times through december the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk we only contract with reputable institutions 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for our forward contracts  we used a hypothetical change made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities predominately denominated in euros  yen and gbp 
for most of these currencies we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar with all other variables held constant 
the foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss of million at december  and million at december
