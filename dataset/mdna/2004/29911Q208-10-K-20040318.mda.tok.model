all share and per share information presented is stated after giving effect to a for stock split distributed on june   to shareholders of record on may   a percent stock dividend paid on january   to shareholders of record on december   and a percent stock dividend paid on december  to shareholders of record on october  application of critical accounting estimates policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the company s financial statements and notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and valuation of goodwill to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of goodwill reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements is required to be tested by management for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the test for impairment of goodwill on the identified reporting unit is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires judgment and the use of estimates related to the growth assumptions and market multiples used in the valuation model 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by the company during fiscal and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent management believes the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this financial review and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for years ended december  and december  net interest income  the difference between interest income and fee income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on deposits and borrowings  provides the primary basis for the bank s results of operations 
these results are also impacted by non interest income  the provision for loan losses  non interest expense and income taxes 
net income of million in consists of million related to the company s banking activities and million related to the bank s insurance agency activities 
the total net income of million or per share  basic and diluted in compares to million or per share  basic and diluted for all per share data reflect the special percent stock dividend paid on january  and the special percent stock dividend paid on december  net interest income net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields earned on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the following table segregates changes in interest earned and paid for the past two years into amounts attributable to changes in volume and changes in rates by major categories of assets and liabilities 
the change in interest income and expense due to both volume and rate has been allocated in the table to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
compared to compared to increase decrease due to increase decrease due to all amounts in s volume rate total volume rate total interest earned on loans     taxable securities  tax exempt securities federal funds sold time deposits in other banks total interest earning assets     interest paid on now accounts savings deposits time deposits   federal funds purchased other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities    net interest income  before the provision for loan losses  increased million or to million in  as compared to million in  an increase of from over this increase in is attributable to the increase in average interest earning assets of million versus an increase of million in average interest bearing liabilities over this accounts  as indicated in the table above  for a net increase due to volume of approximately million in net interest income 
the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points from in to in  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  from in to in these rate changes resulted in less of a decrease in rate related changes on interest expense versus interest income  or a net decrease in net interest income of approximately million 
the bank s net interest margin decreased from during to during the decrease in net interest margin is due primarily to three factors increased competition from both a loan and deposit pricing perspective  a decrease in the potential to adjust deposit rates significantly lower as a result of the historically low interest rate environment  and a large amount of activity in mortgage refinancing which led to an acceleration of amortization on investment securities purchased at a premium that were backed by mortgages 
the bank believes net interest margin will continue to be challenged in due to two main factors 
banks  generally  are not only competing with each other for available business  but with other providers of loan and investment products  such as credit unions and insurance companies 
a wealth of information is easily obtained by consumers via the internet  from television and through print media 
competitors exist beyond the geographic trade area and banks generally have increased business volumes by offering higher deposit rates and lower loan rates  looking to other potential sources of income  such as fees and service charges  to increase earnings 
in addition  as the bank responds to competitive pricing for assets  the current low interest rate environment will make it difficult to competitively adjust the pricing of liabilities much further down 
the historically low environment provides the bank a smaller interval to move rates on deposits to offset any decrease in asset yield 
the bank regularly monitors its exposure to interest rate risk 
the proper management of interest sensitive funds will help protect the bank s earnings against extreme changes in interest rates 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco meets monthly for the purpose of evaluating the bank s short range and long range liquidity position and the potential impact on capital and earnings as a result of changes in interest rates 
the bank has adopted an asset liability policy that specifies minimum limits for liquidity and capital ratios 
ranges have been set for the negative impact acceptable on net interest income and on the fair value of equity as a result of a shift in interest rates 
the asset liability policy also includes guidelines for investment activities and funds management 
at its monthly meeting  the alco reviews the bank s status and formulates its strategy based on current economic conditions  interest rate forecasts  loan demand  deposit volatility and the bank s earnings objectives 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the amount charged against the bank s earnings to establish a reserve or allowance sufficient to absorb probable loan losses based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio 
factors considered include the collectibility of individual loans  current loan concentrations  charge off history  delinquent loan percentages  input from regulatory agencies and general economic conditions 
on a quarterly basis  management of the bank meets to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in making this determination  the bank analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in its portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff  an independent loan review function and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses is composed of three components specific credit allocation  general portfolio allocation and subjectively by determined allocation 
the specific credit allocation includes a detailed review of the credit in accordance with sfas no 
and no 
 and allocation is made based on this analysis 
the general portfolio allocation consists of an assigned reserve percentage based on the internal credit rating of the loan  using the company s historical loss experience 
the subjective portion of the allowance reflects management s current assessment of the new york state and local economies 
both have lagged behind national prosperity  which has continued to remain unsettled 
marginal job growth  in conjunction with a declining population base  has left the bank s market more susceptible to potential credit problems 
this is particularly true of commercial borrowers 
commercial loans represent a segment of significant past growth as well as concentration in the bank s real estate portfolio 
commercial real estate values may be susceptible to decline in an adverse economy 
management believes that the bank s loan loss reserve is in accordance with regulations promulgated by the occ  and is reflective of its assessment of the local environment as well as a continued growth trend in commercial loans 
in  the company s provision for loan loss was million as compared to million in total non performing loans amounted to  at december   as compared to  at december  the following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses  the total of charge offs  non performing loans and total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding for the three years ended december balance  beginning of year    provisions for loan losses recoveries loans charged off balance  end of year     net charge offs to total loans non performing loans to total loans allowance for loan losses to total loans an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type over the past five years follows balance percent balance percent balance percent at of loans at of loans at of loans in each in each in each attributable category attributable category attributable category to to total to to total to to total loans loans loans real estate loans  commercial loans consumer loans all other loans unallocated  total    balance percent balance percent at of loans at of loans in each in each attributable category attributable category to to total to to total loans loans real estate loans commercial loans consumer loans all other loans unallocated total  both the total increase in allowance for loan losses and allocation of the allowance to commercial loans are in response to the increase in total higher risk commercial loans 
commercial real estate mortgages represent or million of total real estate mortgages at december   as compared to or million at december  commercial real estate contains mortgage loans to developers and owners of commercial real estate 
additionally  commercial loans  which represent loans to a wide variety of businesses  small and moderate across varying industries  comprises of total loans or million at december   as compared to or million at december  the increased allowance and allocation to commercial categories addresses the bank s strategic decision to continue growing this segment  as well as the local economy  which has lagged the national economy 
commercial loans are more susceptible to decreases in credit quality in cyclical downturns and the larger individual balances of commercial loans expose the bank to larger losses 
in addition  growth in the size of the commercial loan portfolio during required additional allowance to provide for probable losses in these loans 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
factors underlying the determination of the allowance for loan losses are continually evaluated by management based on changing market conditions and other known factors 
some factors underlying the allocation of loan losses have changed in as a result of the evaluation of underlying risk factors within each loan category 
the underlying methodology to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
non interest income total non interest income increased approximately million or in over this compares to an increase of approximately million from to bank service charge income in increased approximately million over due to a concentrated effort on increasing fee income in late and early and the rollout of the bank s safeguard overdraft service in early income from the m w agency  inc in accounted for approximately million of the increase in non interest income

salary and benefit expense increased in of the million increase in salary and benefit expense in over  the bank s operations contributed approximately million and m w agency contributed approximately million 
the addition of the lancaster branch  full operating year of the amherst branch  increased loan staffing  m w agency expansion and merit increases contributed to the increased salary costs 
m w agency acquired the business  assets and certain liabilities of the gutekunst agency in the beginning of  and completed a full year of operations of frontier claim services  inc which was acquired on january   which contributed to its increased salary and benefits 
occupancy expense increased approximately million or from to m w agency s addition of the frontier claim services  inc and a full year operation of the amherst branch location increased related occupancy expenses utilities  rent  and depreciation  among others

pension the company maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan  which covers substantially all employees 
additionally  the company has entered into individual retirement agreements with certain current executives providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits 
the company s pension expense for all pension plans  including the serp  approximated  and  for the years ended december   and december   respectively  and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of and compensation rate increases of in both and the increase is primarily due to a change in benefit formula related to the serp  which was changed in to provide a benefit payment based on a percentage of final average earnings as opposed to a fixed benefit under the superceded plan 
also  one additional participant was added to the plan during in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our actuary in conjunction with our historical returns based on the asset allocation of our portfolio 
in evaluating compensation rate increases we evaluated historical salary data as well as expected future increases 
we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return and compensation rate increases at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from at september   for purposes of our defined benefit pension plan and at december   for purposes of our serp  both of which are the measurement dates  to for both plans at september  and december   respectively
