item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of prior years financial statements in preparation for complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of relating to internal control over financial reporting that will be effective for us for our fiscal year ending may   and recent guidance surrounding such legislation  we are restating our financial statements as of may  and for the years ended may  and for the items discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
such restatement primarily relates to adjustments that were identified in the ordinary course of prior audits of our financial statements  but not recorded at the time due to their immateriality 
the effects of the restatements have been reflected in the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview company overview we are a leading regional wireless and broadband wireline and cable television telecommunications service provider serving over one million customers in markets covering over million net pops in the united states and the neighboring caribbean 
in the united states  we are a regional wireless service provider in small cities and rural areas in two geographic clusters covering parts of six states 
in our puerto rico based caribbean service area  which also includes operations in the dominican republic and the us virgin islands  we are a facilities based  fully integrated communications service provider offering both wireless and  in puerto rico and the dominican republic  broadband services to business and residential customers 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered to be forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
please see cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of management s summary our vision is to be the premier regional provider of telecommunications services by tailoring the ultimate customer experience in the markets we serve 
in the united states  we provide digital wireless service in two geographic clusters  covering approximately million net pops 
our midwest cluster includes parts of indiana  michigan and ohio  and our southeast cluster includes parts of louisiana  mississippi and texas 
our clusters are comprised of small cities and rural areas that generally have lower penetration levels than major metropolitan areas 
in the caribbean region  we offer wireless  wireline and cable television services in puerto rico  wireless and wireline services in the dominican republic and wireless services in the us virgin islands 
we derived approximately of our revenue from our caribbean operations for fiscal from our puerto rico operations 
puerto rico is a us dollar denominated and federal communications commission  or fcc  regulated commonwealth of the united states 
the business strategy we use to deliver the ultimate customer experience entails focusing on discreet geographies and customizing our sales  marketing and customer support functions to the unique requirements of these markets 
over of our wireless sales in the united states and caribbean and substantially all of our broadband and cable television sales are made through our own employees  which allows us to have a high degree of control over the customer experience 
we use this control to deliver an experience which our research tells us is unique and valued by the customers in our various markets 
further  by way of the tailored customer experience and rate plans that are similarly customized  we target high quality high usage high arpu postpaid wireless customers 

table of contents our business strategy also entails ensuring that our networks are of the highest quality in all our locations 
in fiscal we spent million on capital expenditures in our us wireless operations 
much of this investment was to upgrade our network to gsm technology in our midwest cluster and to build the foundation for a similar upgrade in our southeast cluster in fiscal we spent million and million on capital expenditures in our caribbean wireless and broadband operations in fiscal this investment included a significant increase to our cell site network in puerto rico  which will ensure enhanced coverage to our customers 
in the dominican republic we completely overhauled our network with the latest generation cdma technology  which we expect will generate similar enhancements to customer service 
we believe that the success of our business is a function of our performance relative to a number of key drivers 
the drivers can be summarized in our ability to attract and retain customers by profitably providing superior service at competitive rates 
we continually monitor our performance against these key drivers by evaluating several metrics 
in addition to adjusted operating income adjusted operating income represents the profitability measure of our segments see note to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliation to the appropriate gaap measure  the following key metrics  among other factors  are monitored by management in assessing the performance of our business gross postpaid and prepaid wireless additions net gain loss wireless subscribers revenue per average wireless customer including roaming revenue  or arpu roaming revenue penetration total wireless postpaid churn wireless prepaid churn caribbean wireless average monthly minutes of use per wireless customer cable television subscribers fiber route miles caribbean broadband switched access lines caribbean broadband dedicated access line equivalents caribbean broadband on net buildings caribbean broadband capital expenditures gross postpaid and prepaid wireless additions represent the number of new subscribers we are able to add during the year 
growing our subscriber base by adding new subscribers is a fundamental element of our long term growth strategy 
we must maintain a competitive offering of products and services to sustain our subscriber growth 
we focus on postpaid customers 
net gain loss wireless subscribers represents the number of subscribers we were able to add to our service during the year after deducting the number of disconnected or terminated subscribers 
by monitoring our growth against our forecast  we believe we are better able to anticipate our future operating performance 
revenue per average wireless customer arpu represents the average monthly subscriber revenue generated by a typical subscriber determined as subscriber revenues divided by average number of subscribers 
we monitor trends in arpu to ensure that our rate plans and promotional offerings are attractive to customers and cost effective 
the majority of our revenues are derived from subscriber revenues 
subscriber revenues include  among other things monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of plan minutes  universal service fund usf support payment revenues  long distance revenues derived from calls placed by our customers  international interconnect revenues  roaming revenue  and other charges such as activation  voice mail  call waiting and call forwarding 

table of contents roaming revenues represent the amount of revenue we receive from other wireless carriers for providing service to their subscribers who roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer is established by an agreement between the roamer s wireless provider and us 
the amount of roaming revenue we generate is often dependent upon usage patterns of our roaming partners subscribers and the rate plan mix and technology mix of our roaming partners 
we closely monitor trends in roaming revenues because usage patterns by our roaming partners subscribers can be difficult to predict 
penetration total wireless represents a percentage  which is calculated by dividing the number of our subscribers by the total population of potential subscribers available in the markets that we serve 
postpaid and prepaid churn represent the number of subscribers that disconnect or are terminated from our service or where there is a lack of usage by prepaid customers for a prescribed period of time 
churn is calculated by dividing the aggregate number of wireless subscribers who cancel service during each month in a period by the total number of wireless subscribers as of the beginning of the month 
churn is stated as the average monthly churn rate for the applicable period 
we monitor and seek to control churn so that we can grow our business without incurring significant sales and marketing cost needed to replace disconnected subscribers 
we must continue to ensure that we offer excellent network quality and customer service so that our churn rates remain low 
average monthly minutes of use per wireless customer represents the average number of minutes mou s used by our customers during a period 
we monitor growth in mou s to ensure that the access and overage charges we are collecting are consistent with that growth 
in addition  growth in subscriber usage may indicate a need to invest in additional network capacity 
cable television subscribers represent the number of customers we have in our puerto rico cable operations 
we monitor trends in the number of cable subscribers to determine the competitiveness of our offering in this market 
fiber route miles are the number of miles of fiber cable that we have laid 
fiber is installed to connect our equipment to our customer premises equipment 
as a facilities based carrier  the number of fiber route miles is an indicator of the strength of our network  our coverage and our potential market 
switched access lines represent the amount of lines connected to our switching center and serving customers for incoming and outgoing calls 
growing our switched access lines is a fundamental element of our strategy 
we monitor the trends in our switched access line growth against forecast to be able to anticipate future operating performance 
in addition  this measurement allows us to compute our current market penetration in the market we serve 
dedicated access line equivalents represents the amount of voice grade equivalent vge lines used to connect two ends points 
we monitor the trends in our dedicated service using vge against forecast to anticipate future operating performance  network capacity requirements and overall growth of our business 
on net buildings is a location where we have established a point of presence to serve one or more customers 
tracking the number of on net buildings allows us to size our addressable market and determine the appropriate level of capital expenditures 
as a facilities based clec  it is a critical performance measurement of our growth and a clear indication of our increased footprint 
capital expenditures represent the amount spent on upgrades  additions and improvements to our telecommunications network and back office infrastructure 
we monitor our capital expenditures as part of our overall financing plan for the company and to ensure that we receive an appropriate rate of return on our capital investments 
this statistic is also used to ensure that capital investments are in line with network usage trends and consistent with our objective of offering a high quality network to our customers 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  which result from our customers not making required payments 
we base our allowance on the likelihood of recoverability of our subscriber accounts receivable based on past experience and by reviewing current collection trends 
a worsening of economic or industry trends beyond our estimates could result in an increase of our allowance for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
property  plant and equipment valuation of long lived assets the wireless communications industry is capital intensive 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment constitutes a substantial operating cost for us 
the cost of our property  plant and equipment  principally wireless communications equipment  is charged to depreciation expense over estimated useful lives 
we depreciate our wireless communications equipment using the straight line method over its estimated useful lives 
we periodically review changes in our technology and industry conditions  asset retirement activity and salvage values to determine adjustments to the estimated remaining useful lives and depreciation rates 
actual economic lives may differ from our estimated useful lives as a result of changes in technology  market conditions and other factors 
such changes could result in a change in our depreciable lives and therefore our depreciation expense in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment  and customer lists are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in our estimation of fair value  we consider current market values of properties similar to our own  competition  prevailing economic conditions  government policy  including taxation  and the historical and current growth patterns of both our business and the industry 
we also consider the recoverability of the cost of our long lived assets based on a comparison of estimated undiscounted operating cash flows for the related businesses with the carrying value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate the fair value of and impairment  if any  of our assets 
these estimates are very subjective in nature  we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
estimates related to recoverability of assets are critical accounting policies as management must make assumptions about future revenue and related expenses over the life of an asset  and the effect of recognizing impairment could be material to our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations 
actual revenue and costs could vary significantly from such estimates 
goodwill and wireless licenses valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review goodwill  wireless licenses and cable franchise costs for impairment based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of january st or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would 
table of contents reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
we have determined that our reporting units for sfas are our operating segments determined under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
in analyzing goodwill for potential impairment  we use projections of future cash flows from each reporting unit to determine whether its estimated value exceeds its carrying value 
these projections of cash flows are based on our views of growth rates  time horizons of cash flow forecasts  assumed terminal value  estimates of our future cost structures and anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
these projections are very subjective in nature 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model eg  growth rates  future economic conditions or discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of the reporting unit are subjective and could result in different values and may affect any related goodwill  wireless licenses or cable franchise costs impairment charge 
for the goodwill impairment test performed as of january  the fair values of our reporting units were in excess of their carrying value 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  results of operations we had approximately  wireless subscribers at may   as compared to approximately  at may   an increase of 
the net loss for the fiscal year ended may  was million  as compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended may  included in the net loss for the fiscal year ended may  were pre tax impairment losses of million for the write down of the cable franchise cost asset in our caribbean operations million and certain undersea cable assets million 
basic and diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended may  was as compared to basic and diluted loss per share of for the fiscal year ended may  we performed our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis during the fiscal year ended may  based on the analysis performed in accordance with sfas  we recorded no impairment charge during fiscal in accordance with sfas  during the fiscal year ended may   we performed an impairment evaluation of our long lived assets in our caribbean broadband businesses because we determined at the time that certain undersea cable assets were to be underutilized 
we performed asset impairment tests at the reporting unit level  the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the tests were performed by comparing the aggregate undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
based on these tests  we determined that certain undersea cable assets should be considered impaired 
the undersea cable assets are a component of property  plant and equipment  net in the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of this evaluation  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million on these assets for the fiscal year ended may   in accordance with sfas there have been no triggering events as defined under the guidance of sfas that would have required us to perform an impairment evaluation of our long lived assets during the fiscal year ended may  during the fiscal years ended may  and  we sold and telecommunications towers  respectively  to aat communications corp  or aat  for approximately million and million  respectively 
under the terms of the agreement  we are leasing back space on such telecommunications towers from aat 
as a result of provisions in the sale leaseback agreement that provide for continuing involvement by us  we have accounted for the sale and lease back of certain towers as a finance obligation in our consolidated balance sheet 
for the sale and lease back of towers determined to have no continuing involvement  sale leaseback accounting has been followed

revenue 
us wireless service revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from new subscribers of million and an increase in service revenue per subscriber of million as compared to the same period last year 
roaming revenue decreased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease was primarily the result of a lower average roaming rate per minute in fiscal than in fiscal this roaming rate variance resulted in a decrease in total roaming revenue of million and was partially offset by higher revenue of million associated with a higher number of roaming minutes of use 
we expect the trend of decreasing roaming revenues to continue 

table of contents our us wireless operations had approximately  and  subscribers as of may  and  respectively 
postpaid subscribers account for of total us wireless subscribers as of may  during the twelve months ended may   increases from new activations of  were offset by subscriber cancellations of  the monthly postpaid churn rate was for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to for the same period last year 
the cancellations experienced by the us wireless operations were primarily due to competitive factors and non payment 
equipment sales increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year due primarily to increased activations and higher end phones being sold in the current year compared to the prior year 
us wireless arpu was for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to for the same period a year ago 
average minutes of use per subscriber were minutes per month for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to minutes for the same period last year 
us wireless arpu increased as a result of new subscribers generally paying more for services than subscribers that were terminated 
costs and expenses 
cost of services increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the fiscal year ended may   primarily due to the variable costs associated with a larger subscription base and associated revenue  higher usage and related infrastructure 
the main components of the increase were telephone service cost  mobile long distance and tower site rent 
these were partially offset by a decrease in incollect cost  which was driven primarily by lower incollect roaming rates 
we have long term roaming agreements with at t wireless and cingular wireless 
as part of these roaming agreements  we significantly reduced the rates we pay when our customers roam on their networks 
cost of equipment sold increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year  due primarily to an increase in phones used for customer retention and to the use of higher priced phones to attract new customers as compared to last year 
general and administrative expenses increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the fiscal year ended may   primarily due to increases in compensation costs associated with the expanding subscriber base  costs related to preparation for the audit of internal control required by the sarbanes oxley act  increased contract labor costs due primarily to use of an outside firm to handle after hours customer care efforts and increased subscriber billing expenses due to increased subscribers 
adjusted operating income for the us wireless operations decreased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period in fiscal primarily due to the reduction in roaming revenue

revenue 
caribbean wireless service revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period of the previous year 
the increase in caribbean wireless service revenue was primarily due to growth in revenue from new subscribers of million for the fiscal year ended may   partially offset by a decrease in service revenue per subscriber of million 
the growth in service revenue was less than the growth in subscribers due to a larger proportionate increase in prepaid subscribers in the dominican republic which have a lower arpu 
our caribbean wireless operations had approximately  subscribers at may   an increase of from approximately  subscribers at may  during the twelve months ended may   increases from new activations of  were offset by subscriber cancellations of  the cancellations experienced by our caribbean wireless operations were primarily the result of competitive factors  non payment and the lack of usage by our prepaid customers 
the monthly postpaid churn rate was for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to for the same period last year 
our postpaid subscribers represented approximately of our total caribbean wireless subscribers at may   down from approximately at may  the decrease in the percentage of postpaid customers is due to growth in our dominican republic operations  which have a higher percentage of prepaid customers 
caribbean wireless arpu was for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to for the fiscal year ended may  the decrease in arpu was primarily due to a change in the subscriber mix as the percentage of total caribbean subscribers from the dominican republic has continued to increase 
the majority of the subscribers in the dominican republic are prepaid subscribers which generally have a lower arpu than postpaid subscribers 
our subscribers used an average of minutes of airtime per month during the fiscal year ended may   compared to minutes per month during fiscal our postpaid subscribers used an average of  minutes of airtime per month during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to minutes of use per month during fiscal costs and expenses 
cost of equipment sold increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase was primarily due to a higher percentage of phones sold 
table of contents instead of leased in puerto rico as compared to the prior year  as well as to an increase in the number of phones used for upgrades and retention 
an increase in the percentage of phones sold increases our costs and expenses because the cost of the phone sold is charged to cost of equipment sold whereas the cost of a phone which is leased by a customer is charged to depreciation expense over the life of the phone 
general and administrative expenses increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period in fiscal primarily due to increases in compensation costs associated with the expanding subscriber base  increases in office rent  costs related to preparation for the audit of internal control required by the sarbanes oxley act and increases in subscriber billing expenses due to increased subscribers

revenue 
caribbean broadband total revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the previous fiscal year 
this change was due to a increase in total access lines and equivalents to  and to an increase in other revenue resulting from an increase in southbound terminating minutes to the dominican republic 
switched revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period a year ago 
this increase was primarily due to a increase in switched access lines to  as of the end of fiscal and a corresponding growth in minutes of use 
this growth in lines and minutes was partially offset by a decrease in revenue per access line of 
this decrease was the result of lower usage per line and slightly lower rates 
dedicated revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase was primarily the result of a growth in voice grade equivalent dedicated lines to  as well as an increase in total revenue per circuit  resulting from an improved mix of sales to higher bandwidth products 

table of contents other revenue increased for the fiscal year ended may  from the same period last year 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in southbound terminating minutes to the dominican republic 
costs and expenses 
cost of services increased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period a year ago  primarily due to an increase in access charges in the dominican republic  resulting from the increase in international long distance minutes we terminate in the dominican republic 
general and administrative expenses decreased during the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the previous fiscal year  primarily due to a reduction of bad debt expense 
bad debt expense has decreased year over year as a result of improved collection efforts and ongoing efforts to collect previously written off accounts 
in addition  billing costs have decreased due to efficiencies achieved in the collections process 
adjusted operating income for the caribbean broadband operations increased for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the same period last year primarily as a result of increases in access lines and equivalents

see liquidity and capital resources for a more detailed discussion of our refinancings 
net interest expense increased for the fiscal year ended may   from the fiscal year ended may  gross interest expense was million for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to million for the same period a year ago 
the increases resulted primarily from interest on our senior notes  and to a lesser extent interest on the senior notes and increased interest on the million mezzanine debt  due to an accreting balance see commitments and contingencies for more information on the mezzanine debt partially offset by reduced interest on the term loans and lower interest due to the expiration of several interest rate swaps 
the weighted average debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended may  was  million  a decrease of million as compared to the weighted average debt level of  million during the fiscal year ended may  as a result of the increase in debt issuance cost expense due to the write off of debt issuance costs in connection with our refinancings  our weighted average interest rate was for the fiscal year ended may  as compared to for the same period a year ago 
exclusive of the write off of debt issuance costs  our weighted average interest rate for the fiscal year ended may  was 
the increase in our weighted average interest rate exclusive of debt issuance costs resulted from the effects of our re financings 
the re financings were undertaken to extend the maturities of our debt  reduce our principal amortization and give us greater flexibility under the financial covenants of our various debt instruments 
the effect of the re financings on us is that our debt is longer term  with less principal amortization  and a higher average interest rate than was the case prior to the re financings 
for a comparison of our outstanding debt before and after the re financings  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pre tax loss before minority interest for the fiscal year ended may  was million  as compared to the pre tax loss before minority interest of million for the fiscal year ended may  income tax expense was million for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the same period last year 
we had a worldwide effective tax rate of negative for the fiscal year ended may   primarily as a result of pre tax book losses generated in the dominican republic for which we cannot record a tax benefit  foreign income tax expense for which we cannot take a credit in the us  state taxes and certain expenses related to our former mezzanine debt that are not deductible for us income tax purposes 
we reported a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended may   which represents a decrease of million from the net loss of million for the same period a year ago

in accordance with sfas  during the fiscal year ended may   we performed an impairment evaluation of our long lived assets in our caribbean broadband businesses because we determined that certain undersea cable assets will be underutilized 
we performed asset impairment tests at the reporting unit level  the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the tests were performed by comparing the aggregate undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
based on these tests  we determined that certain undersea cable assets should be considered impaired 
the undersea cable assets are a component of property  plant and equipment  net in the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of this evaluation  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million on these assets for the fiscal year ending may   in accordance with sfas in august  we sold our interest in cdj  to oceanic digital communications inc  the shareholder of cdj 
this transaction was initiated in fiscal we recorded a pre tax gain of million  which is included in gain loss on disposition of assets in the consolidated statement of operations
