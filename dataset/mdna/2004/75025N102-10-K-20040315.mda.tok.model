item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company including the notes thereto contained in item of this report 
overview we are a leading provider of retail technology focused on the development  installation and delivery of solutions for managing site operations of retail and food service businesses 
our point of sale and back office technology is designed to enable businesses to deliver exceptional client service while improving profitability 
we offer a full range of products that are tailored to specific retail and food service market needs including hardware  software and professional services 
the company offers best of breed solutions designed for ease of integration in managing site operations enabling operators to improve customer service and reduce costs 
we believe our approach to site operations is unique in that our product solutions provide enterprise visibility and control at the site  field  and the headquarters levels 
prior to april   the company operated through five primary reportable segments i petroleum and convenience store ii hospitality and food service iii entertainment iv international and v general retail as the company s product applications have historically been focused on these segments and these markets require many of the same product features and functionality 
during the second quarter  the company restructured its business units and as a result  operated during under two segments  store systems and enterprise software systems 
the store systems segment focuses on delivering site management systems  including point of sale pos  self service kiosk  and back office systems  designed specifically for the company s core vertical markets of petroleum and convenience store  food service and entertainment  while the enterprise software systems segment focused on delivering its web based radiant e enterprise productivity software suite including functionality such as workforce and supply chain management to the broader retail markets both within and outside the company s core vertical markets 
significant trends and developments in the business economic conditions the company has experienced both direct and indirect impacts from declining global economic conditions over the past three years 
the retail industry has remained cautious of investment in information technology during difficult economic times which has resulted in reduced budgets and spending 
this has impacted us through reduced revenues  elongated selling cycles  delay in product implementation  and increased competitive margin pressure 
while these impacts have occurred in recent periods  the longer term impact has been on technology spending habits 
we believe that general economic conditions are showing concrete signs of improvement  however  we also recognize that buying patterns have changed 
demand has shifted from large scale enterprise wide investments to more targeted investments with quicker deployment requirements 
as a result  we expect our revenue base to shift from primarily large dollar purchases by a limited number of customers to a mix of smaller sized purchases by an increased number of customers in a given period 
in addition  pricing has been cut by various competitors creating the potential for long term reductions in product margins 
our expectations for future periods are based on our current view that the major global markets are experiencing an improvement in economic conditions 
given the uncertain nature of the economic environment  these trends could change quickly and have a direct impact on the results of the company 
changes in business performance the company entered anticipating revenue growth over results and increased profits based on planned spending by existing customers and projected closure of deals in the sales pipeline 
beginning in the first quarter ended march  and continuing through the year  the company experienced a decline in revenues and negative operating results 
at the end of the first quarter the company updated market expectations for the change in conditions and the uncertainty in results for the year 
the company attributes this decline to slower than anticipated acceptance and implementations of the radiant e enterprise productivity suite by both new and existing clients as well as the global economic downturn and the resulting delay in purchases by new and existing clients 
in response to these conditions  during the latter part of the first quarter and through the second quarter of  the company  in addition to other measures  downsized its personnel by approximately in order to reduce its operating costs 
during the second quarter  the company established a restructuring reserve of approximately  for purposes of employee severance related to a downsizing of the company s workforce 
the company paid all amounts under this reserve by the end of the second quarter and had no further liabilities related to this action 
restructuring of business segments during the second quarter of  the company restructured its business units into two distinct operating segments  store systems and enterprise software systems 
the store systems segment focuses on delivering site management systems  including point of sale pos  self service kiosk  and back office systems  designed specifically for the company s core vertical markets of petroleum and convenience store  food service and entertainment 
john heyman was appointed ceo of the store systems segment with a strategic direction to re focus the company s efforts on better serving it s core markets and increasing market penetration 
the enterprise software systems segment focused on delivering its web based radiant e enterprise productivity software suite including functionality such as workforce and supply chain management to the broader retail markets both within and outside the company s core vertical markets 
erez goren was appointed ceo of the enterprise software systems segment with a strategic direction of delivering against large contract commitments associated with the enterprise productivity software suite and continuing to market to large retailers across vertical markets 
at the time of the restructuring  management determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the business  the enterprise software systems business  would be sold or otherwise disposed 
the company performed an interim impairment test 
as a result of this impairment test  it was determined that assets were impaired and therefore the company took an impairment charge in the second quarter of details of these non recurring charges are described in the year over year comparison included below under results of operations 
disposition of the enterprise software systems segment on october  the company announced it had entered into a definitive agreement with erez goren  the company s then co chairman and co chief executive officer  in connection with the company s previously announced plan to split off its enterprise software business 
the board of directors authorized and approved the transaction based on the recommendation of a special committee comprised of the company s independent directors 
on january  the split off transaction received the approval of approximately of the disinterested shareholders of radiant at the special meeting of shareholders on that date and the transaction was completed as of january  radiant contributed specified assets and liabilities of the enterprise software business  together with million in cash  to the newly formed subsidiary  and then transferred all of the shares of this new company to erez goren in exchange for the redemption of million shares of common stock of the company held by mr 
goren 
the shares redeemed represented approximately of the company s outstanding shares 
under certain customer agreements radiant has retained the obligation to perform contract obligations that have been sub contracted to the new company 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the separation agreement provides for a shared liability for contract claims of specified contracts over the initial month term of the separation 
management does not believe that liabilities under these agreements are likely but they do represent a potential risk for the company 
the company believes that the disposition of the enterprise software systems segment will materially improve the company s near term profits and cash flow while preserving the opportunity to sell and market the enterprise productivity software suite through a re seller agreement with the new entity 
radiant has agreed to sublease a portion of radiant s property  currently under an operating lease  to bluecube 
this sublease will expire concurrently with radiant s operating lease on the property in january bluecube has the right to early termination beginning on january   and must provide radiant with an month notice that early termination will occur 
aggregate future minimum lease payments under this sublease agreement as of january   are approximately million in  million in  million for years through  and a total of million over the remaining months of the lease 
these amounts are included in radiant s operating lease disclosure at december  see note 
in conjunction with this sublease agreement  radiant and bluecube entered into a right of refusal and option agreement pertaining to real property currently owned by radiant and adjacent to the property being subleased by bluecube 
under this agreement  bluecube has an option to purchase the real property at a stated value  which management believes is the fair value at the time of the split off 
bluecube has the right of refusal if radiant obtains an offer to sell the real property to another party 
the exercising of this right will result in bluecube purchasing the real property at a price based on a formula and the third party offer obtained by radiant 
this agreement is subordinate to a right of first refusal with a third party

critical accounting estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate for purposes of this disclosure only if it meets two criteria 
first  the accounting estimate must require the company to make assumption about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate is made 
second  it must be the case that different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is generated primarily through software and system sales  support and maintenance  and other services 
the company recognizes revenue using the guidance from aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts arb  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
under these guidelines  the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and remaining obligations under the agreement are insignificant 
under multiple element arrangements  where each element is separately stated  sold and priced  the company allocates revenues to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
the company s vsoe of fair value is determined based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements in a multiple element arrangement  the company recognizes revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement is recognized as revenue 
under contracts where revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method under the provisions of sop  the company measures its progress to completion by using input measures  primarily labor hours 
the company continually updates and revises estimates of its input measures 
if those estimates indicate a loss will be incurred  the entire loss is recognized in that period 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific client accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though the company considers these balances adequate and proper  if the financial condition of its clients or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  client inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets and finite lived identifiable intangibles not held for sale whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition  or an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset 
the company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is measured based on quoted market prices  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles as well as capitalized software costs 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
in accordance with sfas no 
the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill as of january st of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company s software development processes and procedures determine the timing of capitalization of certain development costs 
in addition  these software development processes and procedures and estimated future sales determine whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of license fees 
management is required to use its judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
income taxes the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances related to tax accruals and assets could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels
