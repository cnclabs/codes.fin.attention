item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
we are currently conducting clinical programs for four product candidates  which are in various stages of development current phase of product candidate primary indications clinical development vegf trap cancer and eye diseases phase i il trap rheumatoid arthritis phase ii il trap asthma phase i axokine obesity phase iii in addition to our clinical programs  we have research programs focused on angiogenesis  metabolic diseases  muscle atrophy and related disorders  inflammatory conditions  and other diseases and disorders 
we also use our velocigene and trap technology platforms to discover and develop new product candidates 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails significant risk and expense 
since inception we have not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our product candidates and may never receive such revenues 
before revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing research and development and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda and regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
we expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years as we continue the clinical development of vegf trap  il trap  il trap  and axokine  commercialize product candidates that receive regulatory approval  if any  advance new product candidates into clinical development from our existing research programs  and continue our research and development programs 
our activities may expand over time and may require additional resources  and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
table of contents and will depend  among other factors  on the progress of our research and development efforts  the timing of certain expenses  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive from collaborators 
as a company that does not expect to generate product revenues or profits over the next several years  management of cash flow is extremely important 
the most significant use of our cash is for research and development activities  which include drug discovery  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacture of drug supplies for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in  our research and development expenses totaled million 
we expect these expenses to increase in  depending on the progress of our clinical programs 
the principal sources of cash to date have been sales of common equity and convertible debt and funding from our collaborators in the form of up front payments  research progress payments  contract research and development  purchases of our common stock  and loans 
we also receive revenue from contract manufacturing 
a primary driver of our expenses is our number of full time employees 
our annual average headcount in was compared to in and in in  we expect our average headcount to increase to between and  primarily to support our vegf trap and il trap clinical programs 
in  payroll and related costs accounted for of our total operating expenses 
we expect this ratio to decline in  as our clinical expenses grow 
the planning  execution  and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
in our four clinical programs  key events and plans are as follows product candidate events plans vegf trap entered into collaboration agreement with aventis continued phase i trial in cancer complete phase i subcutaneous single agent trial in cancer commence phase i intravenous single agent trial in cancer commence phase ii single agent trials in cancer commence several phase i combination therapy trials in cancer commence multiple phase i trials in eye diseases il trap completed phase iia trial in rheumatoid arthritis commence phase iib trial in rheumatoid arthritis commence phase i trial in other indications evaluate il trap in other inflammatory conditions il trap conducted phase i trial in asthma complete phase i trial in asthma plan for phase ii trial in asthma axokine completed efficacy portion of first pivotal phase iii trial in obesity complete safety extension portion of first phase iii trial complete intermittent treatment trials additional development and market research activities no new phase iii trials planned in september  we entered into a major collaboration agreement with aventis to collaborate on the development and commercialization of the vegf trap 
aventis made a non refundable up front payment of 
table of contents million and purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
under the collaboration agreement  we and aventis will share co promotion rights and profits on sales  if any  of the vegf trap 
aventis has agreed to make a million payment to us upon achievement of an early stage clinical milestone 
we may also receive up to million in additional milestone payments upon receipt of specified marketing approvals for up to eight vegf trap indications in europe or the united states 
regeneron has agreed to continue to manufacture clinical supplies of the vegf trap at our plant in rensselaer  new york 
aventis has agreed to be responsible for providing commercial scale manufacturing capacity for the vegf trap 
under the collaboration agreement  agreed upon development expenses incurred by both companies during the term of the agreement will be funded by aventis 
if the collaboration becomes profitable  we will reimburse aventis for percent of the vegf trap development expenses in accordance with a formula based on the amount of development expenses and our share of the collaboration profits  or at a faster rate at our option 
aventis has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with at least twelve months advance notice 
upon termination of the agreement for any reason  any remaining obligation to reimburse aventis for percent of the vegf trap development expenses will also terminate and we will retain all rights to the vegf trap 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis to jointly develop and commercialize the il trap 
novartis made a non refundable payment of million and purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
on february   we announced that novartis had provided notice of its intention not to proceed with the joint development of the il trap 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  novartis remains obligated to fund agreed upon pre phase iii il trap development expenses during the nine month notice period before its voluntary termination becomes effective 
novartis and we retain rights under the collaboration agreement to elect to collaborate on the development and commercialization of other il antagonists being developed independently by the other party that are in earlier stages of development than the il trap

the majority of cash used in operations was to fund research and development  primarily related to our vegf trap and il trap programs 
in september  the company entered into a collaboration agreement with aventis to jointly develop and commercialize the vegf trap 
aventis made a non refundable up front payment of million which was recorded to deferred revenue and is being recognized as contract research and development revenue ratably over the period over which we are obligated to perform services 
in  we recognized million of revenue related to this up front payment and we anticipate  based on current vegf trap product development plans  that we will recognize approximately million of revenue over each of the next years

as a result  we will recognize million of revenue in  representing the balance of deferred revenue at december  related to novartis non refundable up front payment 
in  we recorded a non cash expense of million associated with the issuance of our common stock in connection with a license agreement entered into with merck 
in both and  we made two semi annual interest payments totaling million per year on our convertible senior subordinated notes 

table of contents cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase is due primarily to purchases of marketable securities which exceeded sales and or maturities of marketable securities by million 
offsetting this increase was a million decrease in cash payments made for capital expenditures due to the completion of the rensselaer plant expansion in cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased to million in compared to million in  due primarily to the sale of stock to aventis and novartis in in association with the collaboration agreements 
aventis purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
novartis purchased  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock for million 
in addition  in accordance with our collaboration agreement with novartis  we elected to fund our share of il trap development expenses through a loan from novartis that will be forgiven  together with accrued interest  should certain preclinical and clinical milestones be reached 
if these milestones are not reached  the loan is due and payable on july  as of december   we have drawn million  excluding interest  against this loan facility and we have drawn an additional million during the first quarter of for expenses incurred during aventis agreement under the collaboration agreement with aventis  we and aventis will share co promotion rights and profits on sales  if any  of the vegf trap 
aventis has agreed to make a million payment to us upon achievement of an early stage clinical milestone

merck license agreement in august  merck granted to us a non exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications which may be used in the development and commercialization of axokine 
as consideration  we issued to merck  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock the merck shares  valued at million based on the fair market value of shares of our common stock on the agreement s effective date 
the agreement requires us to make an additional payment to merck upon receipt of marketing approval for a product covered by the licensed patents 
in addition  we would be required to pay royalties  at staggered rates in the mid single digits  based on the net sales of products covered by the licensed patents 
at any time prior to the date that merck has the right to sell the merck shares under the securities act of the sales date  we have the right to buy back the merck shares from merck for a purchase price equal to the greater of a million and b the lesser of i the fair market value of the shares and ii million 
unless regeneron has previously exercised its right to buy back the merck shares  on the sales date if the fair market value of the merck shares the market price is less than million  we will be required to make a cash payment to merck equal to the difference between the market price and million 
conversely  if on the sales date the market price is greater than million  merck will be required  at its option  to either i make a cash payment to us equal to the difference between the market price and million the excess amount or ii return a number of the merck shares to us  calculated by dividing the excess amount by the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the sales date 
the fair market value of the shares  based on our closing common stock price at december   was million 
convertible debt in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement and received proceeds  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and out of pocket expenses  of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually and mature in the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time before october   if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
upon any such redemption  we are required to pay interest that would have been due up through october  we may also redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after october   if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
as part of this transaction  we pledged million of us government securities which will be sufficient upon receipt of scheduled principal and interest payments to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes when due 
capital expenditures our additions to property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  million in  and million in  including a total over the three years of million related to the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer  new york 
in  we expect to incur approximately million to million in capital expenditures which primarily consists of equipment for our expanded manufacturing  research  and development activities  a portion of which will be reimbursed by aventis 
funding requirements our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we have not historically segregated all the costs associated with each of our 
table of contents research programs and it is not possible to forecast their success or the amounts that we may spend in the future 
we currently have research and development collaboration agreements with aventis  novartis  procter gamble  medarex  emisphere  amgen  and sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
in   and  total expenses for research programs conducted under our third party collaboration agreements were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the remainder of our research and development expenses in those years related to our own internal research programs 
we expect to continue to incur substantial funding requirements primarily for research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing 
we currently anticipate that in approximately of our expenditures will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates  including the vegf trap  il trap  il trap  and axokine  approximately of our expenditures will cover our basic research activities and the continued development of our novel technology platforms  and the remainder of our expenditures will be for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for leases and long term debt 
none of these obligations extend beyond years 
payments due by period less than to to total one year years years in millions convertible senior subordinated notes payable loan payable operating leases other long term liabilities includes amounts representing interest 
excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
includes long term portion of restricted cash awards granted in december which vest semi annually over an approximate two year period 
in january  the company amended its tarrytown lease and exercised its option to extend the lease for certain parts of the leased space through december the amended lease contains renewal options for certain parts of the leased space through december the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of any collaborative research and development collaborations including those with aventis  procter gamble  medarex  and emisphere 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties or otherwise share the profits generated on such sales in connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements 
we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 

table of contents we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at least the end of however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and there may be a change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
in the event we need additional financing for the operation of our business  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects  and the general condition of the financial markets 
we may not be able to secure the necessary funding through new collaborative arrangements or additional public or private offerings 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of our research and development activities or future operations 
this could harm our business 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
during the third quarter of  we elected to change the method we use to recognize revenue under sab related to non refundable collaborator payments  including up front licensing payments  payments for development activities  and research progress milestone payments  to the substantive milestone method  adopted retroactively to january  under this method  we recognize revenue from non refundable up front license payments  not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone  ratably over the period over which we are obligated to perform services 
the period over which we are obligated to perform services is estimated based on product development plans 
these estimates are likely to change based on the results and progress of clinical trials and drug production 
changes in these estimates could result in a significant change to the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
in addition  if a collaborator terminates the agreement in accordance with the terms of the contract  we would recognize the remainder of the up front payment at the time of the termination 
payments for development activities are recognized as revenue as earned  ratably over the period of effort 
substantive at risk milestone payments  which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due  provided there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
previously  we had recognized revenue from non refundable collaborator payments based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete  and total expected contract revenue 
however  the revenue recognized was limited to the amount of non refundable payments received 
the change in accounting method was made because we believe that it better reflects the substance of our collaborative agreements and is more consistent with current practices in the biotechnology industry 
recognition of deferred revenue related to contract manufacturing agreement we have entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with merck under which we manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility and perform services 
we recognize contract manufacturing revenue from this agreement after the product is tested and approved by  and shipped fob shipping point to  merck  and as services are performed 
in connection with the agreement  we agreed to modify portions of our rensselaer facility to manufacture merck s vaccine intermediate and merck agreed to reimburse us for the related capital costs 
these capital cost payments were deferred and are recognized as revenue as product is shipped to merck  based upon our estimate of merck s order quantities each year through the expected end of the agreement 
since we commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in 
table of contents november  our estimates of merck s order quantities each year have not been materially different from merck s actual orders 
clinical trial accrual estimates for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs  which are included in research and development expenses  are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical trial 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment property  plant  and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts  and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
the estimated useful lives of property  plant  and equipment are as follows building and improvements years leasehold improvements life of lease laboratory and computer equipment years furniture and fixtures years in some situations  the life of the asset may be extended or shortened if circumstances arise that would lead us to believe that the estimated life of the asset has changed 
the life of leasehold improvements may change based on the extension of lease contracts with our landlords 
changes in the lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods 
costs of construction of certain long lived assets include capitalized interest which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued sab  revenue recognition  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements

additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab adoption of sab was required immediately and did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  which was issued in january fin r clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of fin r i clarified some requirements of the original fin  which had been issued in january  ii eased some implementation problems  and iii added new scope exceptions 
fin r deferred the 
table of contents effective date of the interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after march   except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered special purpose entities under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december  adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our financial statements

risk factors regeneron operates in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
we caution you to read the following risk factors  which have affected  and or in the future could affect  our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
the risks described below include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
furthermore  additional risks and uncertainties are included under other captions in this report and should be considered by our investors 
risks related to our financial results and need for additional financing we have had a history of operating losses and we may never achieve profitability 
moreover  if we continue to incur operating losses  we may be unable to continue our operations 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
if we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we have no products that are available for sale and do not know when we will have products available for sale  if ever 
in the absence of revenue from the sale of products or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
the extent and timing of our future losses and our profitability  if we are ever to become profitable  are highly uncertain 

table of contents we will need additional funding in the future  which may not be available to us  and which would then force us to delay  reduce  or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts 
we will need to expend substantial resources for research and development  including costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates 
we believe our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through at least the end of however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan and we cannot assure you that there will be no change in projected revenue or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
we will likely require additional financing in the future and we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise such additional funds 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our shareholders 
debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders 
we may be unable to raise sufficient funds to complete the development of our product candidates or to continue operations 
as a result  we may face delay  reduction  or elimination of our research and development programs or preclinical or clinical trials  in which case our business  financial condition  or results of operations may be materially harmed 
we have a significant amount of debt and may have insufficient cash to satisfy our debt service and repayment obligations 
in addition  the amount of our debt could impede our operations and flexibility 
we have a significant amount of convertible debt and semi annual interest payment obligations 
the debt  unless converted to shares of our common stock  will mature in october we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on our debt 
even if we are able to meet our debt service obligations  the amount of debt we already have could hurt our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  or other purposes 
in addition  our debt obligations could require us to use a substantial portion of cash to pay principal and interest on our debt  instead of applying those funds to other purposes  such as research and development  working capital  and capital expenditures 
risks related to development of our product candidates successful development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
we have never developed a drug that has been approved for marketing and sale and we may never succeed in developing an approved drug 
even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  the commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community  and third party payors and on our and our partners ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize our product candidate 
our product candidates are delivered either by intravenous or subcutaneous injections  which are generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery 
if our products are not successfully commercialized  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business would be severely harmed 
clinical trials required for our product candidates are expensive and time consuming  and their outcome is highly uncertain 
if any of our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results  we will have to delay or may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 
we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them 
we need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and human clinical trials 
conducting these trials is a lengthy  time consuming  and expensive process 
these tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many causes  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events or side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in the clinical trial  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  and the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors and other 
table of contents consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol 
a clinical trial may also fail because it did not include a sufficient number of patients to detect the endpoint being measured or reach statistical significance 
for example  the pending trials studying the maintenance of weight loss following short term treatment regimens with axokine may not have enrolled enough patients to detect statistically significant differences between patients treated with axokine and those taking placebo 
these trials were designed before we had access to the data from the completed pivotal phase iii axokine trial  which demonstrated that the magnitude of the average difference in weight loss observed between all axokine treated subjects and those taking placebo was small 
we would need to reevaluate any drug candidate that did not test favorably and either conduct new trials  which would be expensive and time consuming  or abandon the drug development program 
even if we obtain positive results from preclinical or clinical trials  we may not achieve the same success in future trials 
many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry  including us  have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after promising results have been obtained in earlier trials 
the failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for our desired indications could harm the development of the product candidate  and our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
the development of serious or life threatening side effects with any of our product candidates would lead to delay or discontinuation of development  which could severely harm our business 
during the conduct of clinical trials  patients report changes in their health  including illnesses  injuries  and discomforts to their study doctor 
often  it is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these conditions 
various illnesses  injuries  and discomforts have been reported from time to time during clinical trials of our product candidates 
although our current drug candidates appeared to be generally well tolerated in clinical trials  it is possible as we test any of them in larger  longer  and more extensive clinical programs  illnesses  injuries  and discomforts that were observed in earlier trials  as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in smaller previous trials  will be reported by patients 
if additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates has many side effects or causes serious or life threatening side effects  the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed  which would severely harm our business 
our vegf trap is being studied for the potential treatment of certain types of cancer and diseases of the eye 
there are many potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf 
these safety concerns may limit our ability to successfully develop the vegf trap 
genentech and eyetech are developing vegf inhibiting molecules for certain diseases of the eye that will be delivered by direct administration to the eye 
we are studying the vegf trap for the potential treatment of certain diseases of the eye through intravitreal injections in the eye or general administration through intravenous infusions or subcutaneous injections 
although we believe that there are potential clinical advantages to general administration over injections directly in the eye including patient comfort and acceptance  there are unique potential risks to patients associated with systemic blockage of vegf by intravenous infusions or subcutaneous injections that could limit or end the vegf trap development program 
these risks  based on the clinical and pre clinical experience of systemically delivered vegf inhibitors  include bleeding  hypertension  and proteinuria 
in addition  patients given infusions of any protein  including the vegf trap  may develop severe hypersensitivity reactions  referred to as infusion reactions 
there may be additional complications or side effects that could harm the development of the vegf trap for either the treatment of cancer or diseases of the eye 
our product candidates in development are recombinant proteins that could cause an immune response  resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
in addition to the safety  efficacy  manufacturing  and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates  the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response  resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein  or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect 
in some cases  
table of contents the antibody can cross react with the patient s own proteins  resulting in an auto immune type disease 
whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments  and their appearance is often delayed  so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be created at a later date in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been completed 
approximately two thirds of the subjects who received axokine in the completed phase iii study developed neutralizing antibodies 
in addition  subjects who received the il trap in clinical trials have developed antibodies 
it is possible that as we test the vegf trap in different patient populations and larger clinical trials  subjects given the vegf trap will develop antibodies to the product candidate 
a previous phase iii study evaluating axokine demonstrated modest average weight loss over a month period 
in addition  a completed phase ii study evaluating the il trap in patients with rheumatoid arthritis failed to achieve its primary endpoint 
in march  we reported data from the month treatment period of our initial phase iii pivotal trial of axokine 
although the phase iii study met its primary endpoints and many individuals achieved a medically meaningful weight loss  the average weight loss was small and limited by the development of antibodies 
in october  we reported results from the first phase ii trial of our il trap 
while patients treated with the highest dose  milligrams of the il trap  exhibited improvements in the primary endpoint of the trial  the proportion of acr responses versus placebo  the results did not achieve statistical significance 
we plan to conduct a phase iib study of the il trap in a larger patient population  testing higher doses than were tested in the previous phase ii trial and for a longer period of time 
however  there is no assurance that higher doses will lead to better results than were demonstrated in the previous phase ii trial 
in addition  safety or tolerability concerns may arise which limit our ability to deliver higher doses of the il trap to patients 
we plan to study higher doses of the il trap through increased subcutaneous injections and intravenous delivery 
either approach may affect the safety and or tolerability of the il trap  which may limit its commercial potential if the product candidate is ever approved for marketing and sale 
regulatory and litigation risks if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will not be able to market or sell them 
we cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval 
if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates  the value of our company and our results of operations will be harmed 
in the united states  we must obtain and maintain approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for each drug we intend to sell 
obtaining fda approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
foreign governments also regulate drugs distributed in their country and approval in any country is likely to be a lengthy and expensive process  and approval is highly uncertain 
none of our product candidates has ever received regulatory approval to be marketed and sold in the united states or any other country 
we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
if the testing or use of our products harms people  we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
we could also face costly and damaging claims arising from employment law  securities law  environmental law  or other applicable laws governing our operations 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of drugs for use in people expose us to product liability risk 
we are currently involved in a product liability lawsuit brought by a subject who participated in a clinical trial of one of our drug candidates 
any informed consent or waivers obtained from people who sign up for our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of litigation 
our product liability insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation 
moreover  we may not have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms 

table of contents in may  securities class action lawsuits were commenced against regeneron and certain of its officers and directors in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed in october the complaint  which purports to be brought on behalf of a class consisting of investors in the company s publicly traded securities between march  and march   alleges that the defendants misstated or omitted material information concerning the safety and efficacy of axokine  in violation of sections b and a of the securities and exchange act of  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
damages are sought in an unspecified amount 
no reserve for damages has been established because we do not believe that a loss is probable 
however  if the outcome of the litigation is adverse to us  we could be subject to significant liability  which could exceed our insurance coverage 
our operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations 
we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials 
as a biopharmaceutical company with significant manufacturing operations  we are subject to extensive environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the use of hazardous materials 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals  viruses  radioactive compounds  and other hazardous materials 
the cost of compliance with environmental  health  and safety regulations is substantial 
if an accident involving these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  or face regulatory actions  which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage 
risks related to our dependence on third parties on february   novartis provided notice to us that they would not participate in the continued development and commercialization of the il trap under our collaboration agreement 
this may harm our ability to develop and commercialize the il trap 
we relied heavily on novartis to provide their expertise  resources  funding  manufacturing capacity  clinical expertise  and commercial infrastructure to support the il trap program 
novartis decision to withdraw from participating in the development and commercialization of the il trap may delay or disrupt the il trap program 
we do not have the resources and skills to replace those of novartis to help the development and potential commercialization of the il trap 
in addition  we will have to fund the development and commercialization of the il trap without novartis long term commitment  which will require substantially greater expenditures on our part 
while the agreement requires novartis to continue to fund agreed pre phase iii development expenses for the nine month period following its termination decision and imposes additional post termination obligations on the parties  novartis may not fulfill all payment and other obligations we believe are required of it under the agreement  which may cause us to incur further costs and risk delays and disruptions to the il trap program 
if our collaboration with aventis for the vegf trap is terminated  our ability to develop and commercialize the vegf trap in the time expected  or at all  and our business operations would be harmed 
we rely heavily on aventis to assist with the development of the vegf trap 
if the vegf trap program continues  we will rely on aventis to assist with providing commercial manufacturing capacity  enrolling and monitoring clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval  particularly outside the united states  and providing sales and marketing support 
while we cannot assure you that the vegf trap will ever be successfully developed and commercialized  if aventis does not perform its obligations in a timely manner  or at all  our ability to develop  manufacture  and commercialize the vegf trap will be significantly adversely affected 
aventis has the right to terminate rights to our product candidates under its collaboration agreement with us at 
table of contents any time 
if aventis were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us  we might not have the resources or skills to replace those of our partner  which could cause significant delays in the development and or manufacture of the vegf trap and result in substantial additional costs to us 
we have no sales  marketing  or distribution capabilities 
termination of the aventis collaboration agreement would create new and additional risks to the successful development of the vegf trap 
sanofi synthelabo has initiated a tender offer in an attempt to acquire aventis 
it is unclear what the impact of this or any other business combination involving aventis would have on the vegf trap collaboration  including the possibility of a termination of the collaboration agreement and a delay in  or disruption to  the vegf trap development program 
our collaborators and service providers may fail to perform adequately in their efforts to support the development  manufacture  and commercialization of our drug candidates 
we depend upon third party collaborators  including aventis and service providers such as clinical research organizations  outside testing laboratories  clinical investigator sites  and third party manufacturers and product packagers and labelers  to assist us in the development of our product candidates 
if any of our existing collaborators or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a timely manner or at all  we would experience additional costs  delays  and difficulties in the development or ultimate commercialization of our product candidates 
risks related to the manufacture of our product candidates we have limited manufacturing capacity  which could inhibit our ability to successfully develop or commercialize our drugs 
before approving a new drug or biologic product  the fda requires that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp requirements 
manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex  time consuming  and expensive 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured for development and  following approval  in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and at competitive costs 
if we or any of our product collaborators or third party manufacturers  fillers  or labelers are unable to maintain regulatory compliance  the fda can impose regulatory sanctions  including  among other things  refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug or biologic product  or revocation of a pre existing approval 
as a result  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
while we believe our current manufacturing facility is adequate for the current production of quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients  or api  for our product candidates for clinical trials  our manufacturing facility is likely to be inadequate to produce sufficient quantities of product for commercial sale 
we intend to rely on our corporate collaborators  as well as contract manufacturers  to produce large quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products 
we rely entirely on third party manufacturers for filling and finishing services 
we will have to depend on these manufacturers to deliver material on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements 
if we are unable to supply sufficient material on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our corporate collaborators or contract manufacturers  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
we may expand our own manufacturing capacity to support commercial production of api for our product candidates 
this will require substantial additional funds  and we would need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our facility 
start up costs can be large and scale up entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields 
we may be unable to develop manufacturing facilities that are sufficient to produce drug material for clinical trials or commercial use 
in addition  we may be unable to secure adequate filling and finishing services to support our products 
as a result  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially harmed 
we may be unable to obtain key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of our product candidates 
in addition  we may face difficulties in developing or acquiring production technology and managerial personnel to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in 
table of contents compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements 
if any of our clinical programs are discontinued  we may face costs related to the underutilization of our manufacturing facilities 
we maintain an  square foot manufacturing facility in tarrytown  new york and have large scale manufacturing operations in rensselaer  new york 
under a long term manufacturing agreement with merck  we produce an intermediate for a merck pediatric vaccine at our facility in rensselaer  new york 
we also use our facilities to produce api for our own clinical and preclinical candidates 
if we no longer use our facilities to manufacture the merck intermediate or clinical candidates are discontinued  we would have to absorb overhead costs and inefficiencies 
risks related to commercialization of products if we are unable to establish sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities  or enter into agreements with third parties to do so  we will be unable to successfully market and sell future drug products 
we have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities and have only a small staff with marketing capabilities 
if we are unable to obtain those capabilities  either by developing our own organizations or entering into agreements with service providers  we will not be able to successfully sell our products 
in that event  we will not be able to generate significant revenue  even if our product candidates are approved 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need 
we may not be able to enter into marketing  or distribution agreements with third party providers on acceptable terms  if at all 
currently  we are relying on aventis for sales  marketing  and distribution of the vegf trap 
we will have to rely on a third party or devote significant resources to develop our own sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities for our other product candidates 
we may be unsuccessful in developing our own sales  marketing  and distribution organization 
we may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use 
changes in product formulations and manufacturing processes may be required as product candidates progress in clinical development and are ultimately commercialized 
if we are unable to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing processes to support large scale clinical testing of our product candidates  including vegf trap  il trap  il trap and axokine  we may be unable to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials  which would delay the development of our product candidates 
similarly  if we are unable to supply sufficient quantities of product or develop product formulations suitable for commercial use  we will not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
for example  axokine is currently formulated for delivery in single use vials 
we are in the process of developing a formulation that may be used in multiple use vials 
if we are unable to develop this multiple use vial formulation  potential future axokine sales and profitability may be limited 
another example is our il trap 
we are in the process of developing formulations that would allow delivery of higher doses of the il trap to test in clinical trials 
this includes formulations for subcutaneous and intravenous administration 
if we are unable to develop or manufacture such a higher dose formulation that can be produced in a cost effective manner  potential future il trap sales and profitability may be limited 
even if our product candidates are ever approved  their commercial success is highly uncertain because our competitors may get to the marketplace before we do with better or lower cost drugs 
there is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and chemical companies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research  preclinical  and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities  and financial  marketing  and human resources than we do 
our smaller competitors may also be significant if they acquire or discover patentable inventions  form collaborative arrangements  or merge with large pharmaceutical companies 
even 
table of contents if we achieve product commercialization  our competitors have achieved  and may continue to achieve  product commercialization before our products are approved for marketing and sale 
genentech has an approved vegf antagonist on the market and many different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working to develop competing vegf antagonists  including novartis and pfizer 
many of these molecules are farther along in development than the vegf trap and may offer competitive advantages over our molecule 
the marketing approval for genentech s vegf antagonist  avastin  may make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in clinical trials to support the vegf trap 
the markets for both rheumatoid arthritis and asthma are both very competitive 
several highly successful medicines are available for these diseases 
examples include the tnf antagonists enbrel a registered trademark of amgen  remicade a registered trademark of centocor  and humira a registered trademark of abbott for rheumatoid arthritis  and the leukotriene modifier singulair a registered trademark of merck  as well as various inexpensive corticosteroid medicines for asthma 
the availability of highly effective fda approved tnf antagonists makes it more difficult to successfully develop the il trap for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
it will be difficult to enroll patients with rheumatoid arthritis to participate in clinical trials of the il trap  which may delay or impair our ability to successfully develop the drug candidate 
in addition  even if the il trap is ever approved for sale  it will be difficult for our drug to compete against these fda approved tnf antagonists because doctors and patients will have significant experience using these effective medicines 
there is also substantial competition in the discovery and development of treatments for obesity  as well as established  cost effective  and emerging surgical  prescription  and over the counter treatments for the disease that may offer competitive advantages over axokine 
axokine is available only in injectible form  while the currently available marketed medicines for the treatment of obesity  and a late stage product candidate in development by sanofi synthelabo  are delivered in pill form  which is generally favored over injectible medicines 
therefore  even if axokine is approved for sale  the fact that it must be delivered by injection may severely limit its market acceptance among patients and physicians 
the successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third party payors 
sales of biopharmaceutical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers 
without the financial support of the governments or third party payors  the market for any biopharmaceutical product will be limited 
these third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of any new therapeutic  particularly if there exist lower cost standards of care 
third party payors may not reimburse sales of our products  which would harm our business 
risks related to employees we are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research  development  manufacturing  and commercial organizations  our business will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
if we are not able to retain any of these persons or our chairman  our business may suffer 
in particular  we depend on the services of roy vagelos  md  the chairman of our board of directors  leonard schleifer  md  md  our president and chief executive officer  and george d 
yancopoulos  md  md  our executive vice president  chief scientific officer and president  regeneron research laboratories 
there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of drugs 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 

table of contents risks related to intellectual property if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or our patents are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights  our business and competitive position will be harmed 
our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and other information that we protect as trade secrets 
we seek to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements 
if our trade secrets are improperly exposed  either by our own employees or our collaborators  it would help our competitors and adversely affect our business 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of biotechnology companies involves complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
our patents may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
one way a patent application may be challenged outside the united states is for a party to file an opposition 
these opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the european union and are costly to defend 
we have patent applications that are being opposed and it is likely that we will defend additional patent applications in the future as third parties oppose them 
also  our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against competitors 
the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
we may be restricted in our development and or commercialization activities by third party patents 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
other parties could allege to have blocking patents to our trap products in clinical development  either because of a proprietary position on fusion proteins or a proprietary position covering components of the trap or the way it is manufactured 
we are aware of certain united states and foreign patents relating to particular il and il receptors 
our il trap includes portions of the il and il receptors 
in addition  we are aware of a broad patent held by genentech relating to proteins fused to certain immunoglobulin domains 
our trap product candidates include proteins fused to immunoglobulin domains 
with regard to these patents  we have determined that in our judgment that either our products do not infringe the patents  we do not believe the patents are valid  or we have identified and are testing or developing various modifications that we believe should not infringe the patents 
any patent holders could sue us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing  selling  or developing our drug candidates  and a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties 
in the event that the manufacture  use  or sale of any of our clinical candidates infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of third parties  we may be prevented from pursuing product development  manufacturing  and commercialization of our drugs and may be required to pay costly damages 
such a result may materially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
legal disputes are likely to be costly and time consuming to defend 
we seek to obtain licenses to patents when  in our judgment  such licenses are needed 
if any licenses are required  we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of our product candidates  which could severely harm our business 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may be extremely volatile 
there has been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies securities 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
these factors include  by way of example progress  delays  or adverse results in clinical trials  announcement of technological innovations or product candidates by us or competitors  
table of contents fluctuations in our operating results  public concern as to the safety or effectiveness of our product candidates  developments in our relationship with collaborative partners  developments in the biotechnology industry or in government regulation of healthcare  large sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors  or significant shareholders  arrivals and departures of key personnel  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors  including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock in the market 
broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price 
a number of our shareholders own a substantial amount of our common stock 
if our significant shareholders or we sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
sales by our significant shareholders  including amgen  aventis  and novartis  also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deemed appropriate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate and us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimated that a one percent change in interest rates would result in an approximately million and million change in the fair market value of our investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the increase is due primarily to a higher investment portfolio balance and slightly longer duration as of december  in comparison to
