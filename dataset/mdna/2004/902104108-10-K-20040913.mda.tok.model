item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are also identified by words such as expects  anticipates  believes  intends  plans  projects  or similar expressions 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risk factors described in the risk factors set forth in this item critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the company s management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty reserves  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets including acquired intangibles and goodwill  accrual of bonus and profit sharing estimates  accrual of income tax liability estimates and accounting for stock based compensation 
management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is established or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue for all business segments  other than for contract research and development  is recognized from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is at the time of shipment 
the company performs research and development under contract agreements with customers based on cost plus fixed fee  cost reimbursable or fixed fee terms 
these contracts generally require the company to produce and provide developmental materials and or products to those customers 
revenues from cost plus fixed fee and cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
we follow the guidelines of statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts for our fixed fee contracts 
revenue and profits on each fixed fee contract are accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting  whereby revenue and profits are recognized throughout the performance period of the contract 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
the estimated total cost for each contract is periodically reevaluated and revised  when necessary  throughout the life of the contract 
losses on contracts are recorded in full when identified 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts and a warranty reserve based on historical experience and believe the collection of revenues  net of these reserves  is reasonably assured 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate for potential non collection of accounts receivable based on historical experience 
the company has not experienced a non collection of accounts receivable materially affecting its financial position or results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended june   and if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate causing an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for bad debts may be required in future periods 
the company records a warranty reserve as a charge against earnings based on a percentage of revenues utilizing actual returns over the last twelve months 
if actual returns are not consistent with the historical data used to calculate these estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
the company records a slow moving inventory reserve as a charge against earnings for all products on hand that have not been sold to customers in the past twelve months or cannot be further manufactured for sale to alternative customers 
an additional reserve is recorded for product on hand that is in excess of product sold to customers over the past twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the company tests goodwill on at least an annual basis for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the determination of related estimated useful lives of other intangible assets and whether goodwill is impaired involves judgments based upon long term projections of future performance 
a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the fair value of the reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
based on the results of the most recently completed analysis  the company s goodwill was not impaired as of june  no event has occurred as of or for the period ended june  that would give management an indication that an impairment charge was necessary that would adversely affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company records bonus and profit sharing estimates as a charge against earnings based on a formula percentage of the company s operating income 
these estimates are adjusted to actual based on final results of operations achieved during the fiscal year 
partial bonus amounts are paid quarterly based on interim company performance  and the remainder is paid after fiscal year end and final determination of the applicable percentage 
other bonuses and profit sharing are paid annually 
the company records an estimated income tax liability to recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
judgment is required in estimating the future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or the income tax returns 
the company uses the intrinsic value approach specified in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  for stock options granted to officers and key employees  and therefore does not record compensation costs based upon the fair value of options at the date of grant 
see notes a and k to the company s consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  estimated accruals are recorded as a charge against earnings based on known circumstances where it is probable that a liability has been incurred or is expected to be incurred and the amount can reasonably be estimated

we are a leading producer of znse for our internal use and for external sale 
the production of znse is a complex process requiring production in a highly controlled environment 
a number of factors  including defective or contaminated materials  could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality znse 
znse is available from only one outside source where quantity and qualities may be limited 
the unavailability of necessary amounts of high quality znse would have a material adverse effect upon us 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we produce hydrogen selenide gas which is used in our production of znse 
there are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material 
our inability to effectively handle hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of hydrogen selenide 
hydrogen selenide can be obtained from one outside source 
the cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production 
as a result  purchasing a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would increase our production costs of znse 
therefore  our inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  we utilize other high purity  relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products 
failure of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
international sales account for a significant portion of our revenues sales to customers in countries other than the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the years ended june   and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we manufacture products in singapore and china and maintain direct sales offices in germany  japan  switzerland  the uk and belgium 
sales and operations outside of the united states are subject to certain inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  restrictions on the export or import of technology  potentially limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in particular  although our international sales  other than in germany  japan  belgium and the uk  are denominated in us dollars  currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  by rendering us less price competitive than foreign manufacturers 
our sales in japan are denominated in yen and  accordingly  are affected by fluctuations in the dollar yen currency exchange rates 
we generally reduce our exposure to such fluctuations through forward exchange agreements hedging approximately of our sales in japan 
we do not engage in the speculative trading of financial derivatives 
there can be no assurance  however  that our practices will reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuation in the dollar yen currency exchange rate 
we may encounter substantial competition we may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market  including established companies with substantial resources 
some of our competitors may have financial  technical  marketing or other capabilities more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors  and competition may adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
there are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property we rely on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and employee non competition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that  in the future  third parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
asserting our rights or defending against third party claims could involve substantial expense  thus materially and adversely affecting our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in the event a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights  we may have to pay substantial damages or royalties  or expend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify the process so that it no longer infringes such proprietary rights  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our success depends on the ability to retain key personnel we are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists  engineers  production and management personnel 
competition for the services of these personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success 
the loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
failure to keep pace with industry developments may adversely affect our operations we are engaged in industries which will be affected by future developments 
the introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable 
our continued success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost effective basis new products  processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  applications and processes and product or process enhancements  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products  applications or processes  or that our products  applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products  applications or processes or product or process enhancements or if we did not gain market acceptance 
our success depends on new products and processes in order to meet our strategic objectives  we must continue to develop  manufacture and market new products  develop new processes and improve existing processes 
as a result  we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to continue to consider from time to time the strategic acquisition of businesses  products  or technologies complementary to our business 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors including product selection  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  effective sales and marketing  and product performance in the field 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
we may expand product lines and markets by acquiring other businesses our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through internal product development and acquisitions 
any acquisition may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  acquired businesses may be experiencing operating losses 
any acquisition will involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  and the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees
