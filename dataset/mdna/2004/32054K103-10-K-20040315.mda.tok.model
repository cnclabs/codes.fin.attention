in may  the company  through wholly owned limited liability companies of which the operating partnership is the sole member  entered into a joint venture arrangement the may joint venture with an institutional investor to invest in industrial properties 
as of december   the may joint venture did not own any industrial properties 
management believes the company s financial condition and results of operations are  primarily  a function of the company s performance in four key areas leasing of industrial properties  acquisition and development of additional industrial properties  redeployment of internal capital and access to external capital 
the company generates revenue primarily from rental income and tenant recoveries from the lease of industrial properties under long term generally three to six years operating leases 
such revenue is offset by certain property specific operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  property management  utilities and insurance expenses  along with certain other costs and expenses  such as depreciation and amortization costs and general and administrative and interest expenses 
the company s revenue growth is dependent  in part  on its ability to i increase rental income  through increasing either or both occupancy rates and rental rates at the company s properties  ii maximize tenant recoveries and iii minimize operating and certain other expenses 
revenues generated from rental income and tenant recoveries are a significant source of funds  in addition to income generated from gains losses on the sale of the company s properties as discussed below  for the company s distributions 
the leasing of property  in general  and occupancy rates  rental rates  operating expenses and certain non operating expenses  in particular  are impacted  variously  by property specific  market specific  general economic and other conditions  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the leasing of property also entails various risks  including the risk of tenant default 
if the company were unable to maintain or increase occupancy rates and rental rates at the company s properties or to maintain tenant recoveries and operating and certain other expenses consistent with historical levels and proportions  the company s revenue growth would be limited 
further  if a significant number of the company s tenants were unable to pay rent including tenant recoveries or if the company were unable to rent its properties on favorable terms  the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  the company s common stock would be adversely affected 
the company s revenue growth is also dependent  in part  on its ability to acquire existing  and acquire and develop new  additional industrial properties on favorable terms 
the company continually seeks to acquire existing industrial properties on favorable terms  and  when conditions permit  also seeks to acquire and develop new industrial properties on favorable terms 
existing properties  as they are acquired  and acquired and developed properties  as they lease up  generate revenue from rental income and tenant recoveries  income from which  as discussed above  is a source of funds for the company s distributions 
the acquisition and development of properties is impacted  variously  by property specific  market specific  general economic and other conditions  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the acquisition and development of properties also entails various risks  including the risk that the company s investments may not perform as expected 
for example  acquired existing and acquired and developed new properties may not sustain and or achieve anticipated occupancy and rental rate levels 
with respect to acquired and developed new properties  the company may not be able to complete construction on schedule or within budget  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties 
also  the company faces significant competition for attractive acquisition and development opportunities from other well capitalized real estate investors  including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private investors 
further  as discussed below  the company may not be able to finance the acquisition and development opportunities it identifies 
if the company were unable to acquire and develop sufficient additional properties on favorable terms or if such investments did not perform as expected  the company s revenue growth would be limited and its financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  the company s common stock would be adversely affected 
the company also generates income from the sale of properties including existing buildings  buildings which the company has developed or re developed on a merchant basis and land 
the company is continually engaged in  and its income growth is dependent  in part  on systematically redeploying its capital from properties and other assets with lower yield potential into properties and other assets with higher yield potential 
as part of that process  the company sells  on an ongoing basis  select stabilized properties or properties offering lower potential returns relative to their market value 
the gain loss on the sale of such properties is included in the company s income and is a significant source of funds  in addition to revenues generated from rental income and tenant recoveries for the company s distributions 
also  a significant portion of the proceeds from such sales is used to fund the acquisition of existing  and the acquisition and development of new  industrial properties 
the sale of properties is impacted  variously  by property specific  market specific  general economic and other conditions  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the sale of properties also entails various risks  including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of the company s properties 
further  the company s ability to sell properties is limited by safe harbor rules applying to reits under the code which relate to the number of properties that may be disposed of in a year  their tax bases and the cost of improvements made to the properties  along with other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
if the company were unable to sell properties on favorable terms  the company s income growth would be limited and its financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  the company s common stock would be adversely affected 
currently  the company utilizes a portion of the net sales proceeds from property sales  as well as borrowings under its million unsecured line of credit the unsecured line of credit  to finance future acquisitions and developments 
nonetheless  access to external capital on favorable terms plays a key role in the company s financial condition and results of operations  as it impacts the company s cost of capital and its ability  and cost  to refinance existing indebtedness as it matures and to fund future acquisitions and developments  if the company chooses to do so  through the issuance of additional equity securities 
the company s ability to access external capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on the company s capital stock and debt  the market s perception of the company s growth potential  the company s current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of the company s capital stock 
if the company were unable to access external capital on favorable terms  the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  the company s common stock would be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts which is based on estimates of potential losses which could result from the inability of the company s tenants to satisfy outstanding billings with the company 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate based on the company s assessment of the creditworthiness of its tenants 
properties are classified as held for sale when the company has entered into a binding contract to sell such properties 
when properties are classified as held for sale  the company ceases depreciating the properties and estimates the values of such properties and measures them at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  less costs to dispose 
if circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely  and  as a result  the company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale  the company will reclassify such property as held and used 
the company estimates the value of such property and measures it at the lower of its carrying amount adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
the company reviews its properties on a quarterly basis for possible impairment and provides a provision if impairments are determined 
the company utilizes the guidelines established under financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas to determine if impairment conditions exist 
the company reviews the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property to determine if there are any indications of impairment 
the review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value  accordingly  the anticipated cash flows may not ultimately be achieved 
the company is engaged in the acquisition of individual properties as well as multi property portfolios 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  the company is required to allocate purchase price between land  building  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  intangible assets and above and below market leases 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rents for each corresponding in place lease 
acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the company also must allocate purchase price on multi property portfolios to individual properties 
the allocation of purchase price is based on the company s assessment of various characteristics of the markets where the property is located and the expected cash flows of the property

the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed on the previous contractual obligations and commitments table 
environmental the company incurred environmental costs of approximately 
million and approximately 
million in and  respectively 
the company estimates costs of approximately 
million 
the company estimates that the aggregate cost which needs to be expended in and beyond with regard to currently identified environmental issues will not exceed approximately million  a substantial amount of which will be the primary responsibility of the tenant  the seller to the company or another responsible party 
this estimate was determined by a third party evaluation 
inflation for the last several years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rates in the company s markets of operation 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the outstanding leases expire within six years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rentals if rents of existing leases are below the then existing market rate ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends between fiscal years and remained relatively unchanged 
the decrease in earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends between fiscal years and is primarily due to a decrease in gain on sale of real estate in  a decrease in income from continuing operations in fiscal year due to a decrease in rental income and tenant recoveries and other income and by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  slightly offset by a valuation provision on real estate recognized in fiscal year as discussed in results of operations above 
market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
this analysis presents the hypothetical gain or loss in earnings  cash flows or fair value of the financial instruments and derivative instruments which are held by the company at december  that are sensitive to changes in the interest rates 
while this analysis may have some use as a benchmark  it should not be viewed as a forecast 
in the normal course of business  the company also faces risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk and legal risk and are not represented in the following analysis 
at december    million approximately of total debt at december  of the company s debt was fixed rate debt and million approximately of total debt at december  was variable rate debt 
the company also has outstanding a written put option the written option  which was issued in conjunction with the initial offering of one tranche of senior unsecured debt 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt  but not earnings or cash flows of the company 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in the interest rate generally do not impact the fair value of the debt  but would affect the company s future earnings and cash flows 
the interest rate risk and changes in fair market value of fixed rate debt generally do not have a significant impact on the company until the company is required to refinance such debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the maturity dates of the company s various fixed rate debt 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december   a increase or decrease in the interest rate on the company s variable rate debt would decrease or increase  respectively  future net income and cash flows by approximately 
million per year 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  by approximately million to  million 
a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  by approximately million to  million 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the written option at december  by approximately million to million 
a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the written option at december  by approximately million to million

other in january  the fasb issued fin  which provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determines when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie are to be included in an entity s consolidated financial statements 
a vie exists when either the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities by itself  or the equity investors lack one of three characteristics associated with owning a controlling financial interest 
in december  the fasb reissued fin with certain modifications and clarifications 
application of this guidance was effective for interests in certain vies commonly referred to as special purpose entities spes as of december  application for all other types of entities is required for periods ending after march   unless previously applied 
the company does not believe that the application of fin will have an impact on its financial position  results of operations  or liquidity

risk factors the company s operations involve various risks that could adversely affect its financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  ability to pay distributions on its common stock and the market price of its common stock 
these risks  among others contained in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission  include real estate investments value fluctuates depending on conditions in the general economy and the real estate business 
these conditions may limit the company s revenues and available cash 
the factors that affect the value of the company s real estate and the revenues the company derives from its properties include  among other things general economic climate  local conditions such as oversupply or a reduction in demand in the area  the attractiveness of the properties to tenants  tenant defaults  zoning or other regulatory restrictions  competition from other available real estate  our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance  and increased operating costs  including insurance premiums and real estate taxes 
many real estate costs are fixed  even if income from properties decreases 
the company s financial results depend on leasing space in the company s real estate properties to tenants on terms favorable to the company 
the company s income and funds available for distribution to its stockholders will decrease if a significant number of the company s tenants cannot pay their rent or the company is unable to rent properties on favorable terms 
in addition  if a tenant does not pay its rent  the company might not be able to enforce its rights as landlord without delays and the company might incur substantial legal costs 
costs associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s gross revenues from continuing operations came from rentals of real property 
the company may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly and  therefore  will tend to limit the company s ability to vary its property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
the inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of the company s property portfolio could adversely affect the company s financial condition and ability to service debt and make distributions to its stockholders 
in addition  like other companies qualifying as reits under the internal revenue code  the company must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of properties disposed of in a year  their tax bases and the cost of improvements made to the properties  or meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
thus  the company s ability at any time to sell assets may be restricted 
the company may be unable to sell properties on advantageous terms 
the company has sold to third parties a significant number of properties in recent years and  as part of its business  the company intends to continue to sell properties to third parties 
the company s ability to sell properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond the company s control  including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of the company s properties 
if the company is unable to sell properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property sales in accordance with the company s business strategy  then the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  the company s common stock could be adversely affected 
the company has also sold to its joint ventures a significant number of properties in recent years and  as part of its business  the company intends to continue to sell properties to its joint ventures as opportunities arise 
if the company does not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future joint ventures  or if the joint ventures have reduced or no access to capital on favorable terms  then such sales could be delayed or prevented  adversely affecting the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  the company s common stock 
for the year ended december   gains on sales of properties accounted for approximately of the company s net income 
the company may be unable to acquire properties on advantageous terms or acquisitions may not perform as the company expects 
the company acquires and intends to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties 
the acquisition of properties entails various risks  including the risks that the company s investments may not perform as expected and that the company s cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate 
further  the company faces significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other well capitalized real estate investors  including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private investors 
this competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment 
as a result of competition  the company may be unable to acquire additional properties as it desires or the purchase price may be significantly elevated 
in addition  the company expects to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under the company s unsecured line of credit  proceeds from equity or debt offerings by the company and proceeds from property sales  which may not be available and which could adversely affect the company s cash flow 
any of the above risks could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  the company s common stock 
the company may be unable to complete development and re development projects on advantageous terms 
as part of its business  the company develops new and re develops existing properties 
in addition  the company has sold to third parties or sold to the company s joint ventures a significant number of development and re development properties in recent years and the company intends to continue to sell such properties to third parties or to sell such properties to the company s joint ventures as opportunities arise 
the real estate development and re development business involves significant risks that could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of the company s common stock  which include the company may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms and complete construction on schedule or within budget  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and generating cash flow  the company may not be able to obtain  or may experience delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations  the properties may perform below anticipated levels  producing cash flow below budgeted amounts and limiting the company s ability to sell such properties to third parties or to sell such properties to the company s joint ventures  the company may be unable to renew leases or find other lessees 
the company is subject to the risks that  upon expiration  leases may not be renewed  the space subject to such leases may not be relet or the terms of renewal or reletting  including the cost of required renovations  may be less favorable than expiring lease terms 
if the company were unable to promptly renew a significant number of expiring leases or to promptly relet the space covered by such leases  or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting were significantly lower than the then current rates  the company s cash funds from operations and ability to make expected distributions to stockholders might be adversely affected 
as of december   leases with respect to approximately million  million and million square feet of gla  representing  and  of gla expire in the remainder of  and  respectively 
the company might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 
first industrial realty trust  inc intends to operate so as to qualify as a reit under the code 
although the company believes that first industrial realty trust  inc is organized and will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a reit  qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements  some of which must be met on a recurring basis 
these requirements are established under highly technical and complex code provisions of which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations  and involve the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company s control 
if first industrial realty trust  inc were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  first industrial realty trust  inc would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on first industrial realty trust  inc s taxable income at corporate rates 
this could result in a discontinuation or substantial reduction in dividends to stockholders 
unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  first industrial realty trust  inc also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years that follow 
certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income  resulting in a penalty tax on the gain attributable to the transaction 
as part of its business  the company sells properties to third parties or sells properties to the company s joint ventures as opportunities arise 
under the code  a penalty tax could be assessed on the gain resulting from sales of properties that are deemed to be prohibited transactions 
the question of what constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction 
the internal revenue service could contend that certain sales of properties by the company are prohibited transactions 
while the company s management does not believe that the internal revenue service would prevail in such a dispute  if the matter was successfully argued by the internal revenue service  the penalty tax could be assessed against the profits from these transactions 
in addition  any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect the company s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 
the reit distribution requirements may require the company to turn to external financing sources 
first industrial realty trust  inc could  in certain instances  have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable first industrial realty trust  inc to meet the distribution requirements of the reit provisions of the code 
in that situation  the company could be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet those distribution requirements 
in addition  because first industrial realty trust  inc must distribute to its stockholders at least of the company s reit taxable income each year  the company s ability to accumulate capital may be limited 
thus  in connection with future acquisitions  first industrial realty trust  inc may be more dependent on outside sources of financing  such as debt financing or issuances of additional capital stock  which may or may not be available on favorable terms 
additional debt financings may substantially increase the company s leverage and additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests 
debt financing  the degree of leverage and rising interest rates could reduce the company s cash flow 
where possible  the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company s investments and to allow the company to make more investments than it otherwise could 
the company s use of leverage presents an additional element of risk in the event that the cash flow from the company s properties is insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the reit provisions of the code 
in addition  rising interest rates would reduce the company s cash flow by increasing the amount of interest due on its floating rate debt and on its fixed rate debt as it matures and is refinanced 
cross collateralization of mortgage loans could result in foreclosure on substantially all of the company s properties if the company is unable to service its indebtedness 
if the operating partnership determines to obtain additional debt financing in the future  it may do so through mortgages on some or all of its properties 
these mortgages may be on recourse  non recourse or cross collateralized bases 
cross collateralization makes all of the subject properties available to the lender in order to satisfy the company s debt 
holders of indebtedness that is so secured will have a claim against these properties 
to the extent indebtedness is cross collateralized  lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties that are not the primary collateral for their loan  which may  in turn  result in acceleration of other indebtedness secured by properties 
foreclosure of properties would result in a loss of income and asset value to the company  making it difficult for it to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the reit provisions of the code 
as of december   none of the company s current indebtedness was cross collateralized 
the company may have to make lump sum payments on its existing indebtedness 
the company is required to make the following lump sum or balloon payments under the terms of some of its indebtedness  including the operating partnership s million aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes million aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes approximately million aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes million aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes million aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes million aggregate principal amount of notes due the trust notes the trust to which the trust notes were issued must exercise its right to require the company  through the operating partnership  to redeem the trust notes on may  if the holder of a call option with respect to the trust notes fails to give written notice on or before may  that it intends to exercise such option 
million aggregate principal amount of our notes due the notes million aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes million aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes million aggregate principal amount of notes due the notes and a million unsecured revolving credit facility the unsecured line of credit under which first industrial realty trust  inc  through the operating partnership  may borrow to finance the acquisition of additional properties and for other corporate purposes  including working capital 
the unsecured line of credit provides for the repayment of principal in a lump sum or balloon payment at maturity in under the unsecured line of credit  the operating partnership has the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase the aggregate commitment under the unsecured line of credit by up to million 
as of december   million was outstanding under the unsecured line of credit at a weighted average interest rate of 
the company s ability to make required payments of principal on outstanding indebtedness  whether at maturity or otherwise  may depend on its ability either to refinance the applicable indebtedness or to sell properties 
the company has no commitments to refinance the notes  the notes  the notes  the notes  the notes  the trust notes  the notes  the notes  the notes  the notes or the unsecured line of credit 
some of the existing debt obligations  other than those discussed above  of the company  through the operating partnership  are secured by the company s properties  and therefore such obligations will permit the lender to foreclose on those properties in the event of a default 
there is no limitation on debt in the company s organizational documents 
the organizational documents of first industrial realty trust  inc do not contain any limitation on the amount or percentage of indebtedness the company may incur 
accordingly  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the company s ability to make expected distributions to stockholders and in an increased risk of default on the company s obligations 
as of december   the company s ratio of debt to its total market capitalization was 
the company computes that percentage by calculating its total consolidated debt as a percentage of the aggregate market value of all outstanding shares of the company s common stock  assuming the exchange of all limited partnership units of the operating partnership for common stock  plus the aggregate stated value of all outstanding shares of preferred stock and total consolidated debt 
rising interest rates on the company s unsecured line of credit could decrease the company s available cash 
the company s unsecured line of credit bears interest at a floating rate 
as of december   the company s unsecured line of credit had an outstanding balance of million at a weighted average interest rate of 
currently  the company s unsecured line of credit bears interest at the prime rate or at the london interbank offered rate plus 
based on an outstanding balance on our unsecured line of credit as of december   a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by 
million on an annual basis 
increases in the interest rate payable on balances outstanding under the unsecured line of credit would decrease the company s cash available for distribution to stockholders 
earnings and cash dividends  asset value and market interest rates affect the price of the company s common stock 
as a real estate investment trust  the market value of the company s common stock  in general  is based primarily upon the market s perception of the company s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends 
the market value of the company s common stock is based secondarily upon the market value of the company s underlying real estate assets 
for this reason  shares of the company s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share 
to the extent that the company retains operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves  or other purposes  these retained funds  while increasing the value of the company s underlying assets  may not correspondingly increase the market price of the company s common stock 
the company s failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
further  the distribution yield on the common stock as a percentage of the price of the common stock relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of the company s common stock 
an increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of the company s common stock to expect a higher distribution yield  which would adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
additionally  if the market price of the company s common stock declines significantly  then the company might breach certain covenants with respect to its debt obligations  which could adversely affect the company s liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and the company s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders 
the company may incur unanticipated costs and liabilities due to environmental problems 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of clean up of certain conditions relating to the presence of hazardous or toxic materials on  in or emanating from the property  and any related damages to natural resources 
environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic materials 
the presence of such materials  or the failure to address those conditions properly  may adversely affect the ability to rent or sell the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 
persons who dispose of or arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic materials may also be liable for the costs of clean up of such materials  or for related natural resource damages  at or from an off site disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is owned or operated by those persons 
no assurance can be given that existing environmental assessments with respect to any of the company s properties reveal all environmental liabilities  that any prior owner or operator of any of the properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of the company s properties 
the company s insurance coverage does not include all potential losses 
the company currently carries comprehensive insurance coverage including property  boiler machinery  liability  fire  flood  terrorism  earthquake  extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of the company s properties and their business operations are located 
the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties and business activities 
the company believes its properties are adequately insured 
however  there are certain losses  including losses from earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  pollution  acts of war  acts of terrorism or riots  that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed to be economically feasible or prudent to do so 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of the company s properties  the company could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties  and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property
