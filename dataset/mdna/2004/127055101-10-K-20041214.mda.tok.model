item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary factors that may affect future results and forward looking statements this report on form k contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about cabot s businesses and the industries in which we operate 
these forward looking statements include statements relating to our expected financial position  business  business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  management s projections and expectations of future profits  the possible achievement of cabot s financial goals and objectives  management s expectations for shareholder value creation initiatives and for cabot s product development programs  environmental matters and the outcome of legal proceedings 
from time to time  we also provide forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public and in oral statements made by authorized officers 
forward looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as may  should  will  could  estimates  predicts  potential  continue  anticipates  believes  plans  expects  future  intends and similar expressions whether in the negative or affirmative 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties  potentially inaccurate assumptions  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict 
if known or unknown risks materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  our actual results could differ materially from past results and from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
investors are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures cabot makes on related subjects in its q and k reports filed with the sec 
also note that  as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of  we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our businesses 
these are factors that  individually or in the aggregate  we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results 
it is not possible  however  to predict or identify all such factors 
accordingly  investors should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
demand for our products on a worldwide basis could affect our future performance 
cabot s key customers in mature carbon black markets such as north america and europe continue to shift their manufacturing capacity from those regions to developing regions such as asia  south america and eastern europe 
although we are responding to meet these market demand conditions  there is no assurance that we will be successful 
similarly  demand for our customers products and our competitors reactions to market conditions could affect our results 
our chemical business is sensitive to industry capacity utilization 
as a result  pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within the industry in which our chemical business operates  which could affect our financial performance 
our success in strengthening relationships and growing business with our largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect our future results 
five major tire and rubber customers  one silicone customer  three capacitor materials customers and one microelectronics customer represent a material portion of cabot s total net sales and operating revenues 
in fiscal year  sales to the goodyear tire and rubber company by cabot s chemical business amounted to approximately of our consolidated revenues 
the loss of any one or more of our important customers could adversely affect our results of operations until such business is replaced 
in addition  any deterioration of the financial condition of any of our customers that impairs their ability to make payments to us could affect our future results and financial condition 
a material portion of our sales are made to customers under long term contracts 
the loss or expiration of any of these customer contracts could increase the volatility of our business results 
the cost  availability and quality of raw materials affect our results 
dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials at acceptable costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  if proposed environmental regulations applicable to the european carbon black industry that call for a reduction in the annual average sulfur content in carbon black feedstock are adopted  we may experience some difficulty obtaining low sulfur feedstock at an acceptable cost for our european operations 
we have manufacturing and marketing operations throughout the world  with approximately of our revenues in attributable to sales outside the united states 
we are  therefore  exposed to certain risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political or country risks inherent in doing business in some countries 
the political risks may include actions of governments especially newly appointed governments  importing and exporting issues  contract loss and asset abandonment 
in particular  our business could be affected by political uncertainty within the asia pacific and south american regions 
we consider these currency and political risks carefully in connection with our investment and operations activities 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note v of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information about foreign currency risk 
the risk management discussion included in the md a and estimated amounts generated from the analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the methods used by cabot to assess and mitigate risks should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
we have undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies and generate cost savings 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or that the estimated operating efficiences or cost savings from such activities will be realized 
in addition to cost reduction initiatives  we try to improve margins on our non contracted sales through price increases 
however  such increases may not be accepted by our customers  may not be sufficient to compensate for increased raw material and energy costs  or may negatively affect demand and volume 
our strategic focus includes optimizing our core businesses and investing the cash and intellectual resources they generate in developing new businesses 
there can be no assurance that the costs incurred investing in these new businesses will result in a proportional increase in revenues or profits 
in addition  the timely commercialization of products under development by cabot  which may be disrupted or delayed by technical difficulties  market acceptance  competitors new products  as well as difficulties in moving from the experimental stage to the production stage  could affect our future results 
as part of our strategies for growth and improved profitability  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments and enter into joint ventures 
the completion of such transactions is subject to receiving on a timely basis necessary regulatory and other consents and approvals  which could be delayed for a variety of reasons 
the completion of such transactions could also be delayed by the satisfactory negotiation of transaction documents and the fulfillment of closing conditions to the transactions 
also  there can be no assurance that such transactions will be successfully completed on a timely and cost efficient basis or that they will achieve anticipated operating earnings 
our facilities and businesses are subject to complex safety  health and environmental requirements 
we spend  and will continue to spend  significant amounts to comply with such requirements  which could adversely affect our profitability 
as more fully described in item safety  health and environment  cabot has been named as a potentially responsible party under the us superfund law and comparable state statutes with respect to several sites 
during the next several years  as remediation of various environmental sites is carried out  we expect to spend a significant portion of our environmental reserve for costs associated with such remediation 
we anticipate that the expenditures at these superfund sites will be made over a number of years  and will not be concentrated in any one year 
however  we may also incur future costs relating to sites that are not currently known to us or as to which it is currently not possible to make an estimate 
as described in item safety  health and environment  since the mid s  various state  federal and foreign agencies have taken actions to address concerns that carbon black might be carcinogenic 
we expect the international agency for research on cancer iarc to review the classification of carbon black regarding carcinogenicity over the next two years  and as a result  it is possible that iarc could change the classification of carbon black from possible human carcinogen to probable human carcinogen 
in the event iarc does change the classification of carbon black to probable human carcinogen group a  this change would impose additional labeling and other hazard communication requirements on cabot 
we are not able to predict what other impacts would be associated with reclassification of carbon black to group a 
it is possible that such a reclassification could lead customers to evaluate possible substitutes to the use of carbon black in their products and it could lead regulators to consider changing the occupational exposure limits for carbon black 
as more fully described in item legal proceedings  cabot is a party to or the subject of lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including those involving contract  environmental  antitrust  and health and safety matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis  silicosis and berylliosis 
adverse rulings  judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation including carbon black antitrust claims and liabilities associated with respirator claims or the outcome of pending governmental investigations including investigations of the carbon black industry by governmental antitrust authorities could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward looking statements 
we own and are a licensee of various patents covering many of our products  as well as processes and product uses 
nonetheless  there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that our products  processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
these claims  even if they are without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose such claims  we could be subject to injunctions or damages or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available to cabot on acceptable terms or at all 
beginning with the fiscal year ending september   in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  we will be required to evaluate and report on our systems of internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest on our assessment of the company s internal control environment and its operating effectiveness 
during fiscal year  we began taking actions to ensure that we meet the extensive requirements under section to date  we have begun documenting our processes and controls and have begun assessments of our controls 
the results of our assessment and our independent registered public accounting firm s attestation will not be reported until the end of fiscal year a negative assessment and opinion could impact the market price of our stock 
in addition to the factors described above  the following other factors  among others  could affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward looking statements changes in the rate of economic growth in the united states and other major international economies  changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies throughout the world  fluctuations in interest rates  stock market conditions  acts of war and terrorist activities  and the impact of global health and safety concerns on economic conditions and market opportunities 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgement and if different estimates and assumptions were used  the result could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which establishes criteria which must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of our accounts receivable and other economic information on both a historical and prospective basis 
additionally  we estimate sales returns based on historical trends in our customers product returns 
while such non collections and product returns have not been historically significant  if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our previous experience  or actual future returns do not reflect historical trends  our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due us and our sales would be adversely affected 
we offer sales discounts and volume rebates to certain customers 
we prepare estimates for these discounts and rebates based primarily on historical experience and contractual obligations updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
if sales are significantly different from our historical experience or contractual obligations are not met  our estimates would be adversely affected 
we primarily derive our revenues from the sale of specialty chemicals  tantalum and related products and from the rental and sale of cesium formate 
revenue from product sales is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenue from the rental of cesium formate is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental amount 
customers are also billed and revenue is recognized  typically at the end of the job  for cesium formate product that is not returned 
other operating revenues  which represent less than ten percent of total revenues  include tolling  servicing and royalties for licensed technology 
under certain multi year supply contracts with declining prices and minimum volumes  we recognize revenue based on the estimated average selling price over the contract lives 
at september  and  we had deferred revenue of approximately million and million  respectively  related to certain supply agreements representing the difference between the billed price and the estimated average selling price 
the deferred revenue will be recognized over the remaining life of the contracts  as customers purchase the contracted minimum volumes through inventory valuation the cost of most raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
had we used the first in  first out fifo method instead of the lifo method for such inventories the value of those inventories would have been million higher as of september  the cost of other us and all non us inventories is determined using the average cost method or the fifo method 
in cases where the market value of inventories is below cost  the inventory is stated at market value 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete  unmarketable inventory or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
such write downs have not historically been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative impact on gross profit 
valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  long term investments  goodwill  other intangible assets and assets held for rent 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the way the asset is being used  a decline in the physical condition of the asset  or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
we consider various estimates and assumptions when determining if there is an impairment of our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and long term investments 
these estimates and assumptions include determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which the cash flows will occur  their amounts and the assets residual value  if any 
an asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated cash flows  as determined by the difference in the carrying value and the fair value 
our estimated cash flows reflect management s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
in circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded when cabot abandons the asset 
we perform an impairment test for goodwill at least annually and when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test for recoverability  the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on discounted cash flows 
the calculation is sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows and the discount rate 
the assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flows include management s best estimates about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  future growth rates  capital expenditures and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital that is determined by evaluating the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
if an impairment exists  a loss to write down the value of goodwill to its implied fair value is recorded 
the fair values of long term investments are dependent on the financial performance of the entities in which the company invests and the external factors inherent in the markets in which they operate 
we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investment entities when assessing the potential impairment of these investments 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees 
in addition  we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
the assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans  are related to general economic conditions  including interest rates  expected return on plan assets  and the rate of compensation increases for employees 
projected health care benefits reflect our assumptions about health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
litigation and contingencies cabot is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury and environmental litigation 
we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information  including claims  settlement offers  demands by government agencies  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute and our prior experience 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
the most significant reserves that have been established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims 
as of september   we had million reserved for various environmental matters 
the amount accrued reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
a portion of the reserve for environmental matters is recognized on a discounted basis  which requires the use of an estimated discount rate 
these liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information  changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in applicable government laws and regulations  which could result in higher or lower costs 
as of september   we had million accrued for respirator liability claims 
our current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time 
however  this cost is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
developments that could affect our estimate include  but are not limited to  i significant changes in the number of future claims  ii significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims  iii significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims  iv changes in the nature of claims received  v changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims  vi the financial viability of other parties who contribute to the settlement of respirator claims  and vii a determination that our interpretation of the contractual obligations on which we have estimated our share of liability is inaccurate 
we cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims 
accordingly  the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount 
income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we are subject to tax 
this process involves estimating the tax exposure for differences between actual results and estimated results and recording the amount of income taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences 
we have filed our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction s tax laws and have established reserves for potential differences in interpretation of those laws 
in the event that actual results are significantly different from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be significantly impacted 
a change in the effective tax rate would change income tax expense by million as of september  significant accounting policies we have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in note a of the notes to our consolidated financial statement in item below 
certain of these policies include the use of estimates  but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgements that are as difficult or subjective to measure 
however  these policies are important to the understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations cabot is organized into three reportable segments the chemical business  the supermetals business csm  and the specialty fluids business csf 
the chemical business is primarily comprised of the carbon black  fumed metal oxides  inkjet colorants  and aerogels product lines as well as the business development activities of superior micropowders 
the following discussion of results includes diluted earnings per share  segment and product line sales  and segment operating profit before taxes pbt 
we use segment pbt to measure our consolidated operating results and assess segment performance 
the following discussion has been prepared on a basis consistent with segment reporting as outlined in note x of the consolidated financial statements 
refer to note x of the consolidated financial statements for a definition of segment pbt and additional segment information 
the following analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended september net sales and operating profit before taxes by segment are shown in note x of the consolidated financial statements 
overview cabot s strategy is based on three key principles maximize the results of our core products carbon black  fumed metal oxides and tantalum  invest in the development and growth of our new products and businesses inkjet colorants  cesium formate  aerogels and superior micropowders  and focus on continuously improving our operating efficiency and cost performance 
the demand for carbon black  the company s principal product  is driven primarily by vehicle miles driven and general economic conditions which influence the consumption of products that are produced using carbon black 
carbon black pricing is largely driven by a combination of the price of raw materials  principally petrochemical derivatives  and regional and global capacity utilization in the carbon black industry 
demand for fumed metal oxides is largely driven by the construction  automotive and electronics industries as well as general consumer product growth 
pricing is primarily determined by the terms of long term contracts  and for non contracted customers  by capacity utilization in the fumed silica industry 
tantalum demand is largely driven by changes in the electronics industry 
in recent years  our pricing has largely been determined by the terms of several long term contracts 
beginning in  a greater portion of our sales began to transition from fixed contract to market based prices 
inkjet colorants demand is largely driven by growth in the number of pages printed using pigment based inkjet technology as well as the penetration of inkjet printing into new markets 
currently  pricing is determined by negotiation with individual customers and is based on the perceived value of our products 
cesium formate demand is primarily driven by the level of drilling of high pressure  high temperature wells and the petroleum industry s acceptance of our product in this application 
pricing is primarily based on negotiation on a project by project basis 
aerogels and superior micropowders are both in their early formative stages and do not currently generate material revenue 
over the past several years  key determinates of profitability for the company have included improving macroeconomic conditions  which in led to high capacity utilization levels in both our carbon black and fumed metal oxides manufacturing facilities  fluctuations in raw material and energy costs  the ability to obtain sales price increases for our products necessary to preserve our margins  the impact of customer contracts in the supermetals business  and the result of company wide efforts to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs 
in  our gross profit was positively impacted by approximately million compared to  generally due to higher selling prices and lower operating costs derived in part from the excellence initiative we undertook in to improve our overall operating performance 
in  our gross profit was roughly the same as in  although the chemical business operated in a particularly difficult environment in because of high raw material prices and low industry capacity utilization 
in the past several years  the company has recorded certain items  consisting mainly of impairment and restructuring charges 
in  the company recognized million of investment impairment and restructuring charges 
certain items amounted to approximately million in principally due to restructuring in our european region resulting in both a plant closure and the development of a shared services organization  as well as an impairment charge related to our investment in sons of gwalia 
further detail is provided in the company summary below 
in addition  we have made a number of capital spending commitments which demonstrates our view of the importance of developing capacity in emerging markets where our customers are increasing their manufacturing activities 
these commitments include an announced expansion at our plant in brazil and new plants for both carbon black and fumed metal oxides in china 
we also continue to emphasize our commitment to research and development initiatives and new product development  including continued investment in our aerogels product line and in the activities associated with superior micropowders 
we anticipate profitability and operating cash flows to remain strong in due to the generally improved economic conditions and high capacity utilization in the chemical business 
a focus on continuing to improve our cost position and our ability to leverage tight supply markets will be key drivers of profitability 
our sales for  and were  million   million and  million  respectively 
in  increased volumes in carbon black  fumed silica  inkjet colorants and specialty fluids as well as positive currency translations to us dollars primarily contributed to the increase in sales 
percentage of total sales segment sales chemical business supermetals business specialty fluids business sales by geographic region north america europe south america asia pacific versus a strong focus on cost savings and productivity improvements through the company s excellence initiative as well as improving macroeconomic conditions significantly benefited the company in resulting in a significant increase in earnings 
increasing demand and capacity utilization during the year resulted in stronger performance for the chemical business 
strong growth continued in emerging markets  particularly in the asia pacific and south american regions 
sales and profits in the supermetals business significantly decreased versus due to lower sales of intermediate semi finished products resulting from the expiration of a portion of a customer contract at the end of the business was able to partially offset these lost volumes and profits with additional sales of finished tantalum  which increased by approximately approximately million in revenue as well as by lowering its operating costs 
the specialty fluids business exhibited strong growth in both volumes and profits during the year with a greater number of completed jobs as well as larger sized jobs 
versus the chemical business operated in a difficult environment during high raw material costs and competitive price pressure in the non contracted business from low industry capacity utilization levels resulted in decreased margins compared to slightly higher volumes  positive currency translations to us dollars  and lower inventory costs partly offset the impact of lower margins 
volumes in the supermetals business were approximately higher in than in approximately million in revenues due to the resolution of customer contract disputes 
csm average prices were flat as improved product mix was offset by reduced prices in asia and lower contract prices related to the resolution of customer contract disputes 
improved manufacturing utilization  however  positively impacted results in csm 
cabot specialty fluids sales decreased compared to due to lower north sea drilling activity 
company summary summary of earnings set forth below is a summary of our earnings for fiscal years  and diluted earnings per share after tax charges per share for certain items and discontinued operations charges from certain items on a pre tax basis are detailed in the company summary section below 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations before income taxes was million in  a increase from million in in  income from continuing operations before income taxes was million 
results in included million of pre tax charges for certain items  which are detailed in the table below  compared with million in and million in results in benefited from a greater focus on cost and productivity improvements and improving macroeconomic conditions 
these benefits were partly reduced by lower results in supermetals due to the loss of contracted sales of intermediate semi finished products as well as by the certain items noted below 
the following table highlights the detail of certain items before tax 
dollars in millions certain items before income taxes investment impairment charges reserve for respirator claims restructuring initiatives insurance recoveries environmental reserve in process research and development asset impairment charges sale of equity interest other non operating items certain items amounts per diluted common share after tax the following table delineates where the total of certain items are classified in our consolidated statements of income 
dollars in millions certain items represented in the various lines of the consolidated statements of income cost of sales selling and administrative expenses research and technical service other income expense certain items before income taxes gross profits gross profit increased by million in from due to the net impact of volume changes in the chemical  specialty fluids and supermetals businesses approximately million impact  cost improvements of approximately million resulting from our excellence initiative and a decrease in charges from certain items included in cost of sales of million 
the decrease in charges from certain items in was mostly due to restructuring costs related to the closure of the zierbena  spain carbon black plant  the consolidation of administrative services for the european businesses into one shared service center and a reduction in workforce in north america 
partly offsetting these benefits in was unfavorable product mix approximately million 
in  gross profit declined by million from due to weaker margins in the chemical business  resulting from high raw material costs and competitive price pressure in the non contracted business as a result of low capacity utilization  as well as million of certain items included in cost of sales  mostly relating to the restructuring costs described above 
these declines were partially offset by a increase in tantalum volumes from  which represented an approximately million increase in profit  resulting in large part from the resolution of customer contract disputes 
operating expenses and other incomes and expenses operating expenses include research and technical expense and selling and administrative expenses 
research and technical spending decreased million in versus primarily due to million of in process research and development in related to the purchase of superior micropowders 
this represented the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development technology that was immediately expensed and recorded in research and technical expense 
selling and administrative expenses for   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the million decrease in is due primarily to the inclusion in of million of certain items related to european and north american restructurings and respirator reserve charges partly offset by insurance recoveries 
interest and dividend income of million in was million greater than  primarily due to an increase in our average cash position and the positive impact of higher interest rates paid on our cash balances 
interest expense of million in was million higher than due to the issuance of million of ten year bonds in september at fixed rates which replaced a lower floating rate bank debt 
in  other income and charges changed by million from million of income in to million of charges in this change is mainly due to a million write down of the company s investment in sons of gwalia included in certain items as well as million of charges related to currency translation adjustments included in certain items in other income and charges in included the gain on the sale of the company s equity interest in aearo corporation for million 
this income was partially offset by the write down of investments in sons of gwalia and angus ross for million and costs associated with the refinancing of debt 
income taxes the effective tax rate on continuing operations was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal as described in note s of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the income tax rates reflect the us statutory rate of increased by a charge for a valuation allowance on the sons of gwalia investment loss and reduced for earnings in non us jurisdictions that were taxed at rates lower than the non us rate  benefits from extraterritorial income exclusion  benefits from us research and experimentation credits  and the benefit from a competent authority filing resolved in competent authority is an administrative procedure provided in tax treaties to mitigate the potential double taxation arising from audit adjustments made by one tax jurisdiction with respect to cross border transactions 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was principally the result of an increase in earnings in certain jurisdictions and the impact of these higher earnings on fixed dollar tax savings 
the company expects its effective tax rate on operating earnings for fiscal to be in a range between and exclusive of the impact of tax audit adjustments 
in the normal course of business  our tax filings are examined by various tax authorities  including the internal revenue services irs 
in october  the irs concluded its examination of the to tax years resulting in an initial tax assessment of million 
there were certain issues that were unresolved and protested by cabot to the appeals office of the irs 
in september  a settlement of these issues was reached with appeals that reduced the assessment to million subject to joint committee review 
additionally  we filed refund claims with the irs for million including million of interest for the carryback of research and foreign tax credits from the periods under examination into the and tax years 
the refund claims were examined by the irs and will be reviewed by joint committee along with the irs audit settlement 
we recorded the benefit of the credits in our financial statements in the years generated  but have not yet accrued the interest 
we expect the joint committee review to be completed during fiscal although the result of this review cannot presently be determined  management anticipates a favorable outcome  which would materially impact our effective tax rate in given the unrecorded interest income on the refund claim and previously recorded tax reserves 
in addition  we are presently under review or in settlement discussions with a number of non us tax authorities that we expect to resolve during in october  the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income 
we are both an exporter and a domestic manufacturer 
our loss of the export incentive tax benefit is expected to exceed the tax benefit we have received from the domestic manufacturing deduction 
however  because the irs has not yet issued guidance for implementing the ajca  we cannot estimate the magnitude of the net impact of the law on cabot s taxes 
the ajca also allows us companies to repatriate up to million of earnings from their foreign subsidiaries in or at an effective tax rate of 
we have not decided whether to take advantage of this opportunity  nor have we determined whether there is a material benefit available  given our particular circumstances and the various requirements under the law 
we will continue to study the impact of the ajca  as additional guidance becomes available from the irs 
in response  the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued a proposed staff positions  fsps a and b  which proposes accounting treatment for the impacts of the ajca 
the fsps propose that any benefit that companies may have from the domestic manufacturing deduction be treated as a special deduction and accordingly any benefit would be reported in the year in which the income is earned and regarding the impact resulting from the repatriation of unremitted earnings in the period in which the enacted tax law was passed  companies may wait until they have the information necessary to determine the amount of the earnings they intend to repatriate 
these fsps are expected to be finalized later in december equity in net income of affiliates our share of earnings from equity affiliates of million in was million higher than the prior year due to improved operating results in our affiliates in mexico and venezula offset by a decrease in results from our affiliate in malaysia 
discontinued operations in fiscal  we recorded income of million  or per diluted common share  related to previously divested businesses 
this amount consists of million related to insurance proceeds and million related to the reversal of tax reserves related to previously divested businesses

segment pbt increased primarily due to improved volumes approximately million and lower costs resulting from our excellence initiative approximately million 
these increases were somewhat offset by lower average prices approximately million resulting from product mix and an increasing proportion of sales in emerging regions where prices are lower 
in  sales increased over  primarily as a result of increased pricing on long term carbon black contract business due to higher raw material costs as well as positive currency translation related to the stronger euro 
segment pbt decreased due to lower operating margins resulting from the company s inability to increase prices on non contract business during a period of rising raw material costs and low industry capacity utilization 
in addition  segment pbt declined due to an million increase in aerogel costs associated with refining the manufacturing process and developing commercial markets for this emerging business 
these declines were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange million and the cost benefit of increased inventories during the year million 
product line summary carbon black carbon black volumes increased by in as a result of continuing growth in the asia pacific region  increasing volumes under a new contract with an existing large tire customer  and recovering macroeconomic conditions 
these volume increases and a strong focus on both manufacturing and administration cost reductions during the year contributed to a significant improvement in the performance of the business 
as a result of these factors  carbon black pbt increased by compared to fumed metal oxides fumed metal oxides had strong volume growth of during due to improved demand in all markets 
this volume growth and improved product mix were the primary contributors to a increase in fumed metal oxides pbt over the results also benefited from cost savings related to our excellence program 
inkjet colorants inkjet colorants had a strong year due primarily to significant volume increases across all markets 
ongoing investment in both research development and manufacturing continued in to support the future growth of the business 
inkjet colorants pbt increased by over aerogels in the aerogels business  the company continued to make progress in refining the manufacturing process in its semi works facility in frankfurt  germany during the business continues to market its products for translucent panels in architectural applications and to develop other commercial applications 
outlook for we remain optimistic regarding the outlook for the chemical business 
demand is strong across all product lines and capacity utilization continues to be high in all regions 
the migration of some of our customers manufacturing to lower cost regions continues  and as a result we have announced our intention to expand carbon black capacity in brazil and to construct new plants for both carbon black and fumed silica in china 
we expect the inkjet business to continue to experience strong volume growth with its additional oem customer relationship  but both r d and manufacturing expenditures will remain high in order to position the business for continued long term growth 
despite achieving the initially determined goals for our excellence initiatives  we will continue to focus diligently on cost improvements 
we expect capital expenditures in the chemical business to increase significantly in due to major construction projects in brazil and china 
supermetals business the following table sets forth sales and pbt for the supermetals business for   and dollars in millions segment sales segment pbt in  segment sales and segment pbt were both negatively impacted by the absence of intermediate semi finished product sales approximately million of revenue and a greater portion of tantalum powder sales being at market prices rather than at fixed contract prices 
the business was able to partially offset these impacts with additional non contracted tantalum sales approximately million of revenue 
as a result  while total tantalum volumes including semi finished products decreased by compared to  finished product tantalum volumes increased by year over year 
the business was also able to partly offset the loss of semi finished sales through reductions in operating costs related to the excellence program 
the combination of these factors caused pbt to decrease by million  or  compared to during  the business amended two customer contracts  which were due to expire beginning in the supply relationships with these customers have been extended through concerning results as compared to  segment sales and pbt were positively impacted in by the resolution of customer contract disputes relating to tantalum supply approximately million volume impact on pbt 
improved manufacturing utilization levels and lower research and development costs also contributed a total of approximately million to the improvement in segment pbt compared to outlook for we remain cautious regarding the business outlook in the supermetals business as a greater portion of our sales will transition from fixed contract prices to market based prices 
we continue to work to improve our cost competitiveness to prepare for these expected price reductions 
we believe that we are well positioned with favorable ore supply and solid manufacturing capability 
we also continue to develop capabilities in the thin films sputtering targets market 
specialty fluids business the following table sets forth sales and pbt for the specialty fluids business for   and dollars in millions segment sales segment pbt the increase in sales and pbt during was due to an increased number of jobs jobs in versus jobs in and larger sized jobs 
sales and pbt declined in compared with due to a slowdown in drilling activity in the north sea 
outlook for we anticipate ongoing growth of the specialty fluids business as we continue to supply statoil with drilling fluids under the agreement reached in  which we believe will lead to a significant number of projects over the next several years 
in addition  the business continues to actively pursue opportunities to supply its drilling fluids in other geographic regions including the gulf of mexico and saudi arabia and anticipates that this activity will begin to yield results in the upcoming fiscal year 
cash flow and liquidity cash generated in from operating activities was million  compared with million in and million in a main contributor to the decrease in operating cash in from is the change in working capital components resulting from the increase in accounts and notes receivable and inventory  which is the result of increased revenues in the increase in operating cash in is largely attributable to improvements in working capital

the facility is available through july  as of september   we had no borrowings outstanding under this arrangement 
the billion yen term loan and the revolving credit facility contain specific covenants 
the covenants include financial covenants for certain maximum indebtedness limitations and minimum cash flow requirements that would limit the amount available for future borrowings 
as of september   we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
at september   we have provided standby letters of credit totaling million  which expire in fiscal a downgrade of one level in our credit rating is not anticipated  but should it occur  it would not cause a significant impact on the commitments or sources of capital described above and would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
operating leases we have operating leases primarily comprised of leases for transportation vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  and machinery and equipment 
purchase commitments we have long term purchase commitments for raw materials with various key suppliers in the supermetals and chemical businesses

the price at which the raw materials will be purchased under the contract extension is still being negotiated and arbitrated 
accordingly  the company s purchase commitment can not be estimated and it is not included in the table above 
restructuring in may  we initiated a european restructuring plan to reduce costs  enhance customer service and create a stronger and more competitive organization 
the european restructuring initiatives are all related to the chemical business segment and included the closure of our carbon black manufacturing facility in zierbena  spain  the consolidation of administrative services for all european businesses in one shared service center  the implementation of a consistent staffing model for all manufacturing facilities in europe  and the discontinuance of two energy projects 
as of september   we expect the restructuring initiatives to result in a pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million

the closure is planned to occur in early october we are working to debottleneck certain of our asia pacific carbon black manufacturing plants in order to replace the  metric tons of production capacity in altona 
we expect the closure plan to result in an estimated pre tax charge to earnings of approximately million over the next two years 
net cash outlays related to the closure are expected to be approximately million  which includes the anticipated proceeds from the sale of certain assets 
employee benefit plans we provide defined benefit plans for us and foreign employees 
we have an unfunded status of approximately million as of september   comprised of underfunded pension plans of million and unfunded postretirement benefits of million 
in the underfunded pension plans  million is overfunded in the us plans and million is underfunded in the foreign plans 
in the unfunded postretirement plans  million is in us plans and million is in foreign plans 
we have reinsurance assets of million at september  that we have designated to fund pension obligations for a foreign plan 
these assets do not qualify as plan assets under fas no 
because they are not specifically segregated or restricted for use to fund the defined benefit plan obligation  and  accordingly  the assets are not shown in the funded status at september  the million of underfunded pension plans is comprised of the following us foreign total fair value of plan assets at september  projected benefit obligation at september  funded underfunded status at september  our significant foreign plans are in the netherlands  the united kingdom  canada and japan  which collectively represented of the consolidated fair value of foreign plan assets 
for those significant foreign plans  the fair value of assets was approximately million below the projected benefit obligation 
we contributed an aggregate amount of million in to the foreign plans and expect to contribute approximately million in to those plans 
contributions to foreign plans are made in foreign currencies and therefore are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates 
we made a contribution of million during to improve the funding of our us defined benefit plan

we anticipate that the expenditures at these sites will be made over a number of years  and will not be concentrated in any one year 
additionally  we have recorded a million reserve for respirator claims as of september  and we expect to pay approximately million over the next five years 
we have other litigation costs  including defense costs associated with the pending antitrust actions and lawsuits filed against the company in connection with certain discontinued operations  incurred in the ordinary course of business 
management expects cash on hand  cash from operations and present financing arrangements  including our unused lines of credit  to be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
newly issued and adopted accounting pronouncements cabot implemented financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of act was passed by the united states congress 
the act will be effective january  and provides medicare government subsidies for employers that sponsor retiree medical programs for prescription drugs for former employees 
this guidance was issued in may and superseded fsp adoption of this accounting standard was implemented and became effective for cabot in the fourth quarter of fiscal we have determined our us defined benefit postretirement health care plan provides a drug benefit that is actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d benefit and have determined that  under the plan s cost sharing arrangement with retirees  the subsidy will generally be used to reduce the retiree contributions 
as a result  we do not anticipate a reduction in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and there has been no change in postretirement expense 
in addition we do not expect a change in expense during fiscal due to the implementation of this fsp 
in december  the fasb released a revised version of interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin called fin r  which clarifies certain aspects of fin and provides certain entities with exemptions from requirements of fin fin r only slightly modified the variable interest model from that contained in fin and did change guidance in many other areas 
some of the difference between fin and fin r include  among others  i the addition of a scope exception for certain entities that meet the definition of a business provided that specified criteria are met  ii the addition of a scope exception in situations whereby an enterprise is unable to obtain certain information pertaining to the entity to comply with fin r  and iii the addition of a list of events that require reconsideration of whether an entity is a variable interest entity and whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  rather than stating the general principle with examples that had previously been provided 
additionally  fin r incorporates the guidance found in the eight final staff position papers that were issued as of the release of fin r 
all entities created after january  have been and will continue to be analyzed under fin fin r was implemented in the second quarter of fiscal and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cabot adopted fas no

this statement did not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by fas no 
employers accounting for pensions  fas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  or fas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf  published eitf issue eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires companies to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
this issue became effective for revenue arrangements entered into beginning cabot s fiscal year we implemented eitf at the beginning of fiscal with no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  fasb issued fas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter to improve financial reporting and global comparability of inventory accounting 
the amendment  which adopted language similar to that used in the international accounting standards board s iasb international accounting standard ias  clarifies that inventory related expenses  such as abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted or spoiled materials should be recognized as current period charges 
the statement also requires fixed production overhead allocations to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in cabot s fiscal year the adoption of fas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments  as well as new disclosure requirements including  among others  for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired  however  the disclosure requirements were effective for annual periods ending after december  the company had adopted the disclosure requirements as of september  and will continue to evaluate the application of eitf management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management market risk our principal financial risk management objective is to identify and monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates  in order to assess the impact that changes in each could have on future cash flow and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financial activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments as well as foreign currency debt 
our financial risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all instruments entered into by cabot are reviewed and approved by cabot s financial risk management committee  an internal management committee charged with enforcing cabot s financial risk management policy 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our credit risk will equal the fair value gain on the derivative 
generally  when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes cabot  thus creating a repayment risk for cabot 
we minimize the credit or repayment risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with highly rated counterparties that are reviewed periodically by us 
interest rates as of september   we had debt totaling million and interest rate swaps with a net notional value of million 
the interest rate swaps were entered into as a hedge of the underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the debt instrument 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
we use both yen based debt and cross currency swaps to hedge our net investment in japanese subsidiaries against movements in exchange rates 
we have a billion japanese yen million three year term loan agreement with a group of banks to refinance existing debt at csj 
in connection with the term loan  we entered into two interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion yen million 
the swaps are variable for fixed swaps of the quarterly interest payments on related debt and mature in fiscal the swaps are derivative instruments as defined by fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and have been designated as cash flow hedges 
these swaps hedge the variability of the cash flows caused by changes in interest rates over the life of the debt instrument 
changes in the value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income  while the ineffective portion is reported in earnings 
the swaps had positive fair values of zero and negative million on september  and  respectively  and are included in other assets 
there was no charge to earnings for the period ending september  and within the next twelve months  we do not expect to reclass any material gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings 
we have two  three year cross currency swaps  which in total swapped million at three month us libor interest rates for billion japanese yen at three month yen libor interest rates 
we receive semi annual interest payments on million at three month us dollar libor interest rates and make semi annual interest payments on billion japanese yen at three month japanese yen libor interest rates 
the cross currency swaps reduce cabot s interest rate by on the notional amount of million as of september  given rates in force as of that date 
included in other liabilities at september  and is million and million  respectively  related to the fair value of the cross currency swaps 
the change in fair value of the cross currency swaps of million for the twelve months ending september  has been recorded as a foreign currency translation loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  offsetting foreign currency translation gains of cabot s yen denominated net investments 
the effectiveness of these hedges is based on changes in the spot foreign exchange rates and the balance of cabot s yen denominated net investments 
the amount of net losses recorded in earnings for the period related to the ineffectiveness of the hedges was nominal 
the yen denominated debt has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in japan and is accounted for under fas no 
at september  and  million was included as a charge to cumulative translation adjustment with a corresponding amount in other liabilities related to the revaluation of the debt from yen to us dollar 
we have outstanding two fixed to variable interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the swaps have been designated as fair value hedges 
the interest rate swaps and the related medium term notes mature on various dates through february the fair values of the derivative instruments were million and million at september  and  respectively  and have been recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding increase to long term debt 
the interest rate swaps were determined to be highly effective and no amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings during the period ended september  and as of september  and  after adjusting for the effect of the interest rate swap agreements  we have fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively  and floating rate debt of million and million  respectively 
holding other variables constant such as exchange rates and debt levels  a basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million on september  and  respectively 
the earnings and cash flow impact in resulting from a basis point increase in short term interest rates would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
a basis point increase in global interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by million at september  and any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset  liability  or cash flow 
as of september   we had million in cash and million in readily available cash investments 
in order of priority  it is our policy to invest excess cash in instruments that will protect principal  ensure liquidity and optimize the rate of return 
interest income earned may vary as a result of changes in interest rates and average cash balances  which could fluctuate over time 
foreign currency cabot s international operations are subject to certain risks  including currency fluctuations and government actions 
our treasury function  under the guidance of the financial risk management committee  continuously monitors foreign exchange exposures  so that we can respond to changing economic and political environments 
exposures primarily relate to assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as well as the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows generated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we use short term forward contracts to minimize the exposure to foreign currency risk 
in   and  none of cabot s forward contracts were designated as hedging instruments under fas no 
cabot s forward foreign exchange contracts are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar and indonesian rupiah 
as part of the million bond issuance in september  a cabot subsidiary entered into a ten year contract with a notional amount of million to swap us dollars to euros 
this cross currency swap has been designated as a foreign currency cash flow hedge 
this swap hedges the variability of the cash flows on million or of the debt issuance  for changes in the exchange rates over the life of the debt instrument 
changes in the value of the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in other comprehensive income  while the ineffective portion is reported in earnings 
there was no charge to earnings for the period ended september  and this swap had negative fair values of million and million on september  and and is included in other liabilities 
there was no charge to earnings for the period ended september  and and we do not expect to reclass any material gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings within the next twelve months 
the cabot subsidiary also entered into two interest rate swaps in september on the remaining of the bond issuance of million 
the first was a swap on the fixed rate coupon of to the six month us libor plus a spread of basis points 
the variable interest rate on the swap resets with the terms of the bond coupon payments 
this swap has been designated as a fair value hedge and had a nominal fair value on september  and the second swap on the remaining of the bond issuance was us dollars at variable interest rates to euros at variable interest rates 
this swap also has been designated as a fair value hedge and had negative fair values of million and million on september   and  respectively  which is included in other liabilities 
the interest rate swaps were determined to be highly effective and a nominal amount of ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings during the period ended september  and we recorded zero assets and million of liabilities to recognize the fair value of currency instruments at september  compared with million of assets and million of liabilities at september  a appreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by million and million at september  and  respectively 
a depreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by million and by million at september  and  respectively 
any increase or decrease in the fair value of cabot s currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset  liability  or cash flow 
political risk we are exposed to political or country risks inherent in doing business in some countries 
these risks may include actions of governments especially those newly appointed  importing and exporting issues  contract loss and asset abandonment 
we consider these risks carefully in connection with our investment and operating activities 
share repurchases we repurchase our shares in order to offset dilution caused by issuing shares under our various employee stock plans 
in addition  we may repurchase our shares as a preferred method of returning excess cash to shareholders
