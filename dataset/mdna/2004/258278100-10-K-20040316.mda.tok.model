in addition  fourth quarter sales benefitted from over million in one time sales related to customer inventory builds and sales included million in revenues from the specialty fastener business prior to its sale in may sales growth for fiscal after adjusting for foreign exchange  the specialty fastener sale and the one time sales described above was 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  declined to in from in the overall decline in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was the net result of three primary factors 
first  production and materials cost reduction initiatives resulted in cost savings that lowered cost of sales 
this benefit page of was offset by provisions for customer credits that increased as a percentage of sales in as a result of higher customer return levels in and a sales mix shift towards more lower gross margin product sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses in were held to million  which is the same level of spending as in despite additional investments in product development resources  inflationary cost increases and sales volume growth in this was achieved through the implementation of a number of cost saving measures which reduced overhead spending

cash and short term investments as of december  totaled million 
page of over the past two years the company has extended payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands 
these extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash flow 
the company participates in an accounts receivable factoring program with one customer which allows it to sell its accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to a financial institution to offset the negative cash flow impact of the payment terms extensions it has made to date 
during  the company sold million in accounts receivable pursuant to this plan 
the company expects continued pressure to extend its payment terms for the foreseeable future 
further extensions of customer payment terms will result in additional uses of cash flow or increased interest costs 
in december  the company announced its intention to add  square feet in warehouse space to its central distribution center in warsaw  kentucky by july  the total estimated cost of the addition and fit out of the warehouse space is expected to be approximately million

the notes bear a fixed interest rate  payable quarterly 
annual principal payments of million are due each august through the notes require  among other things  that the company maintain certain financial covenants relating to debt to capital ratios and minimum net worth 
in march  the company amended its revolving credit facility 
the amended facility expires in june the march amendment reduced the total credit facility from million to million 
the size of the facility was reduced to decrease overall borrowing costs 
borrowings under the amended facility are on an unsecured basis with interest at libor plus basis points 
the loan agreement also contains covenants  the most restrictive of which pertain to net worth and the ratio of debt to ebitda 
in addition  the company s swedish subsidiary maintains a short term million credit facility 
as of december   million in standby letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings under either facility as of december  the company amended certain agreements related to its acquisition of scan tech usa sweden ab and related entities scan tech during as a result of this transaction  the company purchased and canceled  shares of its common stock issued in connection with the acquisition and canceled the earn out provisions of the acquisition agreement in exchange for consideration of million to be paid by the company in installments through december the aggregate amount outstanding under this obligation was million at december  the company s business activities do not include the use of unconsolidated special purpose entities  and there are no significant business transactions that have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
the company has future obligations for debt repayments  future minimum rental and similar commitments under noncancellable operating leases as well as contingent obligations related to outstanding letter of credit 
these obligations as of december  are summarized in the tables below payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term borrowings     operating leases     purchase obligations page of amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than other commercial commitments committed year years years over years letters of credit   represents capital commitments in connection with the warsaw  kentucky facility expansion 
operating cash flow amounted to million in fiscal  approximately million higher than the million in operating cash flow in the primary reason for the increase in cash flow in was accounts receivable  which generated million in cash in  but used million in cash in as noted above  the company has extended payment terms to certain customers over the past two years 
most of the negative cash flow impact of these terms changes took place in this  together with a sales increase in is the primary reason that accounts receivable required million in cash in accounts receivable generated million in cash in as the impact of further payment terms extensions during the year were offset by a change in sales mix and the receipt of million in proceeds from the accounts receivable factoring program discussed above 
investing activities used million of cash in the company purchases highly liquid corporate and government bonds with maturities from three months to one year to take advantage of higher earnings rates on these investments 
these investments have been classified as short term investments as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result of this decision  the company reported a net source of cash of million during the period 
additions to property  plant and equipment required million of cash in compared to million in the increase in capital additions in is primarily the result of a  square foot addition to the company s allparts brake facility 
other capital expenditures in included upgrades to information systems  purchases of equipment designed to improve operational efficiencies and scheduled equipment replacements 
financing activities required million in cash in these uses were primary related to scheduled repayments under capital lease and other debt obligations  including the second scheduled repayment of million on the company s senior notes made in august the company believes that cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations together with its available sources of capital are sufficient to meet its ongoing cash needs for the foreseeable future 
outlook the company s strategic plan provides for a continued intense focus on new product development and further expansion of its existing core businesses 
management anticipates that these efforts will result in compounded annual sales growth of between and over the next two year period 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the timing of new product introductions and orders placed by its customers 
foreign currency fluctuations in  approximately of the company s products were purchased from a variety of foreign countries 
the products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in us dollars 
accordingly  the company does not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the page of dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product 
however  the recent weakness in the dollar has resulted in pressure from several foreign suppliers to increase prices 
to the extent that the dollar decreases in value to foreign currencies in the future or the present weakness in the dollar continues for a sustained period of time  the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase 
the company makes significant purchases of product from chinese vendors 
the chinese yuan exchange rate has been fixed against the us dollar since recently  the chinese government has been under increasing pressure to revalue its currency  or to make its exchange rate more flexible 
most experts believe that the value of the yuan would increase relative to the us dollar if it was revalued or allowed to float 
such a move would most likely result in an increase in the cost of products that are purchased from china 
impact of inflation the company has not generally been adversely affected by inflation  although recently raw materials pricing pressures have become more evident 
the company believes that material cost increases could potentially be mitigated by passing along price increases to customers or through the use of alternative suppliers or resourcing purchases to other countries

the company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring trends in interest rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements
