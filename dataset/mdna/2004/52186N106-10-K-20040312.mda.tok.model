in addition to our international expansion  we established our education and training group in within this group  our schoolhouse division focuses on developing supplemental curriculum and assessment programs for pre kindergarten to th grade classrooms and on the sale of new products incorporating our core technologies and specially modified versions of our products to schools  teacher supply stores and educational products catalogs in the united states 
leapfrog schoolhouse product areas currently include assessment  early literacy  early childhood  reading  language arts  math  english language development  and special education 
our schoolhouse products are research based products that are tied to state standards  and have been adopted or listed in cities  states and regions  including california  illinois  new york city and texas 
through 
table of contents our schoolhouse division  we currently offer exclusively for the school market  more than leappad and quantum pad books  as well as over interactive skill cards  which represent over  pages of interactive content 
our leaptrack assessment and instruction system is designed to meet the increasing demands for accountability in schools 
the leaptrack system provides teachers with the ability to instantly assess their students  personalize student instruction and continuously monitor student progress relative to state standards 
our literacy center program has been adopted and listed as a supplemental early reading curriculum by seven states and one major metropolitan city 
our comprehensive  research based pre kindergarten curriculum  the ready  set  leap program  meets head start standards and was adopted by the texas state board of education 
we have also developed and introduced our nine theme  interactive book english language development program  language first  which is designed to build oral language skills for students for whom english is a second language 
in addition to these core programs  our schoolhouse division offers a library of interactive books to be used with our leappad and quantum pad learning platforms  and which are designed to address challenging issues in classroom instruction we have grown significantly and consistently by introducing innovative new platforms and other products  expanding our content offerings and increasing our distribution 
from to  our total net sales increased from million to million and our total net income increased from million to million 
the educational foundation of our products we believe that sound educational principles are at the core of the value of our brands and products 
all leapfrog content and curriculum is based on a proprietary method of learning  created by our in house educational experts with the assistance of our education advisory board  that identifies what children learn and when and how they learn it 
our grade based content is aligned with state and national education standards  often mirroring what is learned in the classroom 
the following four educational principles are at the core of our products children learn best when actively engaged our products encourage active participation by asking children questions and requiring them to direct their own play before continuing with an activity 
for example  children using our leappad interactive books can control the information they receive by deciding what to touch with the neartouch stylus 
even our learning drum  designed for infants  engages them by only continuing with the activity or game after receiving a response from the child 
positive reinforcement and immediate feedback encourage continued effort our educational products are designed to help develop self confidence through immediate and supportive feedback 
many of our products offer clues that are designed to help lead a child to the correct answer  while at the same time providing information on incorrect responses 
for example  if a child is asked to locate spain on our explorer interactive globe and touches france  the globe will respond  you found france and then provide a clue as to how the child can locate spain 
we believe this combination of presenting new information and offering positive reinforcement encourages the child to continue learning 
ability appropriate tasks motivate learners we believe that learning is most effective when a task matches the learner s ability 
for instance  a task that is too easy may quickly become boring while a task that is too difficult may be discouraging and demoralizing 
to address this issue  we offer a variety of age appropriate platforms and a library of content for each of these platforms to address the specific needs of children as their skills develop and interests mature 
through our learning center shelf displays and our leapfrog newsletter  we provide guidance to parents on how to select the appropriate product and content for each child s age and ability 
we have also developed products that adapt to the user s abilities 
for example  we have designed our turbo twist handhelds to deliver easier or more difficult questions based on a child s performance 
we believe this technology enables the child to spend more time within his or her optimal learning zone 
supplemental materials should complement and enhance what children learn at school we design our products and content to be consistent with the curricula used in schools across the us for example  we offer a library of content cartridges compatible with our iquest handheld of test questions corresponding to over major textbooks currently used in us middle schools 
with the guidance of the educational experts in our schoolhouse division  we also design our products in accordance with state and federal standards regarding the scope and sequence of learning 
we believe these educational principles are fundamental building blocks on which our company is built 
we implement these principles by leveraging our team of in house educational experts and our outside education advisory board  which consists of distinguished educators 
the members of our education advisory board actively participate in the design and development of our products by meeting with our creative design team several times each year 
our education advisory board also is an external source of feedback for our creative design team with respect to new products that are in the development stage 
we believe that both our in house experts and outside advisors are critical in the creation of our learning products

finally  we sell our english language content internationally through consumer retail and educational channels and believe that significant opportunities exist to market our products as tools to learn english as a foreign language 
advertising and marketing our advertising and marketing strategy is designed to establish leapfrog as the leading provider of engaging  effective and affordable learning solutions for the infant through high school audience and as a brand that parents and educators will seek to supplement a child s educational needs

in key retail stores  we feature our products via our learning center shelf displays  which are designed to highlight our leapfrog brand as the one stop solution for technology based educational products 
we have received additional brand exposure through television appearances by senior management and other television spots showcasing our products  often during the key holiday season 
sales and distribution us consumer we market and sell our products primarily through national and regional mass market retail stores as well as specialty toy stores 
in  sales of our products to toys r us  wal mart including sam s club and target accounted for over of net sales in our us consumer segment 
our remaining us consumer retail sales came from sales of our products to specialty toy stores and  to a lesser extent  to book  electronics and office supply stores and other retailers 
our sales team works in conjunction with store buyers from our key retailers to forecast demand for our products  develop the store floor footprint  secure retail shelf space for our products and agree upon pricing components  including cooperative advertising allowances 
the large retail chains generally provide us with a preliminary forecast of their expected purchases of our products early in the year 
while these and subsequent forecasts are not contractually binding  they provide important feedback that we use in our planning process throughout the year 
we work closely with our key retailers during the year to establish and revise our expected demand forecasts and plan our production and delivery needs accordingly 
most retailers issue purchase orders to us  as they need product 
based on these purchase orders  we prepare shipments for delivery through various methods 
we sell to smaller retail stores through a combination of sales representatives and direct salespeople 

table of contents education and training our education and training group s primary customers represent us pre kindergarten through th grade classrooms as well as teacher supply stores and catalogs through our schoolhouse division

international in  we established our uk office  located outside london  england  which sells our products directly to woolworth s  early learning centres  toys r us  argos and other leading uk retailers 
our emerging success in penetrating the uk market is exemplified by the british association of toy retailers choosing our leappad platform as the top preschool toy for each of  and our uk office also coordinates distribution of our uk localized british english products into australia and new zealand 
we also have satellite offices in hong kong and macau that help us oversee global manufacturing of our products 
in  we began selling directly to retailers in canada and in france and in we began selling directly to retailers in mexico 
prior to the establishment of overseas offices or subsidiaries  we utilize simple distribution arrangements to sell our products in other non english speaking countries  using separate distributors for the consumer and school markets as appropriate 
in markets where we do not establish direct sales  we plan on continuing to use these distribution arrangements 
paralleling our segmentation of the us market between consumer and school markets  we believe that overseas markets represent similar dual opportunities 
although we plan to develop most key consumer markets directly  we expect to seek a strategic education partner in key overseas markets given the costs and challenges associated with developing country by country curricula 
we currently have distribution arrangements with distributors in countries such as spain  korea  australia and new zealand 
in march  sega toys began distributing the cocopad system  a co branded  modified version of our leappad platform  and sega toys has developed original japanese language content for interactive books used with the cocopad system  including books by berlitz international that help teach english

in addition  we offer licensed brainquest content for our turbo twist handheld and test preparation materials from kaplan  inc for use with our iquest handheld 
we launched our developer s studio in july  a team dedicated to creating software tools that help turn the content designed by our content developers into interactive content that work with our various platforms 
the tools developed by this team have shortened the time to market for our new interactive books 
in an effort to increase the amount and variety of content available for our platform products  we make these tools available to outside developers 
our developer s studio team trains and provides technical support to internal and external content development teams  and works with our production team to turn our internally developed content into interactive books 
finally  this team is responsible for managing the business relationships with our growing community of third party developers that are trained to create content for our platforms 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in intellectual property we believe that the protection of our patents  trademarks  trade dress  copyrights and trade secrets is critical to our future success  and we aggressively protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual agreements 
as of december   we had over utility and design patents issued by the us patent and trademark office  as well as over issued internationally 
these include domestic and foreign patents related to our leappad platform technology  which do not expire before additionally  we have filed over patent applications pending in the united states and other countries 
we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents  or that  if issued  any of these patents  or our patents that have already issued  will offer protection against competitors with similar technology 
as of december   we also had over us trademark registrations  including for marks incorporating leapfrog and the leappad and neartouch marks  as well as over foreign trademark registrations 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position

manufacturing  logistics and other operations our manufacturing and operations strategy is designed to maximize the use of outsourced services particularly with respect to the actual production and physical distribution of our products and to concentrate our internal resources on areas such as engineering  production planning and quality control 
we believe our outsourcing strategy also enhances the scalability of our manufacturing efforts 
in order to work closely with our manufacturing service providers  we have established offices in hong kong and macau 
we use several turnkey contract manufacturers to source components and build finished products to our specifications 
we order our products on a purchase order basis from component suppliers and some of the components used to make our products  including our asics  currently come from a single supplier 
for information as to how this concentration of suppliers could affect our business  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect our results and stock price we do not have long term agreements with our major suppliers  and they may stop manufacturing our components at any time  and we depend on our suppliers for our components  and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available 
we currently use eight contract manufacturers located in mainland china to build our finished products  which are selected based on their technical and production capabilities and are matched to particular products to achieve cost and quality efficiencies 
we have our own quality assurance employees on site at each of our contract manufacturers 
during the years from to  jetta company limited  one of our manufacturers in china  supplied  and of our products  respectively  and our top three manufacturers combined supplied a total of  and of our products  respectively 
for information as to how this concentration of manufacturing could affect our business  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect our results and stock price we rely on a limited number of manufacturers  virtually all of which are located in china  to produce our finished products  and our reputation and operating results could be harmed if they fail to produce quality products in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities 
the majority of our products are shipped directly to our contract warehouse in ontario  california and are later shipped to meet the demands of our major us retailers and other smaller retailers and distributors throughout the united states 
information technology our information technology environment is built around an oracle system that supports our core order management  distribution  manufacturing and financial operations worldwide 
we are also in the process of implementing new applications that are intended to further improve our supply chain management capabilities 
these applications include supply chain planning software and warehouse management systems for our new distribution facility that is anticipated to be operational in mid in addition  we also have software systems that we use for both sales analytics and financial planning 
customer service we believe that our ability to establish and maintain long term relationships with consumers and retailers depends  in part  on the strength of our customer support and service operations 
we encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our customers and retailers to continually improve our products and service 
our consumer service center operates hours a day  days a week during peak periods  specifically from november through january  and hours on weekdays  and hours on saturdays during off peak periods 
we offer toll free telephone support for consumers and retailers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative 
we also respond to email inquiries received through our website  and we have a team of in house customer service representatives who oversee and coordinate our customer service activities with our third party customer service provider 
in addition  on our website  we have a knowledge resource link that directs consumers to a frequently asked questions section  which we update as we receive consumer feedback 
we also have a dedicated retail sales service team 
this team works with our top retailers and provides point of sale related analysis for better forecasting and inventory plans 
our service operations are based in our emeryville  california facility 
competition we compete primarily in the infant and toddler category  preschool category and the electronic learning aids category of the us toy industry and  to some degree  in the overall us and international toy industries 
we believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products in retail stores are brand  design  features  educational soundness  quality and price 
we believe that we compare favorably with many of our current competitors with respect to some or all of 
table of contents these factors 
our current principal competitors in the toy industry compete in the preschool category and include hasbro  inc  mattel  inc 
and vtech corporation 
in  mattel introduced a product under the name powertouch under mattel s fisher price brand  and publications international  ltd 
introduced a product under the name activepad  each having functionality similar to that of some of the platforms in our leappad family of platforms 
in june  toshiba corporation began selling an interactive educational platform product in japan under the name ex pad 
we also compete with educational software publishers  such as knowledge adventure a studio of vivendi universal games  whose products have distribution at mass retailers and electronics and toy stores  and with producers of popular handheld game platforms  such as nintendo co  ltd 
and sony corporation  whose products may compete with our leapster platform 
we believe that producers of smart mobile devices  such as personal digital assistants  non mobile game platforms and computer based software may be able to compete effectively in our primary markets by developing engaging educational products that run on their platforms 
these companies have significantly larger installed bases than we do 
we are also beginning to cross over into their markets with products such as our iquest handheld device 
in addition  a number of major hardware and software makers have developed pen based portable computers like the tablet pc that could compete with some of our products  such as our leappad family of platforms 
consequently  competitors may include companies like acer inc  apple computer  inc  fujitsu limited  hewlett packard company  microsoft corporation  nec corporation  palmone  inc  palmsource  inc  sega corporation  and toshiba 
many of our direct  indirect and potential competitors have significantly longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our schoolhouse division competes in the us supplemental educational materials market 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products in the school market are educational soundness  proven effectiveness  brand  features and price 
our schoolhouse division faces competition in the supplemental curriculum market from major textbook publishers such as harcourt a division of reed elsevier  houghton mifflin company  mcgraw hill  pearson plc and scholastic corporation  as well as electronic educational material and service providers such as knowledge adventure  plato learning  inc  renaissance learning and riverdeep group plc 
many of the companies with whom we compete have significantly more experience in the supplemental educational materials market and greater resources than we do 
in the future  large entertainment companies such as viacom international  inc and walt disney co 
may begin to target the school markets 
for a discussion of the possible effects that competition could have on our business  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect our results and stock price if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  our net sales and market share could decline 
seasonality our business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
for more information  see seasonality and quarterly results of operations and risk factors that may affect our results and stock price our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results will depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season in item of this form k 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we intend to hire additional employees as needed at each of our facilities 
we also retain independent contractors to provide various services  primarily in connection with our software development and sales activities 
we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

 in january  we served fisher price with the complaint 
we are seeking damages and injunctive relief 
learning resources  inc v 
leapfrog enterprises  inc 
in november  learning resources filed a complaint against us in federal district court in illinois alleging that our trademark pretend learn infringes on its trademark pretend play 
learning resources seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to learning resources claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
stockholder class action and derivative lawsuits on december   a class action complaint entitled miller v 
leapfrog enterprises  inc  et al  no 
rmw  was filed in federal district court for the northern district of california against leapfrog and certain of its current and former officers and directors alleging violations of the securities exchange act of  or act

leapfrog enterprises  inc  et al  no 
mjj  abrams v 
leapfrog enterprises inc  et al  no 
mjj  and ornelas v 
leapfrog enterprises  inc  et al  no 
sba 
each of those complaints purports to be a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of persons who acquired our class a common stock during the period of july  through october  on february   the plaintiff in the weil action amended her complaint and now seeks to maintain a class action on behalf of persons who acquired our class a common stock during the period of july  through february  all of the complaints allege that the defendants caused us to make false and misleading statements about our business and forecasts about our financial performance  and that certain of our individual officers and directors sold portions of their stock holdings while in the possession of adverse  non public information 
the weil complaint also alleges that our financial statements were false and misleading 
the complaints do not specify the amount of damages sought 
we anticipate that all of these actions will ultimately be consolidated into one action and that a consolidated amended complaint will be filed after the appointment of a lead plaintiff 
the us district court has scheduled a hearing on the appointment of a lead plaintiff and consolidation on march  we have not yet responded to any of the complaints  discovery has not commenced  and no trial date has been established

on december   a stockholder derivative complaint entitled santos v 
michael wood  et al  no

the complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets  unjust enrichment and violations of the california corporations code  based upon allegations that certain of our officers and directors participated in the conduct alleged in the securities class action complaints and participated in alleged improper stock sales 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages against the individual defendants on behalf of leapfrog  equitable relief and attorneys fees 
on february   we filed a motion to dismiss this derivative complaint 
the basis of our motion is that we believe the plaintiff does not have standing to bring this lawsuit since the plaintiff has never served a demand on our board of directors that 
table of contents the board take certain actions on behalf of leapfrog 
the individual officer and director defendants have also filed a similar motion to dismiss this stockholder derivative complaint 
the hearing on these motions is expected to take place in april discovery has not commenced and no trial date has been established

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we design  develop and market technology based educational platforms  related interactive content and stand alone products for sale to retailers  distributors and schools 
since the founding of our business in  we have grown from a start up business selling stand alone educational toys into a company selling multiple platform products and related interactive content  as well as stand alone products  with total net sales in of million 
we operate three business segments  which we refer to as us consumer  education and training  and international 
to date  we have sold our products predominantly through the toy sections of major retailers 
for further information regarding our three business segments  see note segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our vision for leapfrog is to become the leading brand for technology based educational products for home and school use for all ages around the world 
we believe that leapfrog is in the early stage of this vision 
to date  we have established our brand and products largely focused on children in the preschool through third grade levels primarily in the us retail market 
we believe that leapfrog is  first and foremost  an educational products company  and we use the toy form factor to make learning fun and engaging 
as a result  our sales in our us consumer segment  our largest business segment  currently are generated in the toy aisles of retailers across the united states 
the market for toy retailers has seen  and continues to see consolidation 
in addition to the traditional channel of specialty toy retailers  of which toys r us has become the major player  the mass market retail channel has grown in importance 
for example  wal mart  target and a number of regional mass market retailers have seen growth in their market shares within the us toy retail market 
the mass market retailers have certain competitive advantages in the highly seasonal toy market because they have the ability to dedicate a significant amount of shelf space to toys during the fall holiday season  and then reduce the allocated shelf space for toys during the rest of the year 
the net sales in our us consumer segment have increased in both amount and percentage with these mass market retailers  and as a result of the seasonal changes of retail space allocation to toys  including our products  by these retailers  the seasonal effects of the toy retail market are exacerbated 
we anticipate that the toy industry s dependence on mass market retailers will continue to grow 
in the us consumer segment  we market and sell our products directly to national and regional mass market and specialty retailers as well as to other retail stores through sales representatives 
our us consumer segment is our most developed business  and is subject to significant seasonal influences  with the substantial majority of our sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
in  this segment represented approximately of our total net sales 
although we are expanding our retail presence by selling our products to bookstores and electronics and office supply stores  the significant majority of our us consumer sales are to a few large retailers 
sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately of our total net sales in compared to in and in at december   wal mart  toys r us and target accounted for  and  respectively  of our accounts receivable 
consistent with industry practice  we rely on short term purchase orders for the sale of our products to us retailers 
in  we successfully launched three new platforms leappad plus writing  littletouch leappad and leapster 
combined  these new platforms accounted for approximately of our us consumer segment s net sales in although we believe net sales for this business segment will grow in the future  we anticipate that this segment s percentage of total company net sales will decrease  as we expect our other two segments to grow at a faster rate than our us consumer segment 
our education and training segment targets the school market in the united states  including sales directly to educational institutions  to teacher supply stores and through catalogs aimed at educators 
the education and training segment represented approximately of our total net sales in net sales in our education and training segment increased by from to  and the segment reduced its operating loss from million in to an operating loss of million in in our international segment  we sell our products outside the united states directly to overseas retailers and through various distribution and strategic arrangements 
we have four direct sales offices in the united kingdom  canada  france and mexico  and maintain various distribution and strategic arrangements in countries such as australia  japan and korea among others 
the international segment represented approximately of our total net sales in net sales in our international segment increased from to and operating income grew from million in to million in we believe this segment is in the early stage of its development and will continue its expansion to represent a larger percentage of our total net sales in coming years 
gross profit margins in decreased by basis points  from in to in this decrease was primarily due to lower profit margins in our us consumer segment  offset by higher profit margins in our education and training and our international segments 
the decrease in gross profit margins in our us consumer segment was the result of lower margin leapster platform sales  as well as higher freight and warehousing expenses 
we expect that our gross profit margins in the us consumer segment will remain relatively flat for 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  legal  marketing expenses  systems costs  rent and office equipment and supplies 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with content development  product development and product engineering 
our advertising expenses consist primarily of television advertising  cooperative advertising and in store displays 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and capitalized website development and amortization of intangibles  however it excludes depreciation of manufacturing tools and capitalized content development  which are classified in cost of sales 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and reported disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventories and related allowances  intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  some of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon shipment  either from our us distribution facility or directly from our third party manufacturers 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns and allowances for defective products 
a small portion of our revenue is deferred and recognized as revenue over a period of twelve to eighteen months  which is the estimated period of use of the products 
we deferred approximately  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
allowances for accounts receivable we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history and aging of the receivable 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide estimated allowances for product returns  charge backs and defectives on product sales in the same period that we record the related revenue 
we estimate our allowances by utilizing historical information for existing products 
for new products  we estimate our allowances for product returns on specific terms for product returns and our experience with similar products 
in estimating returns  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii analysis of credit memo data  iii current inventory on hand at customers  iv changes in demand and v introduction of new products 
we continually assess the historical rates experience and adjust our allowances as appropriate  and consider other known factors 
if actual product returns  charge backs and defective products are greater than our estimates  additional allowances may be required 
historically  our estimated reserves for accounts receivables  returns  charge backs and defectives have been adequate to cover actual charges 
inventories and related allowance for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market value and are reduced by an allowance for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories 
our estimate for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on our management s review of on hand inventories compared to their estimated future usage and demand for our products 
if actual future usage and demand for our products are less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets intangible assets  including excess purchase price over the cost of net assets acquired  arose from our september  acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of our predecessor  leapfrog rbt  and our acquisition of substantially all the assets of explore technologies on july  at december   our intangible assets had a net 
table of contents balance of million 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for goodwill and some other intangible assets 
we adopted the pronouncement effective january   and accordingly we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
as of december   we had million  net  of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  which are no longer subject to amortization 
at december   we tested our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment based on the fair value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future  known as the income approach 
based on this assessment we determined that no adjustments were necessary to the stated values 
the determination of related useful lives and whether the intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require that adjustments be recorded to asset balances 
we review intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
content development  home video production and tooling capitalization our management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
we capitalize the prepublication costs of books as content development costs 
only costs incurred with outside parties are capitalized 
in  we capitalized million of content development costs  million of which pertained to our education and training segment 
in  we capitalized million in content development costs  million of which pertained to our education and training segment 
we depreciate these assets from the time of publication over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be three years  using the sum of years digits method 
if the related content is deemed to have a shorter useful life  the remaining balance is written off when the content is no longer used in production 
in  we changed the reporting classification for the amortization of content development costs 
previously  such costs were classified as depreciation and amortization in the operating expenses section 
amortization of content development costs are now being classified as cost of sales 
all prior periods reported have been reclassified in this form k to conform to this presentation 
we capitalize costs related to the production of home video in accordance with aicpa statement of accounting position no 
 accounting by producers or distributors of film 
video production costs are amortized based on the ratio of the current period s gross revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues from all sources on an individual production basis 
in the year ended december   we capitalized million and amortized million of video production costs 
we had no video production cost in prior years 
if the related video production costs are deemed to have lower gross revenues than originally expected  the remaining balance is written off when the revised revenues are earned 
we capitalize costs related to manufacturing tools developed for our products 
we capitalized million in compared with million in related to manufacturing tools 
we depreciate these assets on a straight line basis  in cost of sales  over an estimated useful life of two years 
if the related product line or our manufacturing production results in a shorter life than originally expected  we write off the remaining balance when we remove the tool from production 
stock based compensation we account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  whereby compensation is generally not recorded for options granted at fair value to employees and directors 
in connection with stock options granted to employees in august  we recorded an aggregate of million of deferred compensation in stockholders equity for the year ended december  these options were considered compensatory because the deemed fair value of the underlying shares of class a common stock in august  as subsequently determined  was greater than the exercise price of the options 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 this deferred compensation will be amortized to expense through the third quarter of as the options vest 
stock based compensation arrangements to nonemployees are accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to others than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned

bender  our president  worldwide consumer group  entered into new employment agreements providing for  among other things  acceleration of vesting and extension of the exercise period of their stock options upon the termination of their employment by leapfrog without cause or by the employee for good reason as defined in the agreements or a change in control of leapfrog during the term of the applicable agreement 
under applicable accounting principles  upon any termination of employment or change in control resulting in such acceleration or extension  we would be required to recognize compensation expense 
the amount of any such compensation expense would depend on the number of option shares affected by the acceleration or extension and could be material to our financial results 
prior to our july initial public offering  we granted stock appreciation rights under our amended and restated employee equity participation plan that are measured at each period end against the fair value of the class a common stock at that time 
the resulting difference between periods is recognized as expense at each period end measurement date based on the vesting of the rights 
in february  we converted  stock appreciation rights into options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock 
deferred compensation of approximately million related to the unvested portion will be amortized to expense through the third quarter of as the options vest 
in july  we converted  stock appreciation rights into options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock 
the expense related to the conversion of the vested stock appreciation rights was million through july based on vested rights with respect to  shares of class a common stock outstanding as of july  at our initial public offering price of per share 
our deferred compensation expense in connection with the conversion of  unvested stock appreciation rights held by employees converted to options to purchase  shares of class a common stock  was million 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  beginning in the third quarter of and for the following quarters  we will recognize this expense over the remaining vesting period of the options into which the unvested rights are converted 
deferred compensation related to the unvested portion will be amortized to expense as the options vest 
to the extent any of the unvested options are forfeited  our actual expense recognized could be lower than currently anticipated 
concurrently with our initial public offering  we stopped granting stock appreciation rights under the employee equity participation plan

in addition  our other two new platforms  leappad plus writing and littletouch leappad  have lower margins than our existing mature platforms 
historically  as our platforms mature  gross margins have benefited from engineering improvements and higher sales volumes 
higher warehousing fees were incurred due to increased sales volume and average inventory levels compared to last year

in addition  our accounts receivable balance typically peaks in the third and fourth quarters  and most of these accounts receivable are not due for payment until the fourth quarter or the subsequent year 
as a result  cash flow from operating activities is strongest in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
quarterly cash flow from operating activities were as follows cash flow from operating activities st qtr nd qtr rd qtr th qtr total in millions 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in net cash used in operating activities was million in the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily due the following factors our inventory balances increased at a lower rate from to  an increase of million  compared to million from to our inventory balances were adequate in supporting our sales growth in  as reflected by the year over year sales growth in all our segments 
we believe that our inventory is at an adequate level to support our continued growth in the first half of 
table of contents the million  or  growth in net income also contributed to the improvement of net cash provided by operating activities 
net income increased primarily due to increased sales and operating expense leverage achieved in compared to increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million due to the increase in option exercises in the higher receivable balances negatively impacted our cash flows from operations by million from to our days sales outstanding  or dso  increased from days at december  to days at december  the dso increase was primarily due to the timing of shipments  as a higher percentage of sales in were shipped later in the fourth quarter  pushing collection into early as of february   our account receivables balance  net of allowances  was approximately million 
we anticipate the collection of these receivables will positively impact our cash flow from operations in the first quarter of our year end allowances related to accounts receivable were million at december   million at december  and million at december   primarily due to lower average selling prices resulting from discounts on our more matured platforms 
the net cash used in operating activities in of million consisted primarily of the net income in of million  and increases in the provision for allowances for accounts receivable of million and income taxes payable of million  offset by the increase in accounts receivable of million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the primary component of net cash used in investing activities for was net purchases of short term investments of million and million in purchases of property and equipment 
the primary components of the net cash used in investing activities for and were purchases of property and equipment of million in and million in  used in the ordinary course of our business 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the primary component of cash from financing activities in was proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in and for part of  we relied on our long term secured credit facility with foothill capital corporation and proceeds received from the issuance of series a preferred stock to fund our operations 
we repaid the entire amount of our outstanding long term loan with foothill from the proceeds from our initial public offering in the series a preferred stock was converted to class a common stock in november we estimate that our capital expenditures for will be between million and million  as compared to million in  million in and million in the increase in our estimate over is primarily related to increased computers and software expenses  resulting from our continued growth  and increased manufacturing tool purchases for use in the production of our existing and new products 
we believe our current cash and short term investments and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements through contractual obligations we conduct our corporate operations from leased facilities and lease some equipment under operating leases 
generally  these have initial lease periods of three to ten years and contain provisions for renewal options of five years at market rates

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  or fin r 
fin r provides a broad deferral of the latest date by which all public entities must apply fin to certain variable interest entities to the first reporting period ending after march  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or rights to use assets 
under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
eitf was effective for revenue arrangements entered into after june  the application of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows for the year ended december  risk factors that may affect our results and stock price our business and our stock price are subject to many risks and uncertainties that may affect our future financial performance 
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our operating results to vary or that may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows if we fail to predict consumer preferences and trends accurately  develop and introduce new products rapidly or enhance and extend our existing core products  our sales will suffer 
sales of our platforms  related software and stand alone products typically have grown in the periods following initial introduction  but we expect sales of specific products to decrease as they mature 
the introduction of new products and the enhancement and extension of existing products  through the introduction of additional software or by other means  are critical to our future sales growth 
the successful development of new products and the enhancement and extension of our current products will require us to anticipate the needs and preferences of consumers and educators and to forecast market and technological trends accurately 
consumer preferences  and particularly children s preferences  are continuously changing and are difficult to predict 
in addition  educational curricula change as states adopt new standards 
the development of new interactive learning products requires high levels of innovation and this process can be lengthy and costly 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop enhancements of our neartouch and other technologies successfully 
in  we intend to introduce a number of new platforms  stand alone products and interactive books and other software for each of our three business segments 
we cannot assure you that these or other future products will be introduced or  if introduced  will be successful 
the failure to enhance and extend our existing products or to develop and introduce new products that achieve and sustain market acceptance and produce acceptable margins would harm our business and operating results 

table of contents our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season 
sales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal  causing the substantial majority of our sales to us retailers to occur during the third and fourth quarters 
in  approximately of our total net sales occurred during this period 
this percentage of total sales may increase as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through just in time inventory management systems 
generally  retailers time their orders so that suppliers like us will fill the orders closer to the time of purchase by consumers  thereby reducing their need to maintain larger on hand inventories throughout the year to meet demand 
while these techniques reduce retailers investments in their inventory  they increase pressure on suppliers to fill orders promptly and shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to suppliers like us 
the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods will increase the risk that we fail to meet tight shipping schedules  which could damage our relationships with retailers  increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost 
for example  in the second half of  one of our largest retail customers changed its order pattern to occur later in the holiday season  which we believe delayed a significant portion of our net sales to this customer from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of the seasonal pattern of sales in the retail channel requires significant use of our working capital to manufacture and carry inventory in anticipation of the holiday season  as well as early and accurate forecasting of holiday sales 
failure to predict accurately and respond appropriately to consumer demand on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations  or any disruption of consumer buying habits during this key period  would harm our business and operating results 
we rely on a limited number of manufacturers  virtually all of which are located in china  to produce our finished products  and our reputation and operating results could be harmed if they fail to produce quality products in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities 
we outsource substantially all of our finished goods manufacturing to eight manufacturers  all of whom manufacture our products at facilities in the guangdong province in the southeastern region of china 
one of these manufacturers  jetta company limited  was the sole manufacturer of all our leappad platforms in we depend on these manufacturers to produce sufficient volumes of our products in a timely fashion and at satisfactory quality levels 
we generally allow retailers and distributors to return or receive credit for defective or damaged products 
if our manufacturers fail to produce quality products on time and in sufficient quantities due to capital shortages  late payments from us  political instability  labor shortages  intellectual property disputes  natural disasters  energy shortages  terrorism or other disruptions to their businesses  our reputation and operating results would suffer 
in addition  if our manufacturers decide to increase production for their other customers  they may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products and our business could be harmed 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  our sales and market share could decline 
we currently compete primarily in the infant and toddler and preschool categories and electronic learning aids category of the us toy industry and  to some degree  in the overall us and international toy industry 
our schoolhouse division competes in the supplemental educational materials market 
each of these markets is very competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
for example  in july  mattel  inc introduced under its fisher price brand a product called powertouch having functionality similar to that of our leappad platform 
we believe that we are beginning to compete  and will increasingly compete in the future  with makers of popular game platforms and smart mobile devices such as personal digital assistants 
these companies are well situated to compete effectively in our primary markets 
additionally  we are beginning to cross over into their markets with products such as our leapster platform and iquest handheld device 
many of our direct  indirect and potential competitors have significantly longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to changes in consumer requirements or preferences or to new or emerging technologies 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively in our markets 
our quarterly operating results are susceptible to fluctuations that could cause our stock price to decline 
historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly 
for example  our net income loss for the first through fourth quarters of was million  million  million and million  respectively 
our net income loss for the first through fourth quarters of was million  million  million and million  respectively 
we expect these fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons  including seasonal influences on our sales  such as the holiday shopping season and back to school purchasing  unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  
table of contents timing of new product introductions  general economic conditions  the results of legal proceedings  changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in consumer electronics and toy markets  international sales volume and the mix of such sales among countries with similar or different holidays and school years than the united states  the impact of strategic relationships  the sales cycle to schools  which may be uneven depending on budget constraints  the timing of purchases and other seasonal influences  and the timing of orders by our customers and our ability to fulfill those orders in a timely manner  or at all 
for example  fao  inc filed for bankruptcy protection in december and kb toys  inc filed for bankruptcy in january these and other retailers may elect to close a significant number of stores in  and such actions would affect the timing and amounts of orders of our products from these retailers 
in turn  the effects of any changes in orders from these retailers could have a material effect on our quarterly operating results  particularly in the first two quarters of the year  when our sales are generally much lower than in the second half of the year 
we expect that we will continue to incur losses during the first and second quarters of each year for the foreseeable future 
we do not have sufficient operating experience to predict the overall effect of various seasonal factors and their effect on our future quarterly operating results 
if we fail to meet our projected net sales or other projected operating results  or if we fail to meet analysts or investors expectations  the market price of our class a common stock could decrease 
we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  on our leappad family of platforms and related interactive books for a significant portion of our sales 
our leappad  leappad plus writing and quantum pad platforms  each of which is based on our neartouch technology  together with interactive books related to those platforms that are generally compatible with any of those platforms  accounted for an aggregate of approximately of our net sales in our my first leappad platform and my first leappad interactive books accounted for an aggregate of approximately of our net sales in no other product line  together with any related software  accounted for more than approximately of our net sales in a significant portion of our future sales will depend on the continued commercial success of our leappad  leappad plus writing  quantum pad platforms and compatible interactive books  and our my first leappad platforms and related interactive books 
if the sales for our leappad  leappad plus writing  quantum pad and my first leappad platforms are below expected sales or if sales of their related interactive books do not grow as we anticipate  sales of our other products may not be able to compensate for these shortfalls and our overall sales would suffer 
our business depends on three retailers that together accounted for approximately of our net sales in  and our dependence upon a small group of retailers may increase 
wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted in the aggregate for approximately of our net sales in we expect that a small number of large retailers will continue to account for a significant majority of our sales and that our sales to these retailers may increase as a percentage of our total sales 
at december   wal mart including sam s club accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable and toys r us accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable 
if any of these retailers experience significant financial difficulty in the future or otherwise fail to satisfy their accounts payable  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable could be insufficient 
if any of these retailers reduce their purchases from us  change the terms on which we conduct business with them or experience a future downturn in their business  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we do not have long term agreements with our retailers and changes in our relationships with retailers could significantly harm our business and operating results 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our retailers 
as a result  agreements with respect to pricing  shelf space  cooperative advertising or special promotions  among other things  are subject to periodic negotiation with each retailer 
retailers make no binding long term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering one time purchase orders 
if the number of our products increases as we have planned or the roll out of versions of our learning center shelf displays in selected retail stores proceeds as we anticipate  we will require more retail shelf space to display our various products 
any retailer could reduce its overall purchases of our products  reduce the number and variety of our products 
table of contents that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products  decide not to incorporate versions of our learning center shelf displays in its stores or otherwise materially change the terms of our current relationship at any time 
any such change could significantly harm our business and operating results 
our future growth will depend in part on our schoolhouse division  which may not be successful 
we launched our schoolhouse division in june  and to date the division  which accounts for substantially all of the results of our education and training segment  has incurred cumulative losses 
although the division reported an operating profit for the second quarter of  it incurred operating losses in the third and fourth quarters of and we anticipate that it may incur additional operating losses in the near term 
sales from our schoolhouse division s curriculum based products will depend principally on broadening market acceptance of those products  which in turn depends on a number of factors  including our ability to demonstrate to teachers and other key educational institution decision makers the usefulness of our products to supplement traditional teaching practices  the willingness of teachers  administrators  parents and students to use products in a classroom setting from a company that may be perceived as a toy manufacturer  the effectiveness of our sales force  particularly since we rely on independent sales representatives  the availability of state and federal government funding  which may be severely limited due to budget shortfalls currently faced by many states and the federal government  to defray  subsidize or pay for the costs of our products  and our ability to demonstrate that our products improve academic performance 
if we cannot increase market acceptance of our schoolhouse division s supplemental educational products  including our leaptrack assessment system introduced in fall  the division may not be able to achieve operating profits on a full year basis and our future sales could suffer 
as of december   we had capitalized million of our content development costs relating to our schoolhouse division 
in we capitalized an additional million 
in  we capitalized approximately million 
if the schoolhouse division does not achieve operating profits  we may have to write off some or all of these capitalized costs  which could significantly harm our operating results 
our planned expansion into additional international markets may not succeed and our future operating results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
we have limited experience with sales operations outside the united states 
in  we expanded beyond the use of international distributors to sell our products and started selling our products directly to retailers in the united kingdom 
we began selling directly to retailers in canada in june  to retailers in france in july  and to retailers in mexico in september  and we plan to enter the german speaking markets in europe through our distributor  stadlbauer marketing vertrieb gmbh  in the second half of we derived approximately of our net sales from outside the united states in and in we intend to increase our international sales through additional overseas offices to develop further our direct sales efforts  distributor relationships and strategic relationships with companies with operations outside of the united states  such as benesse corporation and sega toys in japan 
however  these and other efforts may not help increase sales of our products outside the united states 
our business is  and will increasingly be  subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally  including political and economic instability  military conflicts and civil unrest  existing and future governmental policies  greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  complications in modifying our products for local markets or in complying with foreign laws  including consumer protection laws and local language laws  transportation delays and interruptions  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights  
table of contents trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices and problems in collecting accounts receivable  and limitations  including taxes  on the repatriation of earnings 
any difficulty with our international operations could harm our future sales and operating results 
third parties have claimed  and may claim in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to incur significant litigation or licensing expenses or to stop selling some or all of our products or using some of our trademarks 
in the course of our business  we periodically receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
upon receipt of this type of communication  we evaluate the validity and applicability of allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights to determine whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies or trademarks or other proprietary matters in or on our products 
any dispute or litigation regarding patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights  regardless of its outcome  may be costly and time consuming  and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
if we  our distributors or our manufacturers are adjudged to be infringing the intellectual property rights of any third party  we or they may be required to obtain a license to use those rights  which may not be obtainable on reasonable terms  if at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of some or all of our products or against the use of a trademark in the sale of some or all of our products 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all the liability that could be imposed 
we may presently be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology or products 
we will continue to be subject to infringement claims as we increase the number and type of products we offer  as the number of products  services and competitors in our markets grow  as we enter new markets and as our products receive more attention and publicity 
for additional discussion of litigation related to the protection of our intellectual property  see item legal proceedings 
learning resources  inc v 
leapfrog enterprises  inc 
if we fail to be successful against these claims  it could require us to stop selling our leappad and other platforms and to pay damages 
our intellectual property rights may not prevent our competitors from using our technologies or similar technologies to develop competing products  which could weaken our competitive position and harm our operating results 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technologies that are used in our learning platforms and related software  such as my first leappad  leappad  leappad plus writing  quantum pad and leapster platforms  as well as our explorer and odyssey interactive globe series 
we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
the contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
for example  we are aware that products very similar to some of ours have been produced by others in china  and we are vigorously seeking to enforce our rights 
however  we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights  if any  in china or other countries where such product may be manufactured or sold 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is costly  and any dispute or other litigation  regardless of outcome  may be costly and time consuming and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where we do not hold patents or trademarks or where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the united states 
some of our products and product features have limited intellectual property protection  and  as a consequence  we may not have the legal right to prevent others from reverse engineering or otherwise copying and using these features in competitive products 
for additional discussion of litigation related to the protection of our intellectual property  see item legal proceedings 
leapfrog enterprises  inc v 
fisher price  inc if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our rights could be diminished and our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
outbreaks of health epidemics  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  and the so called asian bird flu may adversely impact our business or the operations of our contract manufacturers or our suppliers 
in the past  outbreaks of sars have been significantly focused on asia  particularly in hong kong  where we have an office  and in the guangdong province of china  where almost all of our finished goods manufacturers are located 
in addition  recent outbreaks of avian influenza  or asian bird flu have occurred throughout asia  including cases in guangdong province 

table of contents the design  development and manufacture of our products could suffer if a significant number of our employees or the employees of our manufacturers or their suppliers contract sars or asian bird flu or otherwise are unable to fulfill their responsibilities or quarantine or other disease mitigation measures disrupt operations 
in the event of any significant outbreak  quarantine or other disruption  we may be unable to quickly identify or secure alternate suppliers or manufacturing facilities and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
our products are shipped from china and any disruption of shipping could harm our business 
we rely on four contract ocean carriers to ship virtually all of the products that we import to our primary distribution centers in california 
retailers that take delivery of our products in china rely on a variety of carriers to import those products 
any disruption or slowdown of service on importation of products caused by sars related issues  labor disputes  terrorism  international incidents  quarantines  lack of available shipping containers or otherwise could significantly harm our business and reputation 
for example  in  a key collective bargaining agreement between the pacific maritime association and the international longshore and warehouse union affecting shipping of products to the western united states  including our products  expired and  after a temporary extension  resulted in an eleven day cessation of work at west coast docks 
this cessation of work cost us approximately million in additional freight expenses 
although the pacific maritime association and international longshore and warehouse union have entered into a new collective bargaining agreement  any further disruption or slowdown of service on importation of products caused by labor disputes  terrorism  international incidents  lack of available shipping containers or otherwise could significantly harm our business and reputation 
we do not have long term agreements with our major suppliers  and they may stop manufacturing our components at any time 
we presently order our products on a purchase order basis from our component suppliers  and we do not have long term manufacturing agreements with any of them 
the absence of long term agreements means that  with little or no notice  our suppliers could refuse to manufacture some or all of our components  reduce the number of units of a component that they will manufacture or change the terms under which they manufacture our components 
if our suppliers stop manufacturing our components  we may be unable to find alternative suppliers on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all  which would harm our operating results 
in addition  if any of our suppliers changes the terms under which they manufacture for us  our costs could increase and our profitability would suffer 
we depend on our suppliers for our components  and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available 
some of the components used to make our products  including our asics  currently come from a single supplier 
additionally  the demand for some components such as liquid crystal displays  integrated circuits or other electronic components is volatile  which may lead to shortages 
if our suppliers are unable to meet our demand for our components and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price available from our current suppliers or an alternative source is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our products would be seriously harmed and our operating results would suffer 
if we do not correctly anticipate demand for particular products  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays  which would reduce our gross margins or cause us to lose sales 
historically  we have seen steady increases in demand for our products and have generally been able to increase production to meet that demand 
however  the demand for our products depends on many factors such as consumer preferences  including children s preferences  and the introduction or adoption of new hardware platforms for interactive educational products  and can be difficult to forecast 
we expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand for specific products as we introduce and support additional products  enter additional markets and as competition in our markets intensifies 
if we misjudge the demand for our products  we could face the following problems in our operations  each of which could harm our operating results if our forecasts of demand are too high  we may accumulate excess inventories of components and finished products  which could lead to markdown allowances or write offs affecting some or all of such excess inventories 
we may also have to adjust the prices of our existing products to reduce such excess inventories 
if demand for specific products increases beyond what we forecast  our suppliers and third party manufacturers may not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet the demand 
our failure to meet market demand would lead to missed opportunities to increase our base of users  damage our relationships with retailers and harm our business 

table of contents rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in increased manufacturing errors  as well as higher component  manufacturing and shipping costs  all of which could reduce our profit margins and harm our relationships with retailers and consumers 
any errors or defects contained in our products  or our failure to comply with applicable safety standards  could result in delayed shipments or rejection of our products  damage to our reputation and expose us to regulatory or other legal action 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  delays in releasing some models and versions of our products due to defects or errors in our products 
our products may contain errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in the rejection of our products by our retailers  damage to our reputation  lost sales  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims  any of which could harm our business 
children could sustain injuries from our products  and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries 
there is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside the scope of  our insurance coverage 
moreover  we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
we are subject to the federal hazardous substances act  the flammable fabrics act  regulation by the consumer product safety commission  or cpsc  and other similar federal and state rules and regulatory authorities 
our products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by such authorities 
concerns about potential liability may lead us to recall voluntarily selected products 
in december  the cpsc announced our voluntary repair program for the approximately  units of our alphabet pal product sold prior to that date 
we had instituted the repair proceedings with the cpsc because we were concerned that the product could cause injury 
our costs in connection with the repair were approximately million 
any recalls or post manufacture repairs of our products could harm our reputation  increase our costs or reduce our net sales 
our rapid growth has presented significant challenges to our management systems and resources  and we may experience difficulties managing our growth

any future attacks and the responses to such attacks  including military action in the middle east  or other significant events could further impact the economy 
further weakening of the economy could damage our sales in our us consumer and other segments 
other changes in general economic conditions  such as greater demand or higher prices for plastic  electronic components  liquid crystal displays and fuel  may delay manufacture of our products  increase our costs or otherwise harm our margins and operating results 
earthquakes or other events outside of our control may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend 
our two primary us distribution centers  our silicon valley engineering office and our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past 
an earthquake or other natural disasters could disrupt our operations

any of these disruptions or other events outside of our control could impair our distribution of products  damage inventory  interrupt critical functions or otherwise affect our business negatively  harming our operating results 
our existing earthquake insurance relating to our distribution center may be insufficient and does not cover any of our other operations 
if the facilities of our third party finished goods or component manufacturers are affected by earthquakes  power shortages  floods  monsoons  terrorism or other events outside of our control  our business could suffer

table of contents the limited voting rights of our class a common stock could negatively affect its attractiveness to investors and its liquidity and  as a result  its market value 
the holders of our class a and class b common stock generally have identical rights  except that holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders 
the holders of our class b common stock have various additional voting rights  including the right to approve the issuance of any additional shares of class b common stock and any amendment of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the rights of our class b common stock

provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our class a common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent and the voting power associated with our class b common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used by our board of directors to effect a rights plan or poison pill that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer and may have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of our company 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding voting stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders
