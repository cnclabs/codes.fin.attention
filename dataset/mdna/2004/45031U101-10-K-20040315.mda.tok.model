adjusted earnings adjusted earnings represents net income allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  amortization  gain from discontinued operations  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures reflect the company s share of adjusted earnings calculated on the same basis 
the company believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the historical operating results of the company  adjusted earnings should be examined in conjunction with net income as shown in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
adjusted earnings should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs or available for distribution to the company s shareholders 
the company s management believes that adjusted earnings more closely approximates operating cash flow and is a useful measure for investors to consider  in conjunction with net income and other gaap measures  in evaluating the company s financial performance 
this is primarily because the company is a commercial finance company that focuses on real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing  therefore  the company s net income determined in accordance with gaap reflects significant non cash depreciation expense on ctl assets and significant deferred financing costs 
in addition  several of the company s material borrowing arrangements contain covenants based on adjusted earnings  therefore  the company must monitor adjusted earnings in order to ensure compliance with these covenants 
it should be noted that the company s manner of calculating adjusted earnings may differ from the calculation of similarly titled measures by other companies

these assets and liabilities create a natural hedge against changes in variable interest rates 
this means that as interest rates increase  the company earns more on its variable rate lending assets and pays more on its variable rate debt obligations and  conversely  as interest rates decrease  the company earns less on its variable rate lending assets and pays less on its variable rate debt obligations 
when the amount of the company s variable rate debt obligations exceeds the amount of its variable rate lending assets  the company utilizes derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on its net income 
the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge assets or for speculative purposes 
the derivative instruments the company uses are typically in the form of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
interest rate swaps effectively change variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate caps effectively limit the maximum interest rate on variable rate debt obligations 
in addition  when appropriate the company enters into interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to variable rate in order to mitigate the risk of changes in fair value of the fixed rate debt obligations 
the primary risks from the company s use of derivative instruments is the risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement could default on its obligation and the risk that the company may have to pay certain costs  such as transaction fees or breakage costs  if a hedging arrangement is terminated by the company 
as a matter of policy  the company enters into hedging arrangements with counterparties that are large  creditworthy financial institutions typically rated at least a by standard poor s s p and a by moody s investors service moody s 
the company s hedging strategy is approved and monitored by the company s audit committee on behalf of its board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors without stockholder approval 
the company has entered into the following cash flow and fair value hedges that are outstanding as of december  the net value liability associated with these hedges is reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheets in thousands

between january  and december   the company also had outstanding the following cash flow hedges that have expired or been settled in thousands type of hedge notional amount strike price or swap rate trade date maturity date pay fixed swap  pay fixed swap  pay fixed swap  pay fixed swap  during  the company entered into two day forward starting swaps each having a million notional amount 
these pay fixed swaps which were effective in september  had rates of and  had seven year and year terms  respectively  and were used to lock in swap rates related to a portion of planned future corporate unsecured fixed rate bond issuances 
these two swaps were settled in connection with the company s issuance of million of seven year senior notes and million of year senior notes 
in addition  effective in september  the company entered into a million cap with a rate of to hedge the company s current outstanding floating rate debt 
this cap has a three year term 
further  the company entered into two million forward starting swaps 
these pay fixed swaps were effective in june and replaced the two million pay fixed swaps mentioned above 
the two new pay fixed swaps have a three year term and expire on june  in addition  in connection with a portion of the company s fixed rate corporate bonds  the company entered into three pay floating interest rate swaps in december struck at  and with notional amounts of million  million and million  respectively  and maturing on december  and entered into two pay floating interest rate swaps in november struck at and with notional amounts of million and million  respectively  and maturing on august  the company pays six month libor on the swaps entered into in december and one month libor on the swaps entered into in november and receives the stated fixed rate in return 
these swaps mitigate the risk of changes in the fair value of million of seven year senior notes and million of year senior notes attributable to changes in libor 
for accounting purposes  the difference between the fixed rate received and the libor rate paid on the notional amount of the swap is recorded as interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the company adjusts the value of the swap to its fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged liability by an offsetting amount on a quarterly basis 
in connection with stars  series in may  the company entered into a libor interest rate cap struck at in the notional amount of million  and simultaneously sold a libor interest rate cap with the same terms 
since these instruments do not change the company s net interest rate risk exposure  they do not qualify as hedges and changes in their respective values are charged to earnings 
as the terms of these arrangements are substantially the same  the effects of a revaluation of these two instruments substantially offset one another 
in connection with stars  series in may  the company entered into a libor interest rate cap struck at in the notional amount of million 
the company utilizes the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to such instruments 
sfas no 
provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps should be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income as part of interest expense in the affected period 
on may   in connection with the stars  series transaction  the company paid a premium of million for this interest rate cap 
using the caplet methodology discussed above  amortization of the cap premium is dependent upon the actual value of the caplets at inception 
during the year ended december   the company refinanced its million term loan maturing march  with a million term loan maturing march  the term loan bears interest at per annum  payable monthly  and amortizes over an approximately year schedule 
the term loan represented forecasted transactions for which the company had previously entered into us treasury based hedging transactions 
the net million cost of the settlement of such hedges has been deferred and is being amortized as an increase to the effective financing cost of the term loan over its effective ten year term 
certain of the company s ctl joint ventures  have hedging activities which are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet transactions the company is not dependent on the use of any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
as of december   the company had investments in three ctl joint ventures accounted for under the equity method  which had total debt obligations outstanding of approximately million 
the company s pro rata share of the ventures third party debt was approximately million see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
these ventures were formed for the purpose of operating  acquiring and in certain cases  developing ctl facilities 
the debt obligations of these joint ventures are non recourse to the ventures and the company  and mature between fiscal years and as of december   the debt obligations consisted of six term loans bearing fixed rates per annum ranging from to and one variable rate term loan with a rate of libor per annum 
the company s stars securitizations are all on balance sheet financings 
the company has certain discretionary and non discretionary unfunded commitments related to its loans and other lending investments that it may need to  or choose to  fund in the future 
discretionary commitments are those under which the company has sole discretion with respect to future funding 
non discretionary commitments are those under which the company is generally obligated to fund at the request of the borrower or upon the occurrence of events outside of the company s direct control 
as of december   the company had loans with unfunded commitments totaling million  of which million was discretionary and million was non discretionary 
ratings triggers on july   the company completed a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of leading financial institutions 
the facility has an initial maturity of july with a one year extension at the company s option and another one year extension at the lenders option 
on may   the company extended the final maturity to july this facility replaces two prior credit facilities maturing in and  and bears interest at libor per annum based on the company s senior unsecured credit ratings of bb from s p  ba from moody s and bbb from fitch ratings 
if the company achieves a higher rating from either s p or moody s  the facility s interest rate will improve to libor per annum 
if the company s credit rating is downgraded by any of the rating agencies regardless of how far  the facility s interest rate will increase to libor per annum 
in the event the company receives two credit ratings that are not equivalent  the spread over libor shall be determined by the lower of the two such ratings 
as of december   million was outstanding on this facility 
accordingly  management does not believe any rating changes would have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
there are no other ratings triggers in any of the company s debt instruments or other operating or financial agreements 
on july   the company s senior unsecured credit rating was upgraded to an investment grade rating of bbb from bb by fitch ratings 
in addition  moody s and s p raised their ratings outlook for the company s senior unsecured credit rating to positive 
on october   moody s confirmed its rating of ba and its ratings outlook of positive for the company 
on november   s p also reaffirmed its rating of bb and its ratings outlook of positive for the company 
transactions with related parties the company has an investment in istar operating inc istar operating  a taxable subsidiary that  through a wholly owned subsidiary  services the company s loans and certain loan portfolios owned by third parties 
the company owns all of the non voting preferred stock and a economic interest in istar operating 
the common shareholder  an entity controlled by a former director of the company  is the owner of all the voting common stock and a economic interest in istar operating 
as of december   there have never been any distributions to the common shareholder  nor does the company expect to make any in the future 
at any time  the company has the right to acquire all of the common stock of istar operating at fair market value  which the company believes to be nominal 
istar operating has elected to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary for purposes of maintaining compliance with the reit provisions of the code and prior to july  was accounted for under the equity method for financial statement reporting purposes and was presented in investments in and advances to joint ventures and unconsolidated subsidiaries on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
as of july   the company consolidates this entity as a vie see note to the company s consolidated financial statements with no material impact 
prior to its consolidation  the company charged an allocated portion of its general overhead expenses to istar operating based on the number of employees at istar operating as a percentage of the company s total employees 
these general overhead expenses were in addition to the direct general and administrative costs of istar operating 
as of december   istar operating had no debt obligations 
in addition  the company had an investment in trinet management operating company  inc tmoc  an entity originally formed to make a million investment in the convertible debt securities of a real estate company which trades on the mexican stock exchange 
this investment was made by trinet prior to its acquisition by the company in prior to march   the company owned of the outstanding voting and non voting common stock representing voting power and of the economic interest in tmoc 
the owners of the remaining tmoc stock were two executives of the company 
on march   the company purchased the remaining interest from the executives for approximately  an amount that was equal to the carrying value  which was less than their original investment 
following this purchase  the company owned of tmoc and therefore consolidated the entity for accounting purposes 
on june   the million investment was fully repaid and prior to december   the entity was liquidated 
the company entered into an employment agreement with its chief executive officer as of march  in addition to the salary and bonus provisions of the agreement  the agreement provides for an award of million phantom units to the executive  each of which notionally represents one share of the company s common stock 
portions of these phantom units will vest on a contingent basis if the average closing price of the company s common stock achieves certain levels ranging from to per share for consecutive calendar days 
the total rate of return share price appreciation plus the reinvestment of dividends at market price on the date of distribution from december  through december  was 
contingently vested units will become fully vested  meaning that they are no longer subject to forfeiture  if the executive remains employed through march   or earlier upon certain change of control and termination events 
when and if contingently vested phantom units become fully vested units  the company must deliver to the executive either a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of fully vested units or an amount of cash equal to the then fair market value of that number of shares of common stock 
if shares were unavailable under the company s then long term incentive plans  this obligation could require the company to make a substantial cash payment to the executive 
see critical accounting policies executive compensation below for a discussion of the accounting treatment applicable to the compensation awarded to the chief executive officer under this agreement 
as more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements certain affiliates of sof iv and the company s executive officer have agreed to reimburse the company for the value of restricted shares awarded to the former president in excess of  shares 
drip stock purchase plan the company maintains a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
under the dividend reinvestment component of the plan  the company s shareholders may purchase additional shares of common stock without payment of brokerage commissions or service charges by automatically reinvesting all or a portion of their common stock cash dividends 
under the direct stock purchase component of the plan  the company s shareholders and new investors may purchase shares of common stock directly from the company without payment of brokerage commissions or service charges 
all purchases of shares in excess of  per month pursuant to the direct purchase component are at the company s sole discretion 
shares issued under the plan may reflect a discount of up to from the prevailing market price of the company s common stock 
the company is authorized to issue up to million shares of common stock pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
during the months ended december  and  the company issued a total of approximately million and million shares of its common stock  respectively  through the direct stock purchase component of the plan 
net proceeds during the months ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
there are approximately million shares available for issuance under the plan as of december  stock repurchase program the board of directors approved  and the company has implemented  a stock repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock from time to time  primarily using proceeds from the disposition of assets or loan repayments and excess cash flow from operations  but also using borrowings under its credit facilities if the company determines that it is advantageous to do so 
as of december   the company had repurchased a total of approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company has not repurchased any shares under the stock repurchase program since november critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with gaap 
during  management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the more significant of these to be as follows revenue recognition the most significant sources of the company s revenue come from its lending operations and its ctl operations 
for its lending operations  the company reflects income using the effective yield method  which recognizes periodic income over the expected term of the investment on a constant yield basis 
for ctl assets  the company recognizes income on the straight line method  which effectively recognizes contractual lease payments to be received by the company evenly over the term of the lease 
management believes the company s revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
provision for loan losses the company s accounting policies require that an allowance for estimated credit losses be reflected in the financial statements based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in its private lending assets 
while the company and its private predecessors have experienced minimal actual losses on their lending investments  management considers it prudent to reflect provisions for loan losses on a portfolio basis based upon the company s assessment of general market conditions  the company s internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  the company s assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying its investments 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounting policy requires a reserve on the company s accrued operating lease income receivable balances and on the deferred operating lease income receivable balances 
the reserve covers asset specific problems eg  bankruptcy as they arise  as well as  a portfolio reserve based on management s evaluation of the credit risks associated with these receivables 
impairment of long lived assets ctl assets represent long lived assets for accounting purposes 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets to be held and used in its leasing operations for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in management s opinion  based on this analysis  ctl assets to be held and used are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated recoverable amounts 
risk management and financial instrument the company has historically utilized derivative financial instruments only as a means to help to manage its interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its variable rate debt obligations ie  as cash flow hedges 
the instruments utilized are generally either pay fixed swaps or libor based interest rate caps which are widely used in the industry and typically with major financial institutions 
the company s accounting policies generally reflect these instruments at their fair value with unrealized changes in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income losses on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
realized effects on the company s cash flows are generally recognized currently in income 
however  when appropriate the company enters into interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to variable rate in order to mitigate the risk of changes in fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations 
the company reflects these instruments at their fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged liability by an offsetting amount 
income taxes the company s financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that the company has and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow it to be taxed as a reit and  as a result  does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company were to fail to meet these requirements  the company would be subject to federal income tax 
executive compensation the company s accounting policies generally provide cash compensation to be estimated and recognized over the period of service 
with respect to stock based compensation arrangements  as of july  with retroactive application to the beginning of the calendar year  the company has adopted the fair value method allowed under sfas no 
on a prospective basis  which values options on the date of grant and recognizes an expense equal to the fair value of the option multiplied by the number of options granted over the related service period 
prior to the third quarter  the company elected to use apb accounting  which measured the compensation charges based on the intrinsic value of such securities when they become fixed and determinable  and recognized such expense over the related service period 
these arrangements are often complex and generally structured to align the interests of management with those of the company s shareholders 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of such arrangements and the related accounting effects 
during  the company entered into three year employment agreements with its chief executive officer and its former president 
in addition  during the company entered into a three year employment agreement with its chief financial officer 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these employment agreements 
the following is a hypothetical illustration of the effects on the company s net income and adjusted earnings of the full vesting of phantom units under the employment agreement with the chief executive officer 
during the months ended december   million of the phantom shares awarded to the chief executive officer were contingently vested 
absent an earlier change of control or termination of employment  these million shares will not become fully vested until march  assuming that the market price of the common stock on march  is which was the market price of the common stock on december   the company would incur a one time charge to earnings at that time of approximately million the fair market value of the million shares at per share subject to the availability of million shares under the company s long term incentive plan 
on april   the  unvested restricted shares awarded to the president became contingently vested as the total shareholder return exceeded and became fully vested on september  as all employment contingencies were met 
the company incurred a charge of approximately million related to these vested shares  recognized ratably over the service period from the date of contingent vesting through september  new ceo employment agreement the march employment agreement with the company s chief executive officer expires on march  subsequent to december   the company entered into a new employment agreement with its chief executive officer which will take effect upon the expiration of the old agreement 
the new agreement has an initial term of three years and provides for the following compensation an annual salary of million  a potential annual cash incentive award of up to million if performance goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors in consultation with the chief executive officer are met  and a one time award of common stock with a value of million at march  based upon the trailing day average closing price of the common stock  the award will be fully vested when granted and dividends will be paid on the shares from the date of grant  but the shares cannot be sold for five years unless the price of the common stock during the months ending march of each year increases by at least  in which case the sale restrictions on of the shares awarded will lapse in respect of each month period 
in addition  the chief executive officer will purchase an interest in the company s high performance unit program for directors and executive officers 
this performance program was approved by the company s shareholders in and is described in detail in the company s annual proxy statement 
the purchase price to be paid by the chief executive officer will be based upon a valuation prepared by an independent investment banking firm 
the interests purchased by the chief executive officer will only have nominal value to him unless the company achieves total shareholder returns in excess of those achieved by peer group indices  all as more fully described in the company s annual proxy statement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing its business plan  the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with its liability management objectives  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
the company s operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on its assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on the company s interest bearing assets  which the company may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on its borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread the difference in the principal amount outstanding between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of the company s interest bearing assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of the company s interest earning assets 
a substantial portion of the company s loan investments are subject to significant prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to the company 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while the company generally seeks to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  the company could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
while the company has not experienced any significant credit losses  in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to the company which adversely affect its liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company employs match funding based hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on its operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  floors  swaps  futures and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce the company s exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes nor as a hedge against changes in credit risk of its borrowers or of the company itself 
each interest rate cap or floor agreement is a legal contract between the company and a third party the counterparty 
when the company purchases a cap or floor contract  the company makes an up front payment to the counterparty and the counterparty agrees to make payments to the company in the future should the reference rate typically one or three month libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
each contract has a notional face amount 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  the company will earn cap income 
should the reference rate fall below the contractual strike rate in a floor  the company will earn floor income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
the company utilizes the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to such instruments

provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income and are included in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations in the affected period 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
in general  the company s swaps are pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of variable rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from the company 
however  when appropriate the company enters into pay floating swaps involving the exchange of fixed rate interest payments from the counterparty for variable rate interest payments from the company  which mitigates the risk of changes in fair value of the company s fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate futures are contracts  generally settled in cash  in which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date the cash equivalent of the difference between the specified price or yield indicated in the contract and the value of the specified instrument ie  ie treasury securities upon settlement 
under these agreements  the company would generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments would be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  the company would cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
while a reit may freely utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities  the use of derivatives for other purposes  including hedging asset related risks such as credit  prepayment or interest rate exposure on the company s loan assets  could generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining reit status 
as a consequence  the company may only engage in such instruments to hedge such risks on a limited basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which the company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
the company is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  the company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that the company will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract it enters into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income and net fair value of financial instruments should interest rates increase or decrease   or basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases as of december   less related interest expense and operating costs on ctl assets  for the year ended december  net fair value of financial instruments is calculated as the sum of the value of derivative instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets  less cash out flows in respect of interest bearing liabilities as of december  the cash flows associated with the company s assets are calculated based on management s best estimate of expected payments for each loan based on loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history  prepayment penalty  term and collateral type 
most of the company s loans are protected from prepayment as a result of prepayment penalties and contractual terms which prohibit prepayments during specified periods 
however  for those loans where prepayments are not currently precluded by contract  declines in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds 
the base interest rate scenario assumes the one month libor rate of as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table
