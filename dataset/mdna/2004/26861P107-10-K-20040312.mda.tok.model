the company s mortgage revenues are derived from the origination and sale of loans 
mortgage loans are funded through the company s warehouse lines of credit and sold to mortgage loan purchasers typically within thirty days 
mortgage loan revenues consist of proceeds in excess of the carrying value of the loan  origination fees less certain direct origination costs and other processing costs 
these revenues are recognized at the time the loan is sold 
mortgage revenues consist of refinance mortgage revenues and diversified mortgage revenues which are comprised of purchase and non prime mortgage loans 
mortgage revenues benefited significantly from a sharp increase in refinance revenues starting in the third quarter of and reaching its peak in the second quarter of refinance revenue experienced large declines in the third and fourth quarters of as interest rates increased and the overall mortgage market shifted away from refinance volume 
diversified mortgage revenues increased significantly starting in the first quarter of through the third quarter of  coming down in the fourth quarter of the decline in the fourth quarter of was due to seasonal weakness  coupled with intense price competition in the market as a result of the evaporating refinance market 
the company expects refinance activity to continue to decline in and that while growth in diversified mortgages is expected  we do not anticipate that it will completely offset the decline in refinance volume  resulting in a lower mortgage revenue amount in as compared to the following table summarizes dollar volume of mortgage loans sold and the revenue in both dollars and average basis points bps dollars in thousands except bps three months end ed march  june  sept

the company generates revenues from interest income on mortgage and home equity loans 
the revenues realized are based on the loan amount multiplied by the contractual interest rate from the time of funding by the company through time of sale 
these revenues are recognized as earned during the period from funding to sale 
interest income is highly correlated to the volume of loans funded 
as such  the company anticipates that with relatively lower mortgage revenue in  interest income on mortgages will be slightly lower 
home equity fundings are expected to increase in  as will interest income on home equity loans and lines of credit 
home equity revenues 
home equity revenues are derived from the origination and sale of loans 
home equity loans are funded through the company s warehouse lines of credit and sold to home equity loan purchasers in approximately thirty days 
home equity loan revenues consist of proceeds in excess of the carrying value of the loan  origination fees less certain direct origination costs and other processing costs 
these revenues are recognized at the time the loan is sold 
home equity revenues increased from million to million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of and from million to million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of as revenue per loan on home equity loans sold has remained relatively constant  the fluctuation in revenue is mostly attributable to the volume of sold loans in any given quarter 
the company expects that home equity revenues will grow throughout as volumes continue to increase 
auto revenues 
the company funds prime auto loans using a line of credit and then sells them to a qualified special purpose entity qspe  which was created in july revenues from these sales consist of the estimated future discounted cash flows net of interest  servicing fees and credit losses 
revenues on prime auto loan sales are recognized when the loan is sold to the qspe 
prior to the third quarter of  sub prime auto loans were sold to sub prime auto loan purchasers 
the revenue on these loans consisted of the mark up to the lending partner s loan price or a set origination fee 
these revenues were recognized at the time the loan was sold 
in the third quarter of  the company stopped processing and funding sub prime auto loans and shifted this portion of the business to a referral based system 
loan applications that do not meet the prime auto lending criteria are referred out to other sub prime lenders in exchange for a fee 
this fee is recognized as revenue at the time of transfer to the sub prime lender and paid to the company monthly for the previous month s referrals 
auto revenues increased from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of from million to million and decreased from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of from million to million 
the increase in auto revenues during is largely a result of the new qspe structure introduced in june that improved our ability to offer competitive rates to consumers while increasing our gain on sale execution compared to our prior correspondent loan sales 
the decline in is largely attributed to the company s decision to transition its sub prime loan platform from self funding to a referral basis in the third quarter of as expected  this transition resulted in a reduction in overall auto loan volume 
the company assumes continued pressure from incentive financing rates coupled with the elimination of sub prime volume  will result in relatively flat auto revenues as compared to operating expenses total operating expenses 
total operating expenses include operational costs associated with the origination of mortgage  home equity and auto loans  including interest expense on warehouse lines  as well as costs associated with marketing  technology and administrative

the growth in direct margin in is due largely to the contribution from increased mortgage and home equity volume  as well as increased revenue per loan  coupled with technology and process improvements 
additionally  the increase in direct margin in is due to the positive spread of interest income over interest expense 
the decline in direct margin in is primarily due to decreased mortgage revenue per loan and decreased mortgage volumes 
this decrease was offset by increased home equity volumes and revenues as well as a positive spread of home equity interest income over interest expense 
the company anticipates that mortgage revenue per loan and the spread of interest income over interest expense will decline in as compared to  as the overall level of refinance activity declines and competitive pricing pressure increases 
auto direct margin turned negative in the first and second quarters of due to the transition of auto operations from florida to california which started in the first quarter and completed in the second quarter of auto direct margins returned to positive levels in the third and fourth quarters of increasing from million in the third quarter to million by the fourth quarter of the company expects auto direct margin to grow modestly throughout sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense is primarily comprised of expenses excluding non cash marketing costs related to advertising  promotion and marketing agreements and employee compensation and other expenses related to marketing personnel

valuation of derivative instruments 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities sfas  as subsequently amended by statement of financial accounting no 
in accounting for its derivative financial instruments  sfas requires an entity to recognize all derivative assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use in assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffectiveness of the hedge 
these methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
the company is a party to mortgage rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both the company and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks their interest rate  the company effectively extends a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but the company must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
under sfas mortgage interest rate locks are derivatives 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
the company utilizes either a best efforts sell forward commitment or a mandatory sell forward commitment to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
both best efforts and mandatory sell forward sale commitments are derivatives under sfas throughout the lock period the changes in the market value of interest rate lock commitments  best efforts and mandatory forward sale commitments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and are included in the statement of operations in mortgage revenue 
the company s management has made complex judgments in their application of sfas the judgments include the identification of hedging instruments  hedged items  nature of the risk being hedged  and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
the company designates forward delivery commitments  where the company intends to deliver the underlying loan into the commitment  as a fair value sfas hedge at the commitment date 
in addition  the company designates all best efforts sell forward commitments as fair value sfas hedges for underlying loans at funding date 
the company does not designate mandatory sell forward agreements as sfas hedges but does utilize them to economically hedge the changes in fair value of rate lock commitments with borrowers for which a best efforts sell forward commitment has not been obtained 
the company did not have a material gain or loss representing the amount of hedge ineffectiveness related to designated sfas hedges during the twelve months ended december  and in september  the company began hedging its interest rate risk on auto loan approvals 
when the company issues an auto loan approval  the company extends a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but the company must honor the interest rate for up to a day period 
under sfas  auto loan approvals are not considered derivatives 
however  the company is still exposed to interest rate risk from issuance of approval to loan sale 
the company enters into amortizing swap contracts to economically hedge the interest rate changes in auto loan approvals 
these swap contracts are considered derivatives under sfas the company marks to market any changes in the value of outstanding swap contracts  which are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and included in the statement of operations in auto revenue 
capitalized software 
in  the company adopted sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which requires that the company expense computer software costs as they are incurred in the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of the sop have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software are capitalized 
capitalized costs are generally amortized over one to three years on a straight line basis 
eserves for loan originations 
the company sells loans to loan purchasers on a servicing released basis without recourse 
as such  the risk of loss or default by the borrower has generally been assumed by these purchasers 
however  the company is usually required by these purchasers to make certain representations relating to credit information  loan documentation and collateral 
to the extent that the company does not comply with such representations  or there are early payment defaults  the company may be required to repurchase loans or indemnify these purchasers for any losses from borrower defaults 
in connection with a majority of its loan sales agreements  the company is also responsible for a minimum number of payments to be made on each loan  or else the company may be required to refund the premium paid to it by the loan purchaser 
as such  the company records reserves based on certain assumptions in anticipation of future losses as a result of current activity 
loan loss reserves due to potential violations of representations and warranties are recorded based on a percentage of current month originations 
the company currently calculates this loss rate exposure based on its historical loss rates as well as similar lending portfolios 
once the company has endured a complete economic cycle  the rate will be adjusted based on actual losses as a percentage of origination volume on a historical basis 
premium repayment reserves  generated through early loan prepayments related to loans sold to investors  are recorded based on a rate determined by calculating actual prepayments as a percentage of originations on a historical basis applied to current month originations 
stock compensation 
the company accounts for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  and complies with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is based on the excess of the estimated fair value of the company s stock over the exercise price  if any  on the date of grant 
the company accounts for stock issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and the emerging issues task force consensus in issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to non employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
deferred tax asset 
the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
management evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
the company s deferred tax asset arises principally from net operating loss carryforward nols 
there are significant judgments and estimates involved in projecting the recoverability of the deferred tax asset  particularly with respect to the existence of future taxable income sufficient to realize nols 
the company reported its first profitable year in and was again profitable in however  the sustained low interest rate environment created favorable operating conditions for the company 
during the fourth quarter of  mortgage refinancing volume declined sharply and the company reported a loss from operations and is projecting a loss for the first quarter of management will continue to monitor projections of future taxable income and when it believes realization of the tax benefits associated with the nols is more likely than not  management will reduce the valuation allowance by recording a benefit through the income tax provision recorded in the statement of operations 
based upon the company s performance throughout the coming year it is possible that management would reduce the valuation allowance during  however  management can provide no assurances as to the amount of such reduction  the period in which it might occur or if it will occur at all 
off balance sheet arrangements retained interest in auto loans 
on june   the company entered into an arrangement to sell auto loan receivables to a qualified special purpose entity qspe  e loan auto fund one  llc e loan auto  for the purpose of being able to recognize the gain on sale from these loans 
these transactions involve the company surrendering control over these assets to assure that the sold assets have been isolated from the company and its creditors 
as e loan auto has met the appropriate tests to be considered a qspe the assets and liabilities of e loan auto are appropriately not consolidated in financial statements of the company 
in the event that the entity no longer qualifies as a qspe and is required to be consolidated  the company would no longer be in compliance with certain debt covenants related to its warehouse and other lines of credit  as currently structured 
in particular  the company s debt to tangible net worth covenants would be exceeded  however management believes that it would be able to renegotiate its existing warehouse related covenants to adequately accommodate the consolidation of this entity  if needed 
e loan auto has obtained a secured borrowing facility from merrill lynch bank usa to finance all purchases of loans from the company 
the company recognizes a gain on the sale of auto loan receivables to e loan auto in the period in which the sale occurs  which represents the difference between the sale proceeds to the company and the company s net carrying value of the receivables 
the company retains an interest in the future cash flows from the loans 
such cash flows are distributed to the company by the qspe monthly 
the fair value of the retained interest asset is based upon the net present value of the estimated future cash flows to be received by the company over the life of the loans 
these retained interest assets are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as trading assets  and are adjusted to estimated fair value at each subsequent reporting period 
changes in the estimated fair value of the residual interests are recorded through the statement of operations 
estimates of future cash flows to be received by the company reflect assumptions regarding the cumulative credit losses to be incurred on the pool of auto loan receivables sold  prepayment rates of the auto loans and the rate at which the estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 
the assumptions used represent the company s best estimates  and the use of different assumptions could produce different financial results 
the company will continue to monitor and update its assumptions over time 
sale agreement with greenwich capital 
the company has an uncommitted mortgage loan purchase and sale agreement with greenwich capital  for the purpose of controlling the timing associated with loan sales 
under the terms of this agreement  mortgage loans which are subject to a mandatory sell forward commitment between the company and an investor  but have not yet been purchased  may be sold to greenwich capital with the accompanying trade assignment 
revenues from loans sold under this arrangement are included as a receivable on the balance sheet 
all loans sold under this arrangement are already committed to another investor  and as such  hold little risk of being unsaleable 
therefore  in the event that the company was unable to utilize this arrangement  the company would experience a one time impact to revenues in the period this arrangement was discontinued liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of cash include cash from the sale of mortgage  home equity and auto loans  borrowings under warehouse lines of credit and other credit facilities  brokerage fees  interest income  credit card referrals and the sale of debt and equity securities in both private and public transactions 
the company s uses of cash include the funding of mortgage  home equity and auto loans  repayment of amounts borrowed under warehouse lines of credit  operating expenses  payment of interest  and capital expenditures primarily comprised of furniture  fixtures  computer equipment  software and leasehold improvements 
because the company s loan origination operating activities are funded principally through its warehouse and other lines payable  the company analyzes trends in operating cash flows by combining cash flows from operating activities with cash flows from certain financing activities specifically cash flows from warehouse and other lines payable 
cash used in operating activities  net of cash provided by financing activities related to its warehouse and other lines payable was million for the twelve months ended december  the company obtained cash from the net income of million for the twelve months ended december  additionally  the company benefited from positive cash flow as a result of loans held for sale net of warehouse payable decreasing and providing million in net cash 
however  these sources of cash were offset by two major uses of cash the receivable related to the greenwich sale agreement increased million as more loans were sold under this agreement and at a higher revenue loan than the comparable period the year before  and the retained interest asset continued to increase  going up another million as additional loans were sold to the qspe in cash used in operating activities  net of cash provided by financing activities related to its warehouse and other lines payable was million for the twelve months ended december  the net change in loans held for sale less the related warehouse payable resulted in a cash usage of million in the twelve months ended december  this is due to the overall increase in the loans held for sale balances less the amount advanced by the warehouse lenders 
additionally  million of cash was used in the increase of the retained interest asset for the qspe started in june of both of these amounts were offset by cash provided by the increase in the income tax payable related to taxes estimated to be paid in for the year ended note that fiscal year was the first profitable year for the company  and as such  resulted in taxable income 
while the company has significant amounts of net operating loss carryforwards nols  the state of california imposed a two year moratorium on the usage of nols for the tax years and net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities during and was entirely related to purchases of software  furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
the increase in was primarily due to the addition of infrastructure related to increased headcount and investment in new technology systems 
in  the company relocated its corporate headquarters to a new  larger facility in pleasanton  california 
capital expenditures related to the new facility net of tenant improvement allowances were million for the twelve months ended december  the company will complete the buildout of its new facility in the first half of  and as a result expects to spend an additional million to complete the project 
cash provided by financing activities  net of cash used by its warehouse and other lines payable was million for the twelve months ended december  and million for the twelve months ended december  the large increase from to was due to the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  as a result of the company s increased stock price during the second and third quarters of the company has committed and uncommitted warehouse lines of credit that it uses to fund mortgage and home equity loans 
a committed line is a firm commitment from the warehouse lender that funds will be available if requested 
the company pays for these committed funds either in the form of pre paid commitment fees charged as a percentage of the committed line available  or in the form of an unused line fee  which is assessed monthly based on a percentage of the unused amount during the previous month 
uncommitted funds are available to the company at the warehouse lenders discretion  and could potentially not be accessible by the company if the warehouse lender denied the funding request 
the company has not experienced such a denied funding request from any of its current or previous warehouse lenders 
the company has a warehouse line of credit for borrowings of up to million for the interim financing of mortgage loans with gmac mortgage corporation 
the interest rate charged on borrowings against these funds is variable based on libor plus various percentage points 
this warehouse line requires the company to pay gmac a non use fee when the average outstanding principal amount of borrowings is less than of the total commitment at a rate of per annum on the daily average unutilized commitment 
borrowings are collateralized by the related mortgage loans held for sale 
the committed line of credit expires on march  upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing line or obtain sufficient additional lines 
this line of credit agreement generally requires the company to comply with various financial and non financial covenants 
in particular  the company must maintain a minimum cash balance of million in addition to the requirement that the company maintain at least one other committed warehouse facility of no less than million 
failure to comply with these  or any other covenants  could result in the obligation to repay all amounts then outstanding 
the company had to obtain a waiver as a result of failure to meet a current ratio covenant for the months ended april  and may   but was in compliance with all covenants for this agreement for all other periods and at december  the company has an uncommitted warehouse line of credit for borrowings of up to million for the interim financing of mortgage loans with merrill lynch mortgage capital inc the interest rate charged on borrowings against these funds is variable based on libor plus various percentage points 
borrowings are collateralized by the related mortgage loans held for sale 
the uncommitted line of credit expires on february  upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing line or obtain sufficient additional lines 
this line of credit agreement generally requires the company to comply with various financial and non financial covenants 
in particular  the company must maintain a minimum cash balance of million 
failure to comply with these  or any other covenants  could result in the obligation to repay all amounts then outstanding 
this line of credit facility was added subsequent to the year ended december  the company has an agreement to finance up to million of mortgage loan inventory pending sale of these loans to the ultimate mortgage loan investors with greenwich capital 
of this amount  million is available in committed funds 
this loan inventory financing is secured by the related mortgage loans 
the interest rate charged on borrowings against these funds is based on libor plus various percentage points 
as part of this agreement the company had to pay a commitment fee of million for the period of march  through march  the commitment fee was reduced to  for the period march  through march  the line requires the restriction of million in cash as additional collateral  however  in march  the line was amended to remove this restriction 
the line expires march  upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing line or obtain sufficient additional lines 
this agreement includes various financial and non financial covenants 
in particular  the company must maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalents balance of million 
additionally  the company is required to maintain at least one other warehouse facility of no less than million in committed funds 
failure to comply with these  or any other covenants  could result in the obligation to repay all amounts then outstanding 
the company was in compliance with all debt covenants for this agreement during the year ended and at december  on june   the company secured a million line of credit facility with merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc to support the interim funding of auto loans prior to the sale to the ultimate auto loan purchaser 
the interest rate charged on this line is based on libor plus various percentage points 
this facility requires the company to pay an unused line fee equal to per year on the average daily unused line balance

failure to comply with these  or any other covenants  could result in the obligation to repay all amounts then outstanding 
the company was in compliance with all debt covenants for this agreement during the year ended and at december  the following table summarizes the key terms of our current warehouse and other lines payable gmac greenwich merrill merrill mortgage capital lynch lynch m m m m cost of funds spread over libor covenants minimum cash m m m m minimum tangible net worth m m m m debt to tangible net worth net worth prior profitability qtrs current ratio additional facility m m advance rates inclusive of all restricted cash  not to exceed million on july  the company issued a million convertible note to the charles schwab corporation  which was convertible into shares of its common stock at a conversion price of per share and which was scheduled to mature on january  the convertible note bore interest at a rate of per annum and was payable quarterly 
on march   the company elected to redeem the note prior to its maturity date 
under the terms of the note  the company notified schwab of its intent to redeem the note on april  by payment of  of the unpaid principal as of the date of redemption 
on april   the charles schwab corporation exercised its option to convert the amount due under the note into  shares of the company s common stock  in lieu of repayment  and therefore the note was converted rather than redeemed 
on june   the company obtained a million line of credit from wells fargo bank  national association to support working capital needs 
the interest rate charged on borrowings against these funds is based on libor plus  and is payable monthly 
the line of credit expires on june  on december   the agreement was amended to reduce the line of credit to  and extend the expiration date to june  as part of the amendment  the company was required to provide restricted cash as collateral for this line of credit 
currently  the line of credit is being utilized to support letters of credit related to the new pleasanton  california facility as well as a letter of credit related to the company s surety bonds 
the company was in compliance with all debt covenants for this agreement during the year ended and at december  the adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to successfully generate positive cash flow from an appropriate combination of efficient operations and improvements therein  financing from third parties and access to capital markets 
with million of cash on hand at december  and borrowing capacity under our warehouse and other lines of credit of million  we believe our liquidity including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate will be sufficient to meet operating cash flow requirements as they occur for at least the next twelve months  however  our ability to maintain positive liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access to the financial markets  both of which are subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other market factors that are beyond our control 
the following are return on equity and asset ratios for the years ended december  and december  return on assets return on equity equity to assets net income divided by average total assets  multiplied by net income divided by average equity  multiplied by average equity divided by average total assets  multiplied by factors affecting future operating results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
while we achieved our first profitable year during fiscal year  we have a history of losses  and we may not be able to maintain profitability 
while we achieved our first profitable year during  we have an accumulated deficit of million  as of december  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a pre tax loss of million and may not regain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history and consequently face significant risks and challenges in building our business 
we were incorporated in august  initiated our online mortgage operations in june and acquired our online auto operations in september we cannot assure that the company will be able to operate successfully if a downturn in the mortgage or auto business occurs 
as a result of our limited operating history  our recent growth and our reporting responsibilities as a public company  we may need to expand operational  financial and administrative systems and control procedures to enable us to further train and manage our employees and coordinate the efforts of our underwriting  accounting  finance  marketing  and operations departments 
our quarterly financial results are vulnerable to significant fluctuations and seasonality  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of social and economic factors 
certain months or quarters historically experience greater volumes of mortgage and auto loan applications and funded loans 
moreover  the level and direction of interest rates regulate the relative volatility of seasonal loan origination cycles 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our operating results may not meet the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
interest rate fluctuations could significantly reduce customers incentive to refinance existing mortgage loans 
rising interest rates generally reduce the demand for mortgage loans 
due to the low interest rate environment for the last several years  a significant percentage of our mortgage customers used our services to refinance existing mortgage loans 
as mortgage interest rates have risen  consumers incentive to refinance has been greatly reduced and the number of refinance loans that we originated and the revenues generated from those loans declined significantly 
in an environment of rising or high interest rates relative to the interest rates on existing loans  refinance loan revenue could continue to decline 
if we are unable to increase diversified product revenue to offset the decline in refinance loan activity  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our ability to engage in profitable secondary sales of loans may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
the mortgage loan purchase commitments we obtain are contingent upon our delivery of the relevant loans to the purchasers within specified periods 
to the extent that we are unable to deliver the loans within the specified periods and interest rates increase during those periods  we may experience no gain or even a loss on the sale of these loans 
in addition  any increase in interest rates will increase the cost of maintaining our warehouse and repurchase lines of credit on which we depend to fund the loans we originate 
the interest direct margin earned on loans held for sale significantly benefited from the spread between long term and short term interest rates starting in and continuing through the second quarter of based on historical trends  we do not expect the same level of benefit from interest rate spreads in a normal market 
we have implemented a hedging program to manage the risk of loss due to fluctuations in interest rates  but our hedging efforts may not be successful  and no hedging strategy can completely eliminate interest rate risk 
a sharp decrease in interest rates over a short period may cause customers who have interest rates on mortgage loans committed through us to either delay closing their loans or refinance with another lender 
if this occurs in significant numbers  it may have an adverse effect on our business or quarterly results of operations 
our hedging strategy may not succeed in reducing our exposure to losses caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk exposure on mortgage loan interest rate locks through hedging transactions using a combination of forward sales of mortgage backed securities and forward whole loan sales to fix the sales price of loans we expect to fund 
an effective hedging strategy is complex  and we have limited experience administering a hedging program 
a successful hedging program depends in part on our ability to properly estimate the number of loans that will actually close and is subject to fluctuations in the prices of mortgage backed securities  which do not necessarily move in tandem with the prices of loans we originate and close 
to the extent that we implement a hedging strategy but are unable to effectively match our purchases and sales of mortgage backed securities with the sale of the closed loans we have originated  our gains on sales of mortgage loans will be reduced  or we will experience a net loss on those sales 
in addition  in september  we began managing our interest rate exposure related to our auto loan approvals by entering into amortizing swap contracts 
approved auto loan applicants are provided a guaranteed rate for up to a day period 
to the extent that we implement a hedging strategy but are unable to effectively match our coverage with anticipated loan volume  it is possible that we could experience a net loss on those loan approvals 
finally  if we are unable to obtain the necessary liquidity to execute our hedging programs through multiple hedge counterparties  our hedging strategy may not succeed 
we currently have one counter party for auto hedging and counterparties for mortgage hedging 
uncertainty with respect to the time it takes to close mortgage loans can lead to unpredictable revenue and profitability 
the time between the date an application for a mortgage loan is received from a customer and the date the loan closes can be lengthy and unpredictable 
the loan application and approval process is often delayed due to factors over which we have little or no control  including the timing of the customer s decision to commit to an available interest rate  the close of escrow date for purchase loans  the timeliness of appraisals and the adequacy of the customer s own disclosure documentation 
purchase mortgage loans generally take longer to close than refinance loans as they are tied to the close of the property sale escrow date 
this uncertain timetable can have a direct impact on our revenue and profitability for any given period 
we may expend substantial funds and resources supporting the loan fulfillment process and never generate revenue from closed loans 
therefore  our results of operations for a particular period may be adversely affected if the mortgage loans applied for during that period do not close in a timely manner or at all 
the increasing number of federal  state and local anti predatory lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans  or increase our risk of liability or cost of doing business 
the enactment of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations intended to eliminate so called predatory lending practices impose restrictions on loans on which certain points and fees or the annual percentage rate apr exceed specified thresholds 
our mortgage loan purchasers and warehouse lenders are willing to buy or finance only a very limited selection of such loans  and these loans are subject to greater risks for actual or perceived non compliance with such laws  rules and regulations  including demands for indemnification or loan repurchases from our loan purchasers  class action lawsuits  increased defenses to foreclosure of individual loans in default  individual claims for monetary damages  and administrative enforcement actions 
the continued enactment of these laws  rules and regulations may prevent us from making certain loans and may cause us to reduce the apr or the points and fees on loans that we do make 
in addition  the difficulty of managing the risks presented by these laws  rules and regulations may decrease the availability of warehouse financing and the overall demand for certain subprime loans  making it difficult to fund or sell such loans 
the growing number of these laws  rules and regulations may increase our cost of doing business  as we are required to develop systems and procedures to ensure that we do not violate any aspect of these new requirements 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have recently experienced significant growth in our business  and if we are unable to manage this growth  our business will be adversely affected 
over the past two years we have experienced significant growth  which has placed a strain on our resources and will continue to do so in the future 
our failure to manage this growth effectively could adversely affect our business 
we may not be successful in managing or expanding our operations or maintaining adequate management  financial and operating systems and controls 
our headcount has grown substantially 
at december  and  we had and full time employees including temporary and contract employees  respectively 
our future success is dependent upon increased acceptance of the internet by consumers and lenders as a medium for lending 
our success will depend in large part on widespread consumer acceptance of obtaining mortgage and auto loans online 
increased consumer use of the internet to provide for their lending needs is subject to uncertainty 
the development of an online market for mortgage and auto loans has only recently begun  is rapidly evolving and likely will be characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
if consumer acceptance of the internet as a source for mortgage  home equity and auto loans does not increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
a number of factors may inhibit internet usage by consumers  including privacy and security concerns regarding their personal information 
the adoption of online lending requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and applying for credit by consumers that have historically relied upon traditional lending methods 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete effectively with traditional borrowing and lending methods 
the termination of one or more of our mortgage funding sources would adversely affect our business 
we depend on gmac mortgage corporation  formerly gmac bank gmac mortgage  greenwich capital financial products  inc greenwich capital and merrill lynch mortgage capital inc merrill lynch to finance our mortgage loan activities through the warehouse credit facilities they provide 
if any of these warehouse credit facilities becomes unavailable  our business would be adversely affected 
under our agreements with each of these lenders  we make extensive representations  warranties and various operating and financial covenants 
a material breach of these representations  warranties or covenants on any of our lines could result in the termination of our agreements and an obligation to repay all amounts outstanding at the time of termination 
in the past  we have had to obtain waivers from our warehouse lenders as a result of our failure to comply with covenants regarding the issuance of capital stock  excess asset purchases and our failure to meet financial ratios 
more recently  we obtained a waiver from one of our warehouse lenders due to a failure to meet a current ratio covenant for the months ended april and may  our agreement with greenwich capital expires on march   our agreement with gmac mortgage expires on march  and our agreement with merrill lynch expires on february  upon expiration of these agreements  management believes it will either renew its existing warehouse credit facilities or obtain sufficient additional credit facilities 
however  we cannot assure that these agreements will be renewed or extended past their current expiration dates  and additional sources of funding for our mortgage loans may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
the termination of our auto line of credit would adversely affect our business 
we have obtained a line of credit from merrill lynch mortgage capital inc to finance the funding of our auto loans  and this is our sole facility for auto loan fundings 
if this credit facility becomes unavailable  our business could be adversely affected 
under our line of credit agreement  we make extensive representations  warranties and various operating and financial covenants 
a material breach of these representations  warranties or covenants could result in the termination of the facility and an obligation to repay all amounts outstanding at the time of termination 
in the past we have had to obtain waivers from our previous auto line of credit provider bank one  na as a result of our failure to comply with a covenant regarding a debt to tangible net worth ratio 
our line of credit with merrill lynch mortgage capital inc expires july  upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing line or obtain sufficient additional lines 
however  we cannot assure you that this agreement will be renewed or extended past its current expiration date  and additional sources of funding for our auto loans may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we are primarily dependent on two loan purchasers for all of our home equity business 
for the year ended december   the majority of our home equity loans were purchased by wells fargo bank and the provident bank pursuant to home equity loan line purchase agreements 
if either loan purchaser is unable or unwilling to purchase our home equity loans  we may experience delays in our ability to accept or process home equity loan applications until we are able to secure new sources of loan purchasers 
sufficient additional sources of loan purchasers for our home equity loans may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we are dependent on one loan purchaser for all of our auto loan business 
we currently sell all of our prime auto loans to e loan auto fund one  llc  a qualified special purpose entity qspe 
the qspe is dependent on merrill lynch bank usa to provide the necessary financing to continue purchasing loans from us 
if merrill lynch bank usa is unable or unwilling to provide continuing financing to the qspe  additional forms of financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we depend on the timely and competent services of various companies involved in the mortgage process  if these companies fail to timely and competently deliver these services  our business and reputation will be directly and adversely affected 
we rely on other companies to perform services related to the loan underwriting process  including appraisals  credit reporting and title searches 
any interruptions or delays in the provision of these services may cause delays in the processing and closing of loans for our customers 
if we are unsuccessful in managing the timely delivery of these services we will likely experience increased customer dissatisfaction and our business and reputation could be adversely affected 
the loss of our relationship with any of our significant providers of automated underwriting would have an adverse effect on our business 
we depend on automated underwriting and other services offered by government sponsored and other mortgage investors  including fannie mae and freddie mac agencies  to help ensure that our mortgage services can be offered efficiently and on a timely basis 
we currently have an agreement with the agencies that authorizes our use of their automated underwriting services and enables us to sell qualified first mortgages to these agencies 
we cannot assure that we will remain in good standing with the agencies or that the agencies will not terminate our relationship 
we expect to continue to process a significant portion of our conforming mortgage loans using the agencies systems 
our agreement with the agencies can be terminated by either party 
the termination of our agreements with the agencies would adversely affect our business by reducing our ability to streamline the mortgage origination process 
any outages  delays or other difficulties experienced internally or through internet service providers  online service providers or other website operators on which our users depend could adversely affect our business 
due to the complexities of providing effective and responsive internet based products and services to customers  our information technology business model could experience delays and outages caused by a number of factors 
our it platform is an integration of complex technologies ranging from proprietary and open source technologies to commercially available licensed technologies from industry leaders such as cisco systems  sun microsystems and oracle 
although our it business systems are designed to minimize downtime in the normal course of business  we cannot assure our service levels can be maintained in all possible disaster scenarios 
moreover  our users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other website operators for access to our website 
many internet users have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to component or system failures unrelated to our systems 
any of these problems could adversely affect our business 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers financial data 
internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurred 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches that occur 
we also retain on our premises personal financial documents we receive from prospective borrowers in connection with their loan applications 
these documents are highly sensitive and if a third party were to misappropriate our customers personal information  customers could possibly bring legal claims against us 
we cannot assure that our privacy policy will be deemed sufficient by our prospective customers or compliant with any federal or state laws governing privacy  which may be adopted in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate movements significantly impact our volume of closed loans and represent the primary component of market risk to us 
in a higher interest rate environment  consumer demand for mortgage loans  particularly refinancing of existing mortgages  declines 
interest rate movements affect the interest income earned on loans held for sale  interest expense on the warehouse lines payable  the value of mortgage loans held for sale and ultimately the gain on sale of mortgage and auto loans 
we attempt to minimize the interest rate risk associated with the time lag between when fixed rate mortgage loans are rate locked and when they are committed for sale or exchanged in the secondary market  through our hedging activities 
individual mortgage loan risks are aggregated by loan type and stage in the pipeline  and are then matched  based on duration  with the appropriate hedging instrument  thus mitigating basis risk until closing and delivery 
we currently hedge our mortgage pipeline through mandatory forward sales of fannie mae mortgage backed securities in addition to both mandatory and best efforts forward loan sale agreements with the ultimate investor 
we determine which alternative provides the best execution in the secondary market 
in addition  we do not believe our net interest income would be materially affected as a result of concurrent changes in long term and short term interest rates due to the short duration of time loans are held on the balance sheet prior to being sold approximately thirty days 
we manage our interest rate exposure related to auto loan approvals by entering into amortizing swap contracts 
we believe that we have implemented a cost effective hedging program to provide a high level of protection against changes in the market value of rate lock commitments 
however  an effective strategy is complex and no hedging strategy can completely insulate the company against such changes
