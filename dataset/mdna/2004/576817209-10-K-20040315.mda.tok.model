item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors in this annual report 
the historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future results 
executive overview we provide comprehensive  integrated disease management services and related products that offer cost saving solutions for many of the most costly medical conditions and chronic diseases  including diabetes  cardiovascular diseases  respiratory disorders  obstetrical conditions  cancer  depression  chronic pain and hepatitis c 
we emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to care that involves our clinicians working with physicians to oversee the adherence to treatment plans 
we focus on the management of patients between visits to their physician  the improvement of the patient s compliance with the physician s care plan and the avoidance of controllable and costly events  such as emergency room visits and hospital admissions 
we have invested heavily in disease management information technology  call c enter infrastructure  a national network of skilled multidisciplinary clinicians and supply distribution channels to serve this critical aspect of patient care 
we have two reportable business segments health enhancement and women s health 
health enhancement 
our health enhancement segment provides disease management programs and related pharmacy  laboratory and supplies services 
the disease management services target patients with chronic diseases or other high cost medical conditions  those at risk of developing such a health problem and the emerging pharmaceutical market in support of complex drug therapies 
in addition  the segment offers diabetes disease management services and supplies in germany and includes facet technologies  a leading designer  developer  assembler and distributor of products for the diabetes market 
facet serves large medical device manufacturers and distributors of blood glucose test kits and other point of care test kits  with an estimated to of the world market share in standard lancets  lancing devices and safety lancets used by diabetes patients to obtain blood samples for testing blood glucose levels 
women s health 
our women s health segment offers a wide range of clinical and disease management services designed to assist physicians and payors in the cost effective management of maternity patients 
in addition  we recently announced a strategic initiative to provide services for infants and children through neonatal intensive care case management and delivery of specialty pharmaceuticals 
our disease management customers include primarily fortune employers  health plans  medicare and medicaid programs  pharmaceutical companies and patients 
industry factors total healthcare spending in the united states is expected to exceed trillion in  with predictions that healthcare spending may further double by according to the centers for disease control  a majority of that spending is attributed to the more than million americans suffering from chronic diseases 
in particular  patients with chronic conditions account for of all home healthcare visits  of all prescriptions  of all in patient hospital stays and of all physician visits 
moreover  healthcare spending to treat chronic diseases is rapidly rising due to noncompliant patients  uninformed patients who select expensive drug therapies  lack of coordinated systems and protocols to track and follow up with high acuity patients and the inability of medical professionals to fully address the day to day challenges faced by their patient populations 
these tre nds are causing healthcare industry participants to focus on solutions that lower costs through improved patient health and outcomes 
employers are especially affected by these trends 
in addition to double digit increases in direct healthcare costs  employers are experiencing an increase in indirect costs associated with absenteeism and other lost employee productivity 
the national academy on aging has found that chronic diseases are now recognized as a major source of lost productivity  estimating that the total dollar loss from chronic conditions ranges from billion to billion annually 
employers are seeking solutions to the impact healthcare is having on their profit margins and the additional financial burden being placed on their employees through increased premiums  co pays  coinsurance and deductibles 
employers are more proactive in their management of healthcare costs and increasingly view disease management as a meaningful and effective tool to address their healthcare problems 
the medicare program has also been significantly affected by the rising costs of healthcare due to the general aging of the population and the increased prevalence of chronic and high cost conditions among the elderly 
studies have shown that a relatively small number of beneficiaries with certain chronic illnesses asthma  diabetes  congestive heart failure and related cardiac conditions  hypertension  coronary artery disease  cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions  and chronic lung disease account for a disproportionate share of medicare fee for service expenditures 
patients with these conditions typically receive fragmented care from providers at multiple sites  and require repeated hospitalization 
pursuant to recent medicare reform legislation  disease management demonstration programs will be established in ten regions of the country to test whether provi ding coordinated care services to medicare fee for service beneficiaries with complex chronic conditions can yield better clinical outcomes without increasing program costs 
the federal government has indicated that it will select private providers to implement the programs 
in addition  a number of states are pursuing disease management pilots in their medicaid programs 
recently  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  issued a release urging states to adopt disease management programs and announcing the availability of federal matching funding 
business strategy our goal is to further expand our position as a leading provider of disease management services 
we seek to achieve this goal by pursuing the following strategies capitalize on our position as an industry leader in the disease management market 
we believe our extensive experience  established infrastructure and list of existing customers provide us a significant competitive advantage as we seek to capitalize on the growing market for disease management 
we have more than years of experience in providing disease management and related services 
our established infrastructure includes our proprietary trax tm technology platform  call center operations located throughout the united states  supply distribution channels and a national network of skilled multi disciplinary clinicians 
leverage our trax tm technology 
we will continue to make significant investments in trax tm in order to better identify patients for intervention and improve treatment plans for these identified patients 
a major challenge of disease management programs is to link the design and monitoring of treatment plans with the actual clinical services and fulfillment of drugs and related supplies 
we believe that our trax tm technology platform is uniquely capable to address this issue and to coordinate both treatment objectives and treatment activities 
further penetrate all key segments of the growing disease management market 
we intend to expand our customer base within the employer  health plan  medicare  medicaid and pharmaceutical markets 
employers 
we have identified this sector as a prime customer target as employers seek to improve employee productivity by reducing absenteeism and other forms of lost productivity 
we have experienced a significant increase in demand for our disease management services among employer clients  having been awarded several new employer accounts since september regional and national health plans 
although health plans have been in the medical management business for several years  they increasingly are seeking disease management as an opportunity to minimize medical cost inflation 
medicare 
we expect to be in a position to bid on medicare disease management programs in the latter part of  emphasizing the breadth of our disease management programs and our trax tm technology platform in order to be selected as a provider for portions of this medicare business 
medicaid 
in august  we entered into an agreement with pfizer inc s health solutions group to provide disease management services to state medicaid programs under contract with pfizer 
although pfizer has not yet been awarded a contract that would require our services  we believe this alliance represents a significant market opportunity 
we intend to pursue participation in state programs encouraged by cms in its recent announcement 
pharmaceutical companies 
we recently implemented a contract with schering plough corp 
to provide disease management services for patients infected with the hepatitis c virus 
the program helps patients complete their individualized peg intron therapy regimen  providing their best chance for achieving sustained viral response 
continue to expand our service offering 
we believe that the ability to offer customers an integrated  health enhancement solution of services across multiple chronic medical conditions is an increasingly important competitive requirement 
we are continuously seeking to expand our product and service offerings 
for example  we entered the cancer disease management field by acquiring quality oncology in  and in we developed our depression and low back pain management programs and expanded our case management services through the acquisition of options unlimited 
cross selling within our company 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our disease management business by cross selling other products and services to existing customers as they realize the cost savings and better patient outcomes that our programs provide 
our disease management programs included million covered lives as of december  compared with million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced our plans to initiate disease management programs with a number of employers and health plans prior to the end of the first quarter of in addition  the pipeline of employer and health plan accounts in various stages of discussions is more than double the prior year 
while the magnitude of growth in new accounts provides us with challenges  we have an established framework for assisting employers and health plans in managing and integrating their disease management programs 
we have expansion capacity in our call centers and have continued the rapid development of our trax tm technology platform and capabilities for the disease management processes and related connectivity and integration 
we do not foresee any abnormal pricing pressure relative to our disease management programs over the next year 
medical statistics indicate that one in eight births is preterm  with that number on the rise 
preterm delivery is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and birth related morbidity and results in significantly higher cost than full term pregnancies 
our women s health segment s services have proven effective in extending pregnancy and reducing costs 
however  the reimbursement rates have been decreasing for such services  and patient access to services that manage high risk pregnancies has been reduced 
acquisitions and expansion of services we recently announced a strategic initiative to provide services for infants and children through neonatal intensive care case management and delivery of specialty pharmaceuticals 
in connection with this initiative  we are changing the name of our women s health segment to women s and children s health in in august  our women s health segment expanded its service offering to include p administration service for women at risk for recurrent preterm delivery 
p  a drug therapy that may prolong pregnancy  is being increasingly prescribed by physicians 
in august  we entered into an agreement with pfizer  inc s health solutions group to provide disease management services to state medicaid programs under contract with pfizer 
although pfizer has not yet been awarded a contract that would require our services  we believe this alliance represents a significant opportunity 
effective october   we purchased certain assets of options unlimited comprehensive rehabilitative services  inc  options unlimited  a healthcare and disability management firm specializing in case and utilization management for health plans  third party administrators and employers 
we are integrating options unlimited s case and utilization management services with our existing disease management services and offering these services to health plans and employers

our financial statements include the operations of matria labs effective february  and those of marketring commencing on june  on september   we completed our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of quality oncology  inc  or qo  a national provider of cancer disease management programs  from lifemetrix  inc  or lifemetrix 
this acquisition broadened our capability to offer health plans and employers a single source for multiple disease management services 
in this acquisition  we also acquired from lifemetrix its integrated care management system and its rights in cancerpage 
com and other assets related to its cancer disease management business 
results of operations of qo were reflected in our financial statements effective october  in april  we introduced our cardiovascular disease management program  which includes the management of patients afflicted with coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure 
in november  we added disease management programs for depression and chronic pain to our service offerings

the decision to terminate the program  which utilized split dollar life insurance as the funding mechanism  was prompted in part by concerns that such a vehicle may no longer be permitted for some current officers under certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as anticipation that additional funding  in excess of amounts originally contemplated  would have been required under the former plan

sales to patients covered by medicare constitute less than of our total revenues in for a discussion of other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  see risk factors in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and short term investments of million 
net cash provided by continuing operations decreased from million in to million in the improvement from earnings from continuing operations was more than offset by fluctuations in working capital components  primarily increases in accounts receivable and reduced increases in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities  somewhat offset by a reduced increase in inventory levels compared to the prior year

on september   we acquired qo for initial consideration of approximately million  consisting of million in cash and approximately  shares of common stock 
the common stock is reflected on our balance sheet at a price of per share 
the price is the day average of the closing stock prices between june and june   based on a measurement date of june  which was the date that the closing stock price fell below the minimum price in the purchase and sale agreement and the number of shares became fixed 
an additional  shares were issued in february pursuant to a purchase price adjustment 
additional consideration will be paid in based upon qo s operating results 
management currently estimates that the additional consideration will be approximately million 
however  the final amount may be adjusted based on results of a final audit and resolution 
the additional consideration will be payable  at our option  in cash  common stock or a combination thereof  provided that the lesser of of the payment or million must be paid in cash 
while management has the option to issue common stock and will continue to evaluate its payment alternatives  management currently intends to pay the contingent consideration in cash

matria s chairman and chief executive officer and four other directors of matria were stockholders of marketring

our senior notes are unsecured and will mature on may  interest is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november among the covenants under the bond indenture is a requirement to offer to repurchase notes from our annual excess cash flow  as defined  or from the proceeds received from the sale of assets 
in august  we repurchased in the open market million principal amount of outstanding senior notes  leaving million outstanding under our senior notes as of december  such repurchases in the open market are permitted under the bond indenture and may be applied to reduce the amount required to be repurchased  at of the principal amount  under the annual excess cash flow repurchase covenant 
the august repurchase fully satisfi ed the excess cash flow repurchase covenant for the annual excess cash flow repurchase covenant required no repurchases in and  and no principal was otherwise repaid 
we are bound by a number of covenants set forth in our senior notes indenture 
negative covenants in such instruments limit our ability to  among other things  incur indebtedness and liens  pay dividends  repurchase shares  enter into merger agreements  make investments  engage in new business activities unrelated to our current business or sell assets 
in july  from the proceeds of the senior notes  we completed the repurchase of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock  retired one million common stock warrants and repaid all amounts outstanding under our former bank credit facilities and subordinated acquisition notes 
the resulting net gain of  was included in net earnings available to common shareholders in in september  we terminated our then existing revolving bank credit facility 
in october  we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable 
the facility is collateralized by cash  accounts receivable  inventories  intellectual property and certain other of our assets 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at the libor rate plus  and the facility requires a non utilization fee of of the unused borrowing capacity 
interest and the commitment fee are payable monthly 
the facility is effective until october thereafter  the term will be automatically extended for annual successive periods unless either party provides notice to the contrary not less than days prior to the end of the period 
as of december   million was outstanding and millio n was available for borrowing under this credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain certain financial ratios

proceeds were received from participants under our stock purchase and stock option plans totaling  million and million in  and  respectively 
other factors affecting liquidity the following sets forth our future minimum payments required under contractual obligations as of december  payments due by year amounts in thousands total thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations acquisition obligation 

total as described above  we have the option to pay a portion of this obligation in common stock 
capital expenditures of approximately million are estimated in as we continue to enhance our computer information systems 
interest payments of million under our senior note will be payable in effective march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank involving million of our senior notes  which mature in under this arrangement  the bank would pay us an fixed rate of interest semi annually in arrears on may and november we would pay the bank semi annually in arrears on may and november a variable rate of interest based on the six month libor rate plus determined at the end of the period 
the variable rate at december  of reflects a rate reduction of 
effective august   we entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with the same bank for an additional million of the our senior notes with terms as described above  except that the variable rate of interest for this second agreement is based on the six month libor rate plus also determined at the end of the period 
the variable rate at december  of reflects a rate reduction of 
both transactions were considered to be hedges against changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligation and are used to lower our overall borrowing rates 
in january  both interest rate swaps were terminated  resulting in a net balance of approximately  which will be amortized into income as an increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes through may 
after the swaps were terminated in january  we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with the bank with a notional amount of million 
under this arrangement  the bank will pay us an fixed rate of interest semi annually in arrears on may and november we will pay the bank semi annually in arrears on may and november a variable rate of interest based on the six month libor rate plus determined at the end of the period 
under the swap agreements  we are required to maintain cash collateral with the bank 
the collateral requirement is determined based on an initial base amount of million  and varies based on fluctuations in market exposure 
as of december   the collateral totaled million 
we believe that our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows and revolving credit facility  taken together  will provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  planned capital expenditures and contractual obligations through at least on october   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the commission relating to million of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares  warrants and units 
the registration statement became effective on october  we may publicly offer these securities from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of the relevant offerings 
we believe that the shelf registration statement will assist in providing us with flexibility in raising debt and or equity financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any sale of additional equity or convertible securities covered by the registration statement could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
critical accounting estimates a critical accounting estimate meets two criteria it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters  and there would be a material effect on the financial statements from either using a different  also reasonable  amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period to period changes in the estimate 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
revenues for our women s health segment are generated by providing services through patient service centers 
revenues from this segment are recognized as the related services are rendered and are net of contractual allowances and related discounts 
our health enhancement segment provides services through its patient service centers  provides supplies to patients primarily on a mail order basis  and designs  develops  assembles  packages and distributes diabetes products 
revenues for services are recognized when services are provided  and revenues from product sales are recognized when products are shipped 
revenues from this segment are recorded net of contractual allowances and other discounts 
our clinical services and our supply business are reimbursed on a fee for service or per item basis 
other aspects of disease management  however  are paid for primarily on the basis of i monthly fees for each employee or member enrolled in a health plan  ii each member identified with a particular chronic disease or condition under contract  iii each member enrolled in our program or iv a fixed rate per case 
billings for certain services occur in advance of services being performed 
such amounts are recorded as unearned revenue in the balance sheet and revenue is recognized as services are performed 
some of the contracts for these services provide that a portion of our fees is at risk subject to our performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
thus  a portion of our revenues are subject to confirmation of our the terms of these contracts and other fa ctors affecting revenue recognition are accrued in the period the services are provided and adjusted in future periods when final settlement is determined 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as information related to performance levels and associated fees become available 
these reviews and adjustments have not resulted in a material reduction in any recent period of revenue previously reported 
for  less than of our revenues were at risk under these arrangements 
a significant portion of our revenues is billed to third party reimbursement sources 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of our trade accounts receivable is susceptible to changes in third party reimbursement policies 
in addition  the collectibility of all of our accounts receivable varies based on payor mix  general economic conditions and other factors 
a provision for doubtful accounts is made for revenues estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based upon our evaluation of current industry conditions  historical collection experience  recoveries of amounts previously provided  industry reimbursement trends  audit activity and other relevant factors which  in the opinion of management  deserve recognition in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the evaluation is performed at each reporting period for each operati ng unit with an overall assessment at the consolidated level 
the evaluation of the monthly estimates of revenues estimated to be uncollectible has not resulted in material adjustments in any recent period  however  special charges have resulted from certain specific circumstances affecting collectibility 
while estimates and judgments are involved and factors impacting collectibility may change  management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts to be collected 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as of december   we reported goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at carrying amounts of million and million  respectively 
the total of million represents approximately of total assets as of december  our identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
our goodwill is no longer amortized to expense 
we review goodwill and identifiable intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  we calculate the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill and identifiable intangibles relate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
based on the evaluation  management concluded that no impairment of recorded goodwill and intangibles exists at december  the approach utilized is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
therefore  future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimates 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
additionally  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the income tax expense of million for reflected a higher expense than the statutory rate due to state income taxes  various non deductible permanent differences between tax and financial reporting and a higher foreign income tax rate 
the income tax benefit of million for reflected a lower benefit than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and various non deductible permanent differences between tax and financial reporting 
the tax provision recorded for was million 
cash outflows for income taxes in and totaled million and  respectively  being comprised of federal alternative minimum taxes  state and foreign taxes 
as of december   our remaining net operating losses of million  the tax effect of which is reflected on the balance sheet in the deferred tax asset  will be available to offset future taxable income 
based on projections of taxab le income in and future years  management believes that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the value of the recorded deferred income tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements which contain additional accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of the accounting estimates  and this disclosure  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables with respect to determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables 
the issue no 
consensus provides a framework for determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables based on a determination of whether the multiple deliverables qualify to be accounted for as separate units of accounting 
the consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  while we have revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the adoption of this consensus did not  nor is it expected to have  a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  finan cial position or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
both of those methods avoid the ramp up effect arising from prospective application of the fair value based method 
in addition  to address concerns raised by some constituents about the lack of comparability caused by multiple transition methods  sfas does not permit the use of the original sfas prospective method of transition for changes to the fair value based method made in fiscal years beginning after december  in addition  sfas amended the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
in the absence of a single accounting method for stock based employee compensation  sfas requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when  or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
sfas improves the prominence and clarity of the pro forma disclosures required by sfas by prescribing a specific tabular format and by requiring disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies 
in addition  sfas improves the timeliness of those disclosures by requiring their inclusion in financial reports for interi m periods 
we have elected not to adopt the fair value based method of accounting  and therefore provides the pro forma disclosures required by sfas and sfas our disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements contain all of the new disclosure requirements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we believe that we have no interests in variable interest entities that will require disclosure or consolidation under fin in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amended and clarified accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas amended sfas regarding implementation issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative  particularly regarding the meaning of an underlying and the characteristics of a derivative that contains financing components 
the amendments set forth in sfas improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
in particular  this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in sfas in addition  it clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of this statement did not have any significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement was developed in response to concerns expressed about issuers classification in the statement of financial position of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity  but that have been presented either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the balance sheet 
sfas will have no effect on the balance sheet presentation of our debt and equity financial instruments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk relates to our interest rate swap facilities  which are based on the six month libor rate 
two swaps with a combined notional amount of million were terminated in january after the swaps were terminated  we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with the bank with a notional amount of million 
under this arrangement  which matures in  the bank will pay us an fixed rate of interest 
we will pay the bank a variable rate of interest based on the six month libor rate plus 
based on the libor rate as of december   the rate would have been 
the annual benefit under the interest rate swap is estimated to be approximately million  based on the libor rate as of december  a hypothetical two percentage point increase in the libor rate for a duration of one year would result in additional inter est expense of approximately million 
our operations outside the united states  with sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily in germany  generated approximately of total revenues in the year ended december  in the normal course of business  these operations are exposed to fluctuations in currency values 
in addition  we have certain receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
we do not consider the impact of currency fluctuations to represent a significant risk and have chosen not to hedge its foreign currency exposure 
based on results of and balances as of december   a hypothetical change in the currency exchange rates would impact annual pre tax earnings by approximately
