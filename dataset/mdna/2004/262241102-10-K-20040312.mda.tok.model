com  inc 
is a leading provider of online health  beauty  wellness  personal care  vision and pharmacy solutions 
we believe that our web stores  including those located on the internet at www

com  offer a better way for consumers to shop for these products 
we operate primarily in the united states and canada  but our products are available to consumers worldwide 
business segments  growth strategies 
as a result of our acquisition of vision direct and our current growth strategies within our pharmacy product category  we have organized our business into four primary business segments mail order pharmacy  local pick up pharmacy  over the counter  or otc  and vision 
the organization of our business into these four distinct segments allows our management to gain a comprehensive financial view of each of our key businesses and our business as a whole 
in addition  this segmentation better allows us to align strategies in operations  marketing and customer care to optimize the overall customer experience  within each segment and across all segments  and maximize growth 
mail order pharmacy 
our mail order pharmacy segment includes prescription drugs and supplies  other than prescription contact lenses  that are ordered online or over the telephone at the www 
drugstore 
com web store and delivered to customers through our mail order facility 
we obtain our inventory through rite aid as part of our ongoing relationship 
we market to and serve cash paying and insurance covered individuals and also serve as an independent  online solution for low cost mail order prescription services 
we are currently a mail order prescription drug provider for seven pbms and intend to focus our marketing efforts on establishing broader relationships with those pbms and expanding our services to additional pbms 
in  we anticipate that our growth in this segment will substantially depend on our ability to grow prescription volumes through these efforts 

table of contents local pick up pharmacy 
our local pick up pharmacy business segment includes prescription refills ordered online or over the telephone at our www 
drugstore 
com web store and picked up by customers at rite aid stores 
in this segment  rite aid acts as our fulfillment partner 
our growth in this segment will depend on our ability to leverage our relationship with rite aid through marketing in in store rite aid receipts  weekly rite aid advertising circulars and email advertising 
in  we expect that local pick up pharmacy will be our slowest growing segment  as we focus the majority of our company wide marketing efforts on our higher margin otc and vision segments 
over the counter otc 
our otc segment also known as non pharmaceutical includes all non prescription products sold through our www 
drugstore 
com and www 
beauty 
com web stores and through our subsidiary cns at www 
drweilvitaminadvisor 
com  www 
zoneprofiler 
com and www 
pritikin home 
com 
we source our otc products from various manufacturers and distributors 
we believe that growth in this segment will depend on our ability to offer customers a superior shopping experience and service  including a broad selection of basic necessity items as well as hard to find specialty items  that incents them to return to our web sites and make repeat  replenishment and impulse purchases 
vision 
our vision segment was created as a result of our acquisition of vision direct in december the vision segment includes contact lenses and vision products sold by vision direct through its web sites located at www 
visiondirect 
com  www 
lensmart 
com and www 
lensquest 
com 
we purchase our contact lens and vision products inventory directly from various manufacturers and other distributors 
consumer demand for a wide variety of contact lenses  including daily wear  disposables  toric  and cosmetic lenses  is growing  and we believe that growth in this segment will depend on our ability to take advantage of this trend and to successfully integrate vision direct into our business 
we intend to grow sales in this segment by implementing an aggressive pricing and customer acquisition strategy 
revenues 
we generate revenue primarily from product sales and shipping fees 
in  we reported consolidated total net sales of million  which reflected a million  or  increase over improved performance in our otc business segment  in which net sales grew by million  or  in contributed substantially to our growth in total net sales for the year 
of this otc growth  million was organic growth  which we believe was aided by our ongoing customer loyalty programs  everyday free shipping  drugstore 
com dollars and diamond deals  and million was due to our acquisition of cns 
growth in our local pick up pharmacy segment also contributed significantly to our growth in total net sales 
net sales in this segment increased by million  or  in compared to over the course of the year  we saw the growth rate of this segment decline as we began to redirect and focus our marketing dollars on our higher margin otc business 
finally  our mail order pharmacy segment and our vision segment which was created in december contributed million and million  respectively  to the growth in our total net sales in assuming that we are able to successfully implement our growth strategies  successfully integrate vision direct and cns into our business and manage our expenses  among other things  we anticipate total net sales in in the range of million to million  up million to million from we expect our growth to benefit from a full year s net sales by vision direct and cns 
expenses 
our operating expenses  including cost of goods sold  declined as a percentage of net sales from in  to in this decline resulted from our efforts to reduce our cost of goods as a percentage of total net sales by increasing our mix of higher margin otc products relative to lower margin pharmacy products 
the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales was also due to increased efficiency in our marketing spending  which resulted in a decrease of  or  in our sales and marketing expenses per new customer acquired in compared to in addition  increased utilization of our primary distribution center reduced our fulfillment expenses to of total net sales in  down from in we also reduced technology expenses by million and held general and administrative and other operating expenses relatively flat in 
table of contents net loss  cash position 
the combination of our revenue growth and cost containment efforts resulted in a year over year decline in our net loss of  or million  to million in we ended with over million in cash and marketable securities and no debt 
uses of cash in included the expenditure of an aggregate of million in connection with the acquisitions of vision direct and cns 
assuming that we are able to implement our growth initiatives  increase sales and continue to reduce total expenses as a percentage of sales  we anticipate net losses in to decline to the range of million to million 
although we expect a net loss for  we do not expect our cash balance to decline significantly in because we anticipate that a substantial portion of our net loss will reflect non cash expenses  such as amortization and depreciation 
accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the significant accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  that involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
additional information about our significant accounting policies is included in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of products delivered to customers net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates and returns allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
products are considered shipped upon delivery to the common carrier  at which time both title and risk of loss are transferred as pursuant to our contracts with our carriers 
this arrangement is commonly referred to as fob shipping point 
return allowances  which reduce product sales by our best estimate of expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
if our estimate of return allowances is too high  our revenues will be understated  if our estimate of these allowances is too low  our revenues will be overstated 
product returns  and differences between our estimates and actual returns  have not been significant historically 
revenues from sales of certain pharmaceutical products ordered through our drugstore 
com web store for pick up at a rite aid store are recognized when the customer collects the product 
in these circumstances  we utilize rite aid as a fulfillment partner 
according to the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf  we record revenues in our local pick up pharmacy segment on a gross basis  because we believe we act as a principal  based on the fact that  among other things  we bear both credit risk and inventory risk associated with these sales 
periodically  we provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases 
such offers include discounts on specific current purchases  which we refer to as diamond deals  or future rebates based upon a percentage of the current purchase  which we refer to as drugstore 
com dollars  and similar offers 
diamond deals  when accepted by our customers  are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction and are presented as a net amount in net sales 
rebates we offer are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated redemption rates 
redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar offers 
historically  our redemption rates  which are adjusted quarterly  have not differed materially from our estimates 

table of contents inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reserve for shrinkage and slow moving  damaged and expired inventory  which is recorded as the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on management s assumptions about future demand for the products we offer and market conditions 
we use a variety of methods to reduce the quantity of slow moving inventory  including reducing sales prices on our web sites  negotiating returns to vendors  and liquidating inventory through third parties 
if our estimates of future product demand or our assumptions about market conditions are inaccurate  we will understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
historically  the market value of our inventory has not differed materially from our estimates 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangibles  we do not amortize goodwill but instead test for impairment at least annually 
we test for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the first phase of the test screens for impairment and the second phase if necessary measures for impairment 
the first phase is performed by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
if our estimates of revenue growth or future cash flows prove to be inaccurate  we may have a future impairment of goodwill

income taxes there has been no provision or benefit for income taxes for any period since inception due to our ongoing operating losses

eitf establishes additional disclosure requirements for each category of fas investments in a loss position 
effective for years ending after december   companies must disclose the aggregate amount of unrealized losses  and the aggregate related fair value of their investments with unrealized losses 
those investments are required to be segregated by those in a loss position for less than twelve months and those in a loss position for greater than twelve months 
additionally  certain qualitative disclosures should be made to clarify a circumstance whereby an investment s fair value that is below cost is not considered other than temporary
