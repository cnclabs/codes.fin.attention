item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follow are a combined presentation for great plains energy and consolidated kcp l  both registrants under this filing 
the discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the registrants during the periods presented 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
losses in prior periods related to the operations of rsae have been reclassified and are presented as discontinued operations due to the june disposition of rsae 
great plains energy great plains energy does not own or operate any significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries 
great plains energy s direct subsidiaries are kcp l  klt inc  gpp  iec and gpes 
effective october   great plains energy became the holding company of kcp l  gpp and klt inc in november  the company created a wholly owned subsidiary  iec  as an intermediate holding company that holds an indirect interest in strategic energy 
gpes was formed in to provide services at cost to great plains energy and certain of its subsidiaries  including consolidated kcp l  as a service company under the act 
great plains energy business overview as a diversified energy company  great plains energy s reportable business segments include o kcp l  an integrated  regulated electric utility in the states of missouri and kansas  which provides reliable  affordable electricity to retail customers  o strategic energy  which provides retail electricity services by entering into long term contracts with its customers to supply electricity  operates in several electricity markets offering retail choice  including california  massachusetts  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas  and o klt gas  which explores for  develops and produces unconventional natural gas resources 
in february  the great plains energy board of directors approved management s recommendation to sell the klt gas portfolio and exit the gas business 
the company evaluated this business and determined the amount of capital and the length of time required for development of reserves and production combined with the earnings volatility of the exploration process are no longer compatible with the company s strategic vision 
over the first six months of  the company is engaging in a comprehensive strategic planning process to map its view of the future of the electric industry  and ultimately the company  over the next five to ten years 
this inclusive process draws on the creativity and skills of employees  outside experts and people from the community 
the strategic planning process will seek to enhance the disciplined growth of the company and build upon the strong foundation of kcp l and strategic energy 
this platform for growth provides a balanced mix of regulated earnings from the utility operations of kcp l and the potential continued growth of strategic energy as it expands its presence in competitive retail markets 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition 
pensions the company incurs significant costs in providing non contributory defined pension benefits 
the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 
pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plan  earnings on plan assets and plan amendments 
in addition  pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
these assumptions are updated annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  however  changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement 
the company generally recognizes gains and losses by amortizing over a five year period the rolling five year average of unamortized gains and losses 
the key assumptions used in developing the pension disclosures include a discount rate  a expected return on plan assets and a average compensation rate increase 
the discount rate was reduced by and from and  respectively  due to current market conditions  while the return on plan assets remained constant and the compensation rate decreased from prior years 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  fixed income security yield rates for year treasury bonds and corporate high grade bond yields were considered 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted average of the long term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a percent increase or a percent decrease in key actuarial assumptions 
each sensitivity reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption only 
impact on impact on projected impact on change in benefit pension pension actuarial assumption assumption obligation liability expense millions discount rate increase rate of return on plan assets increase discount rate decrease rate of return on plan assets decrease for the year ended december   the company recorded million of pension expense  an million increase from the previous year 
pension expense for is expected to approximate million  a million increase over the increase is primarily due to lower discount rates and the amortization of investment losses from prior years that are recognized on a rolling five year average basis 
the company s pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
the market value of the plan assets increased million in primarily reflecting an overall improvement in the equity markets during the year 
however  the increase was not enough to recover from significant market declines incurred in and when plan assets lost value of approximately million 
at plan year end  the fair value of pension plan assets was million  not including a million contribution made after the plan year end 
the total accumulated benefit obligation abo of the plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets requiring the company to record an additional minimum pension liability of million as prescribed by sfas no 
this was offset by an intangible asset of million to the extent of prior service costs  with the remainder of million charged to common equity through other comprehensive income oci 
accumulated oci  net of deferred taxes  was million 
oci could be restored through common equity in future periods to the extent fair value of trust assets exceeded the abo 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan 
it is difficult to predict future pension costs  the additional pension liability and cash funding requirements due to volatile market conditions  however  similar charges may be required in the future 
regulatory matters as a regulated utility  kcp l is subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  kcp l has recorded assets and liabilities on its balance sheet resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not be recorded under gaap if kcp l were not regulated 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
at december   kcp l s regulatory assets and liabilities totaled million and million  respectively 
kcp l s continued ability to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
may be affected in the future by competitive forces and restructuring in the electric industry 
in the event that sfas no 
no longer applied to all  or a separable portion  of kcp l s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
additionally  these factors could result in an impairment of utility plant assets if the cost of the assets could not be expected to be recovered in customer rates 
whether an asset has been impaired is determined pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities 
at the end of january  a severe ice storm occurred throughout large portions of the midwest  including the greater kansas city metropolitan area 
in  the kcc approved a stipulation and agreement regarding the treatment of the kansas portion of the ice storm costs 
pursuant to the stipulation and agreement  kcp l implemented a retail rate reduction january   and began calculating depreciation expense on wolf creek using a year life instead of a year life 
as a result of the stipulation and agreement  kcp l s retail revenues decreased approximately million and depreciation expense decreased approximately million 
the reduction in depreciation expense has been recorded as a regulatory asset 
kcp l also agreed to file a rate case by may  in  the mpsc approved kcp l s application for an accounting authority order related to the missouri jurisdictional portion of the storm costs 
the order allows kcp l to defer and amortize million  representing the missouri portion of the storm costs  through january the amortization  which began in september  is approximately million annually for the remainder of the amortization period 
asset retirement obligations effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which provides accounting requirements for the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
under the standard  these liabilities are recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset 
accretion of the liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense 
retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of sfas no 
are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws  statutes  written or oral contracts  including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
the adoption of sfas no 
changed the accounting for and the method used to report kcp l s obligation to decommission its share of wolf creek 
the legal obligation to decommission wolf creek was incurred when the plant was placed in service in the estimated liability  recognized on kcp l s balance sheet at january   is based on a third party nuclear decommissioning study conducted in kcp l used a credit adjusted risk free discount rate of to calculate the retirement obligation 
this estimated rate is based on the rate kcp l could issue year bonds  adjusted downward to reflect the portion of the anticipated costs in current year dollars that had been funded at date of adoption through a tax qualified trust fund 
the cumulative impact of prior decommissioning accruals recorded consistent with rate orders issued by the mpsc and kcc has been reversed and a new regulatory contra asset for such amounts has been established 
amounts collected through these rate orders have been deposited in a legally restricted external trust fund 
the fair market value of the trust fund was million at december  kcp l also must recognize  where possible to estimate  the future costs to settle other legal liabilities including the removal of water intake structures on rivers  capping filling of piping at levees following steam power plant closures and capping closure of ash landfills 
estimates for these liabilities are based on internal engineering estimates of third party costs to remove the assets in satisfaction of legal obligations and have been discounted using credit adjusted risk free rates ranging from to depending on the anticipated settlement date 
klt gas has estimated liabilities for gas well plugging and abandonment  facility removal and surface restoration 
these estimates are based upon internal estimates of third party costs to satisfy the legal obligations and have been discounted using credit adjusted risk free rates ranging from to  depending upon the anticipated settlement date 
revisions to the estimated liabilities of kcp l and klt gas could occur due to changes in the decommissioning or other cost estimates  extension of the nuclear operating license or changes in federal or state regulatory requirements 
on january   kcp l recorded asset retirement obligations aro of million and increased property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  by million 
kcp l is a regulated utility subject to the provisions of sfas no 
and management believes it is probable that any differences between expenses under sfas no 
and expenses recovered currently in rates will be recoverable in future rates 
as a result  the million net cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas no 
was recorded as a regulatory asset and therefore  had no impact on net income 
as a result of its adoption of sfas no 
 klt gas recorded aro of million  increased property and equipment by million and increased operating expense by million for the immaterial cumulative effect of the accounting change 
kcp l has legal aro for certain other assets where it is not possible to estimate the time period when the obligations will be settled 
consequently  the retirement obligations cannot be measured at this time 
for transmission easements obtained by condemnation  kcp l must remove its transmission lines if the line is de energized 
it is extremely difficult to obtain siting for new transmission lines 
consequently  kcp l does not anticipate de energizing any of its existing lines 
kcp l also operates  under state permits  ash landfills at several of its power plants 
while the life of the ash landfill at one plant can be estimated and is included in the estimated liabilities above  the future life of ash landfills at other permitted landfills cannot be estimated 
kcp l can continue to maintain permits for these landfills after the adjacent plant is closed 
although the liability for wolf creek decommissioning costs recorded under the aro method is expected to be substantially the same at the end of wolf creek s life as the liability to be recorded pursuant to regulatory orders the rate at which the liability increases varies under the different methods 
because kcp l is subject to sfas no 
 the difference in the recognition of the liability will have no impact on earnings 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 klt gas did not record separate asset retirement costs and liabilities  or the associated depreciation and accretion 
under the full cost method of accounting followed by klt gas  estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values  were recorded to the property cost to be amortized 
under sfas no 
 klt gas reserve for depreciation and asset retirement liabilities will increase systematically over the asset life up to the time of settlement with corresponding charges to expense 
it is anticipated the company s february decision to exit the gas business will be accomplished by the sale of klt gas assets 
management expects the aro related to the klt gas portfolio to be transferred to the new owners at the time of the sale 
asset impairment  including goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas no 
during  klt gas management determined that two gas properties were impaired as development activities indicated a decline in the estimates of future gas production 
as a result of the lower estimated production  the carrying amount of each property exceeded its estimated fair value based upon discounted estimated future cash flows  which resulted in impairments on the two properties 
internal and third party models were used to estimate future production volumes  natural gas pricing  capital expenditures and operating costs 
cash flow models were based on management s current understanding of prospect geology  well costs and projected operating expenses 
natural gas pricing assumptions were based on the new york mercantile exchange henry hub natural gas forward curve  adjusted for basis differentials and other transportation charges 
the impairments totaled million and were recorded as losses in gain loss on property in great plains energy s consolidated statement of income and the related million tax effects were recorded as reductions to income taxes resulting in a million reduction to earnings in additionally  in the second half of  great plains energy management performed a strategic review of the klt gas natural gas properties klt gas portfolio and operations 
at the direction of the board of directors  management engaged a third party specialist to help evaluate the klt gas business and provide recommendations regarding business strategy  management  staffing and optimization of the klt gas portfolio 
the objective of the strategic review was to develop a course of action regarding klt gas operations for the board of directors consideration at its february meeting 
after completion of the klt gas strategic review  management determined it would recommend a sale of the klt gas portfolio and a plan to exit the gas business at the february board of directors meeting 
as a result of its decision to recommend a sale of the klt gas portfolio and exit the gas business  great plains energy management engaged a second third party specialist to complete a market reference valuation analysis of the klt gas portfolio 
as a result of the klt gas strategic review and market reference valuation analysis having been conducted  an impairment test of the entire klt gas portfolio was performed at december   in accordance with sfas no 
 using a probability weighting of the likelihood of potential outcomes at the february meeting 
the impairment test considered the scenario of sale of the entire klt gas portfolio with fair value determined by a third party valuation specialist based on estimated market prices and the scenario of hold and use with fair value determined by risk adjusted discounted cash flows 
the impairment test indicated that the carrying amount of the klt gas portfolio exceeded the probability weighted fair value  which resulted in an impairment of million 
net of the related tax effect of million  the impairment reduced earnings by million 
the accounting estimates related to asset impairments of klt gas are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions about future natural gas production volumes  natural gas pricing  capital expenditure requirements  operating costs and risk adjusted discount rates 
further  the estimates at december   were impacted by management s assessment of the probability of potential outcomes related to selling or continuing to develop the klt gas portfolio 
as a result of the decision in the first quarter of to exit the gas business  the carrying amount of the klt gas portfolio will be written down to its estimated realizable value in the first quarter of sfas no 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist as prescribed under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be compared with its carrying value to determine the amount of impairment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of adopting sfas no 
on goodwill and goodwill amortization 
strategic energy s annual impairment test was completed as of september  the annual review date  and there was no impairment of the strategic energy goodwill 
at december  and  the unamortized balance of strategic energy goodwill on great plains energy s balance sheet was million 
rsae s goodwill was reviewed for impairment as of january   as required under the implementation provisions of sfas no 
based upon the results of a third party study and budgeted revenue  rsae recorded a million impairment of goodwill 
the impairment was reflected as a cumulative effect to january   of a change in accounting principle 
management believes that the accounting estimates related to impairment analyses required under sfas no 
are critical accounting estimates 
the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about future sales  operating costs and discount rates over an indefinite life 
historically  actual margins and volumes have fluctuated and  to a great extent  fluctuations are expected to continue 
the estimates of future margins are based upon internal budgets  which incorporate estimates of customer growth  business expansion and weather trends  among other items 
strategic energy energy and energy related contract accounting strategic energy primarily purchases power under long term forward physical delivery contracts to supply electricity to its retail energy customers under full requirement sales contracts 
both the forward purchase contracts and the full requirements sales contracts meet the accounting definition of a derivative  however  on a majority of the forward purchase derivative contracts and all of the full requirement sales contracts  strategic energy applies the normal purchase normal sale accounting treatment 
accordingly  strategic energy records receivables and revenues generated from the sales contracts as energy is delivered and consumed by the retail customer 
likewise  a liability and purchase power expense are recorded when the energy under long term forward physical delivery contracts is delivered to strategic energy s retail customers 
an inability to sustain the normal purchase normal sale accounting treatment for forward purchase derivative contracts could result in asymmetrical accounting  whereby the timing of the impact on operating earnings would differ if normal purchase normal sale accounting treatment was applied to the full requirements sales contracts  but the forward purchase derivative contracts no longer qualified for normal purchase normal sale accounting treatment 
for forward purchase contracts that do not meet the qualifying criteria for normal purchase normal sale accounting treatment  the company elects cash flow hedge accounting  where appropriate 
under cash flow hedge accounting  the fair value of the contract is recorded as a current or long term derivative asset or liability 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities are recorded on a net basis in oci and subsequently reclassified as purchased power expense in great plains energy s consolidated statement of income as the power is delivered and or the contract settles 
additionally  in the future oci may have greater fluctuations than historically because of a larger number of derivative contracts designated for cash flow hedge accounting  but these fluctuations would not affect current period earnings or cash flows 
changes in fair value of forward purchase derivative contracts that do not meet the requirements for the normal purchase normal sale accounting treatment or cash flow hedge accounting are recorded in earnings and as a current or long term derivative asset or liability 
the subsequent changes in the fair value of these contracts could result in earnings volatility as the fair value of the changes in the associated derivative assets and liabilities are recorded on a net basis in purchased power expense in great plains energy s consolidated statement of income 
derivative assets and liabilities consist of a combination of energy and energy related contracts 
while some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
the market prices and quantities used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimate considering various factors 
however  future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording energy assets and liabilities at fair value  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
market prices for energy and energy related commodities vary based upon a number of factors 
changes in market prices will affect the recorded fair value of energy contracts 
changes in the fair value of energy contracts will affect earnings in the period of the change for contracts under fair value accounting and oci in the period of changed for contracts under cash flow hedge accounting  while changes in forward market prices related to contracts under accrual accounting will affect earnings in future periods to the extent those prices are realized 
strategic energy cannot predict whether  or to what extent  the factors affecting market prices may change  but those changes could be material and could be either favorable or unfavorable

as of december   various defendants have settled with kcp l in this litigation  resulting in kcp l recording million under the terms of the subrogation allocation agreement 
the amount recorded in earnings related to the loss of use of the plant was approximately million million net of income taxes 
the effect was to increase wholesale revenues million  decrease fuel expense million and decrease purchased power expense million 
the remaining million was recorded as a recovery of capital expenditures 
consolidated kcp l s income from continuing operations increased million in compared to kcp l s revenue increased million primarily due to a significant increase in wholesale mwhs sold at higher wholesale prices partially offset by the effect on retail revenues of the january kansas rate reduction 
revenues also increased due to the partial settlements of hawthorn no 
litigation discussed above of million 
this increase in revenues combined with a million decrease in interest expense and million decrease in depreciation expense more than offset increases of million in purchased power expense  million in pension expense  million in power plant maintenance expense and million in transmission expense

this reduction was partially offset by continued load growth in load growth consists of higher usage per customer and the addition of new customers 
retail revenues increased million in compared to due to warmer summer weather and continued load growth  which included increased residential and commercial revenues of million mostly offset by a reduction in industrial revenues 
the reduction in industrial revenues was primarily due to a weakened economy and the loss of million in revenues from one of kcp l s major industrial customers

replacement power costs for planned wolf creek outages are accrued evenly over the unit s operating cycle 
kcp l expects its cost of nuclear fuel to remain fairly constant through the year coal has a significantly lower cost per mwh generated than natural gas and oil 
kcp l s procurement strategies continue to provide delivered coal costs below the regional average 
fossil plants averaged of total generation and the nuclear plant the remainder over the last three years 
the cost per mwh for purchased power is significantly higher than the fuel cost per mwh of coal and nuclear generation 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems to provide reliable power economically 
fuel expense increased million in compared to primarily due to a increase in mwhs generated 
this increase was partially offset by a lower average fuel cost per mwh generated due to increased coal and less natural gas and oil in the fuel mix and a million decrease related to the partial settlements of hawthorn no 
litigation 
fuel costs decreased million in compared to  despite a increase in generation 
lower fuel cost per mwh generated due to additional coal and less natural gas and oil in the fuel mix was the primary reason for the decline in fuel costs 
the return to service of hawthorn no 
 a low cost coal fired unit  in mid contributed to the change in generation fuel mix 
significantly lower natural gas prices and a reduction in the cost of uranium during also contributed to the lower fuel cost 
purchased power expense increased million in compared to excluding the million related to the partial settlements of hawthorn no 
litigation  approximately of the increase in is attributable to a increase in the price per mwh driven primarily by increased natural gas prices 
mwhs purchased increased in compared to due to increased customer needs 
purchased power expenses decreased million in compared to cost per mwh purchased decreased approximately in compared to due to regional energy availability  a less volatile energy market and decreased mwh purchases during peak hours 
also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in mwhs purchased due to the increased availability of kcp l s generating units 
consolidated kcp l other operating expenses including operating  maintenance and general taxes consolidated kcp l s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following o amortizing an additional million of the missouri jurisdictional portion of the january ice storm in o increased pension expense of million primarily due to a significant decline in the market value of plan assets o increased plant maintenance expense of million for plant outages and o increased transmission expenses of million primarily due to increased usage charges as a result of the increased wholesale mwh sales and increased mwh of purchased power o lower maintenance expense in due to expensing in the million of the kansas jurisdictional portion of the january ice storm 
consolidated kcp l s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following o expensing the million kansas jurisdictional portion of the january ice storm and amortizing million of the missouri jurisdictional portion of the ice storm o increased administrative and general expenses o increased pension expense of million due to a significant decline in the market value of plan assets o increased injuries and damages expenses of million resulting from additional claims and the settlement of outstanding claims o increased general taxes of million primarily due to increases in property tax levy rates 
consolidated kcp l depreciation consolidated kcp l s depreciation expense decreased million in compared to depreciation expense decreased approximately million due to the change to a year life for wolf creek pursuant to the kcc stipulation and agreement 
see critical accounting policies  regulatory matters for additional information 
this decrease was partially offset by increased depreciation expense of million related to capital additions and million as a result of the consolidation of the lease trust 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the lease trust 
consolidated kcp l s depreciation expense increased million in compared to primarily due to increased capital additions relating to hawthorn no 
 which was returned to service mid additionally  kcp l exercised its purchase option on the previously leased hawthorn no 
unit in late consolidated kcp l interest charges consolidated kcp l s interest charges decreased million in compared to kcp l s long term debt interest expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to lower levels of outstanding long term debt as a result of the repayment of million of medium term notes in lower average interest rates in compared to also contributed to the decrease 
consolidated kcp l s interest charges increased million in compared to kcp l s long term debt interest expense increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher average levels of long term debt outstanding 
lower average rates on variable rate long term debt partially offset the higher average levels of long term debt 
the higher average levels of debt outstanding primarily reflect the issuances of long term debt in and the issuance of million of unsecured  fixed rate senior notes partially offset by million of scheduled debt repayments during kcp l s short term debt interest expense decreased million in compared to average interest rates were down more than and average levels of outstanding commercial paper were down more than in compared to kcp l had no commercial paper outstanding at december  allowance for borrowed funds used to finance construction decreased million in compared to due to decreased construction work in progress primarily due to the return to service of hawthorn no 
in mid wolf creek wolf creek  a nuclear unit  is of kcp l s base load generating capacity and of kcp l s total generating capacity  including the addition of five leased combustion turbines that added peaking capacity 
wolf creek s operating performance has remained strong over the last three years  contributing an average of of kcp l s annual mwh generation while operating at an average capacity of 
wolf creek has the lowest fuel cost per mwh generated of any of kcp l s generating units 
kcp l accrues the incremental operating  maintenance and replacement power costs for planned outages evenly over the unit s operating cycle  normally months 
as actual outage expenses are incurred  the refueling liability and related deferred tax asset are reduced 
wolf creek returned to service on december   following a scheduled day refueling and maintenance outage that was extended days for a reactor head assembly inspection 
the extension did not have a material impact on kcp l s results of operations 
the next outage is scheduled for the spring of and is estimated to be a day outage 
wolf creek s assets represent approximately of kcp l s assets and its operating expenses represent approximately of kcp l s operating expenses 
an extended shut down of wolf creek could have a substantial adverse effect on kcp l s business  financial condition and results of operations because of higher replacement power and other costs 
although not expected  the nrc could impose an unscheduled plant shut down  reacting to safety concerns at the plant or other similar nuclear units 
if a long term shut down occurred  the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base 
there has been significant opposition and delays to development of a low level radioactive waste disposal facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
an inability to complete this project would require kcp l to write off its net investment in the project  which was million at december  kcp l  and the other owners of wolf creek  could also still be required to participate in development of an alternate site 
ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes kcp l to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit s life and to potential retrospective assessments and property losses in excess of insurance coverage 
these risks are more fully discussed in the related sections of notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
kcp l projected utility capital expenditures total utility capital expenditures  excluding allowance for funds used to finance construction  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
utility capital expenditures projected for the next three years are as follows millions generating facilities nuclear fuel distribution and transmission facilities general facilities total this utility capital expenditure plan is subject to continual review and change 
general facilities in includes a million expenditure to buy out the operating lease for vehicles and heavy equipment 
kcp l is currently evaluating purchase and construction options to meet capacity and energy requirements in and thereafter

strategic energy strategic energy business overview strategic energy provides retail electricity services by entering into long term contracts with its customers to supply electricity 
in return  strategic energy receives an ongoing management fee  which is included in the contracted sales price for the electricity 
of the states that offer retail choice  strategic energy operates in california  massachusetts  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
strategic energy is targeting expansion into connecticut and maryland in  as well as expansion into additional utility territories in ohio and texas 
strategic energy also provides strategic planning and consulting services in the natural gas and electricity markets 
great plains energy s indirect ownership in strategic energy currently totals 
in the normal course of business  great plains energy and klt inc provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of strategic energy in the form of guarantees to those third parties 
additionally  great plains energy provides guarantees and indemnities supporting letters of credit and surety bonds obtained by strategic energy 
these agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to strategic energy on a stand alone basis  thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish strategic energy s intended business purposes 
at december   strategic energy provided retail electricity services on behalf of approximately  commercial  institutional and small manufacturing accounts 
strategic energy s diverse customer base  totaling over  customers  includes numerous fortune companies  smaller companies  and governmental entities 
based solely on current signed contracts and expected usage  strategic energy has forecasted future mwh commitments of million  million and million for the years through  respectively 
strategic energy expects to deliver additional mwh sales in these years through growth in existing markets by re signing existing customers and by signing new customers as well as through expansion into new markets 
strategic energy s projected mwh sales for based on signed contracts and expected additional mwh sales are in the range of million to million mwhs 
strategic energy maintains a commodity price risk management strategy that uses forward physical energy purchases and derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
as a result of supplying electricity to retail customers under fixed rate contracts  strategic energy s policy is to match customers demand with fixed price purchases 
in certain markets where strategic energy operates  entering into forward fixed price contracts is cost prohibitive 
derivative instruments  primarily swaps  are used to limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity purchases 
these instruments effectively fix the future purchase price of electricity  protecting strategic energy from price volatility

strategic energy supplier concentration and credit risk credit risk represents the loss that strategic energy could incur if a counterparty failed to perform under its contractual obligations 
to reduce its credit exposure  strategic energy enters into payment netting agreements with certain counterparties that permit strategic energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
strategic energy further manages credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable strategic energy to terminate the transaction or modify collateral thresholds upon the occurrence of credit related events 
based on guidelines set by its exposure management committee  strategic energy monitors its counterparty credit risk by routinely evaluating the credit quality and performance of its suppliers 
among other things  strategic energy monitors counterparty credit ratings  liquidity and results of operations 
as a result of these evaluations  strategic energy may  among other things  establish counterparty credit limits and adjust the amount of collateral required from its suppliers 
strategic energy enters into forward contracts with multiple suppliers 
at december   strategic energy s five largest suppliers under forward supply contracts represented of the total future committed purchases 
strategic energy s five largest suppliers  or their guarantors  are rated investment grade 
in the event of supplier non delivery or default  strategic energy s results of operations could be affected to the extent the cost of replacement power exceeded the combination of the contracted price with the supplier and the amount of collateral held by strategic energy to mitigate its credit risk with the supplier 
strategic energy s results of operations could also be affected  in a given period  if it was required to make a payment upon termination of a supplier contract to the extent that the contracted price with the supplier exceeded the market value of the contract at the time of termination 
the following table provides information on strategic energy s credit exposure  net of collateral  as of december  it further delineates the exposure by the credit rating of counterparties and provides guidance on the concentration of credit risk and an indication of the maturity of the credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties 
number of net exposure of counterparties counterparties exposure greater than greater than before credit credit net of net of net rating collateral collateral exposure exposure exposure millions millions external rating investment grade non investment grade internal rating investment grade non investment grade total maturity of credit risk exposure before credit collateral exposure less than greater than rating years years years total exposure millions external rating investment grade non investment grade internal rating investment grade non investment grade total external ratings are determined by using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty 
if a counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity  the determination has been based on the rating of its guarantor 
internal ratings are determined by  among other things  an analysis of the counterparty s financial statements and consideration of publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty s parent 
investment grade counterparties are those with a minimum senior unsecured debt standard poor s rating of bbb or a moody s rating of baa exposure before credit collateral has been calculated considering all netting agreements in place  netting accounts payable and receivable exposure with net mark to market exposure 
exposure before credit collateral is impacted primarily by the power supply volume under contract with a given counterparty and the relationship between current market prices and contracted power supply prices 
credit collateral includes the amount of cash deposits  guarantees and letters of credit received from counterparties 
net exposure has only been calculated for those counterparties to which strategic energy is exposed and excludes counterparties exposed to strategic energy 
at december   strategic energy had exposure before credit collateral to non investment grade counterparties totaling million of which is scheduled to mature in less than two years 
in addition  strategic energy held collateral totaling million limiting its net exposure to these non investment grade counterparties to million at december  in july  mirant filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy court entered an interim order  which ordered mirant to comply with the terms of its prepetition trading contracts 
in accordance with the master power purchase and sale agreement and the isda master agreement between strategic energy and mirant  the million collateral threshold limit in both agreements was reduced to zero upon the bankruptcy filing 
since that time  mirant and strategic energy have continued to perform under the conditions of their agreements 
the interim order was finalized and mirant has assumed its contracts with strategic energy 
strategic energy is continuing to pursue a strategy of contracting with national and regional counterparties that have direct supplies and assets in the region of demand 
strategic energy is also continuing to address counterparty issues with strict margining and collateral requirements  netting of credit exposures against payable balances  preferences for higher credit quality counterparties and  in some cases  replacement of lower quality counterparty contracts 
strategic energy results of operations the following table summarizes strategic energy s comparative results of operations 
millions operating revenues  purchased power other operating expenses depreciation operating income non operating income expenses interest charges income taxes net income strategic energy s net income increased million in compared to the increased net income is primarily due to continued growth in retail electric sales from the expansion into new markets and continued sales efforts in existing markets 
in addition to continued growth  great plains energy s ownership of strategic energy was increased by in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses including employee related expenses 
also  revenues less purchased power divided by mwh sold gross margin per mwh decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gross margin per mwh in compared to was primarily due to the roll off of higher margin contracts that were obtained during periods of high market price volatility in late and early and to a lesser extent market conditions  including increased competition 
strategic energy currently expects the gross margin per mwh on new customer contracts to average to and the gross margin per mwh on total customer contracts to average to in strategic energy s net income increased million in compared to  however  net income included earnings of million from the sale of power purchased from one supplier under wholesale contracts that expired at the end of the increased net income in compared to is primarily due to continued growth in retail electric sales from the expansion into new markets and continued sales efforts in existing markets  partially offset by increased labor and benefits as well as other general and administrative expenses and income taxes due to increased sales in states with higher income tax rates 
strategic energy operating revenues operating revenues from strategic energy increased million in compared to and million in compared to as shown in the following table 
change change millions electric retail  electric wholesale gas and other total operating revenues  at december   strategic energy served over  customers  a increase from approximately  customers at the end of customers at the end of increased from  customers at the end of these customers represented approximately  accounts at the end of  a increase from approximately  accounts at the end of accounts at the end of increased from approximately  accounts at the end of retail electric revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to increased retail mwh sales 
retail mwhs sold increased approximately to million in from million in the increase in mwh sales resulted primarily from effective sales efforts in re signing approximately of existing customers as well as signing new customers in markets in which strategic energy continued to experience favorable conditions for growth 
mwh sales in california increased to million in from million in and mwh sales in texas increased to million in from million in retail electric revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to increased retail mwh sales  partially offset by an decrease in average retail revenues per mwh 
retail mwhs sold increased to million in from million in  primarily from continued growth in existing markets and expansion into new markets during growth in existing markets came primarily from strong sales efforts in re signing existing customers as well as signing new customers 
expansion into new markets contributed million in mwh sales and approximately million of retail electric revenues during several factors contribute to changes in the average retail revenues per mwh  including the underlying price of the commodity  the nature and type of products offered and the mix of sales by geographic market 
strategic energy purchased power strategic energy primarily purchases power under long term forward physical delivery contracts to supply electricity to its retail energy customers based on projected usage 
strategic energy sells any excess retail supply of electricity back into the wholesale market 
the proceeds from the sale of excess supply of electricity are recorded as a reduction of purchased power 
the amount of excess retail supply sales that reduced purchased power was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
strategic energy utilizes derivatives in the procurement of electricity that are economic hedges but not considered accounting hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as a component of purchased power 
the amounts were insignificant for all periods presented 
as previously discussed  strategic energy operates in several retail choice electricity markets 
the cost of supplying electricity to retail customers can vary widely by geographic market 
this variability can be affected by many factors including  among other items  geographic differences in the cost per mwh of purchased power and capacity charges due to regional purchased power availability and requirements of other electricity providers and differences in transmission charges 
however  strategic energy has mitigated the effects of higher supply costs by entering into long term  full requirements contracts with customers that are priced to the customers based on the cost of the associated supply contract 
purchased power increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to primarily due to the increases in electric mwh sales discussed above 
additionally  purchased power expense as a percentage of electric revenues increased in compared to primarily due to purchases of power from one supplier during under wholesale contracts that expired at the end of strategic energy other operating expenses strategic energy s other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues decreased to in from and and  respectively  due to strategic energy s efforts in leveraging its infrastructure and the effects of achieving economies of scale 
other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs from the addition of employees and higher other general and administrative expenses associated with higher sales volumes  geographic market expansion  and regulatory and market development initiatives 
other operating expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a million decrease in the cost of commercial gas sales from strategic energy s natural gas retail supply service  which was phased out by the end of this decrease was mostly offset by increased labor and benefit costs from the addition of employees and increasing health care related costs  higher profit sharing and deferred compensation expense which are tied to earnings and financial performance  and higher other general and administrative expenses associated with higher sales volumes  geographic market expansion  and regulatory and market development initiatives 
strategic energy non operating income expenses strategic energy s non operating income expenses includes non operating income less minority interest expense and non operating expenses 
minority interest expense represents the share of strategic energy s net income not attributable to great plains energy s indirect ownership interest in strategic energy 
non operating income expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a million decrease in minority interest expense resulting from great plains energy s acquisition of an additional indirect ownership interest in strategic energy during the fourth quarter of non operating income expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to a gain of million recognized on the sale of gas contracts during the second quarter of and an increase in minority interest expense of million 
klt gas klt gas business overview and plan to exit the gas exploration and development business in february  the great plains energy board of directors approved management s recommendation to sell the klt gas portfolio and exit the gas business 
the company evaluated this business and determined the amount of capital and the length of time required for development of reserves and production  combined with the earnings volatility of the exploration process  are no longer compatible with the company s strategic vision 
management will continue to operate the klt gas portfolio during the sale process  which it expects to complete during see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in addition to the first quarter write down of the klt gas portfolio to its estimated realizable value discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management expects to incur losses during to operate klt gas while it markets the klt gas portfolio for sale 
management estimates the losses to operate klt gas will approximate million before taxes  which after taxes would reduce earnings by approximately million 
the after tax losses will be reflected as a loss from discontinued operations in great plains energy s consolidated statements of income in the periods incurred 
the estimated losses to operate klt gas anticipate completion of a sale of the klt gas portfolio at december  the ultimate impact to great plains energy s consolidated statements of income for will be different than the estimates to the extent costs to operate deviate from the budget and or the timing of the klt gas portfolio sale deviates from december  prior to the decision to exit the business  klt gas focused on exploring for  developing  and producing unconventional natural gas resources  including coalbed methane properties 
klt gas leased properties are primarily located in colorado  kansas and wyoming with some leases in nebraska and texas 
in  klt gas completed the sale of approximately  undeveloped acres in kansas 
klt gas follows the full cost accounting method for its natural gas properties  under which the acreage sale was accounted for as an adjustment to capitalized costs with no gain recognized in earnings 
in  klt gas leased additional acreage in the rocky mountain region 
exploration of portions of the newly acquired acreage commenced in the third quarter of in addition  klt gas continued to test a new prospect in colorado as well as the development of a pilot project in the powder river basin and two additional projects in the rocky mountain region

subsidiary of klt telecom files for bankruptcy dti the accounting treatment related to dti and its bankruptcy is complex and is addressed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  consequently  note in its entirety is incorporated by reference in this portion of management s discussion and analysis and should be read as a component of this discussion 
on december   a subsidiary of klt telecom  holdings and its subsidiaries  digital teleport and digital teleport of virginia  inc  filed separate voluntary petitions in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of missouri for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  which cases have been procedurally consolidated 
holdings and its two subsidiaries are collectively called dti 
in december  digital teleport entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of its assets asset sale to centurytel fiber company ii  llc centurytel  a nominee of centurytel  inc the asset sale was approved by the bankruptcy court in and closed in klt telecom received million in related to the confirmation of the dti bankruptcy 
additionally  klt telecom realized approximately million of cash tax benefits in pending final resolution of the modor claim and the put option of a certain minority shareholder which are described below  the company recorded a net gain of million or per share in the impact on net income was primarily due to the net effect of the confirmation of the dti bankruptcy and the resulting distribution  the reversal of a million tax valuation allowance and the reversal of a million debtor in possession financing commitment previously reserved 
in early  klt telecom paid million to certain executives of digital teleport for entering into employment agreements required as a condition precedent to the asset sale 
the amount was recorded as a liability in the bankruptcy court conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding three priority proofs of claim by the missouri department of revenue in the aggregate amount of million collectively  the modor claim  and ruled substantially in favor of digital teleport 
modor appealed this ruling 
klt telecom may receive an additional distribution from the bankruptcy estate  however  the amount and timing of any additional distribution is dependant upon the outcome of the modor appeal 
klt telecom originally acquired a interest in dti in on february   klt telecom acquired control of dti by purchasing shares from another holdings shareholder  weinstein  increasing its ownership to 
in connection with this purchase  klt telecom granted weinstein a put option 
the put option provided for the sale by weinstein of his remaining shares in holdings to klt telecom during a period beginning september   and ending august  the put option provides for an aggregate exercise price for these remaining shares equal to their fair market value with an aggregate floor amount of million 
the floor amount of the put option was fully reserved during the fourth quarter of  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on september   weinstein delivered a notice of exercise of his claimed rights under the put option 
klt telecom rejected the notice of exercise 
klt telecom denied that weinstein has any remaining rights or claims pursuant to the put option  and denied any obligation to pay weinstein any amount under the put option 
subsequent to klt telecom s rejection of his notice of exercise  weinstein filed suit alleging breach of contract 
see item legal proceedings for additional information 
the operating results of dti have been included for the period february  date of acquisition through september   for consolidated kcp l and through december   for great plains energy 
because of dti s bankruptcy filings  klt telecom no longer had control over nor could it exert significant control over dti 
as a consequence  as of december   dti was de consolidated and presented on the cost basis 
consequently  klt telecom did not include in its financial results the ongoing results of operations  earnings or losses incurred by dti since december  because of the bankruptcy filings  a million net write off was included in gain loss on property in operating expenses on great plains energy s consolidated statement of income 
a corresponding tax benefit of million was included in income taxes 
the net impact of the bankruptcy to income was a million reduction 
income taxes reported in do not reflect the entire effect of the net write off because of the uncertainty of recognizing future tax deductions while in the bankruptcy process 
other during  klt energy services wrote off its million cost basis investment in the common stock of bracknell corporation bracknell due to a decline in its share price and the bankruptcy filing of one of bracknell s subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s great plains energy and consolidated kcp l are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply  interest rates and equity prices 
market risks are handled in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  great plains energy and consolidated kcp l also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include business  legal  operational and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis 
commodity risk kcp l and strategic energy engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and accordingly  are exposed to risk associated with the price of electricity 
kcp l s wholesale operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and long  intermediate and short term capacity energy contracts 
kcp l maintains a capacity margin of at least of its peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity and power purchase agreements to protect it from the potential operational failure of one of its owned or contracted power generating units 
the agreements contain penalties for non performance to protect kcp l from energy price risk on the contracted energy 
kcp l also enters into additional power purchase agreements with the objective of obtaining the most economical energy to meet its physical delivery obligations to its customers 
kcp l continually evaluates the need for additional risk mitigation measures in order to minimize its financial exposure to  among other things  spikes in wholesale power prices during periods of high demand 
kcp l s sales include the sales of electricity to its retail customers and bulk power sales of electricity in the wholesale market 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  the availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems  therefore  the impact of the hypothetical amounts that follow could be significantly reduced depending on the system requirements and market prices at the time of the increases 
during  approximately of kcp l s net mwhs generated was coal fired 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of coal could have resulted in a million decrease in pretax earnings for kcp l currently has almost all of its coal requirements for and under contract 
an insignificant amount of the expected delivered cost of coal is subject to price fluctuations 
in  approximately was subject to the market price of coal 
kcp l has implemented price risk mitigation measures to reduce its exposure to high natural gas prices 
a hypothetical increase in natural gas and oil market prices would have resulted in a decrease of less than million in pretax earnings 
approximately of kcp l s summer projected gas generation requirements for retail and firm wholesale sales are price protected through its hedging program  which is consistent with the percentages hedged in a hypothetical increase in the cost of purchased power could have resulted in a million decrease in pretax earnings for strategic energy maintains a commodity price risk management strategy that uses forward physical energy purchases and derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
as a result of supplying electricity to retail customers  strategic energy s policy is to match customers demand with fixed price purchases 
in certain markets where strategic energy operates  entering into forward fixed price contracts is cost prohibitive 
by entering into swap contracts for a portion of its forecasted purchases in these markets  the future purchase price of electricity is effectively fixed under these swap contracts 
the swap contracts limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity purchases 
klt gas is exposed to commodity price risk on the natural gas it produces 
financial hedge instruments can be used to mitigate its exposure to market price fluctuations on approximately of its daily gas sales in accordance with its risk management policy 
currently  klt gas is producing an insignificant volume of gas and the price risk is minimal 
kcp l and strategic energy are not required to record energy transactions at fair value 
commitments to purchase and sell energy and energy related products except for derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are currently carried at cost 
kcp l and strategic energy report the revenue and expense associated with all energy contracts at the time the underlying physical transaction closes consistent with industry practice and the business philosophy of generating purchasing and delivering physical power to customers 
interest rate risk great plains energy manages interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
using outstanding balances and annualized interest rates as of december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with variable rate debt would have resulted in a decrease of less than million in pretax earnings for additionally  interest rates impact the fair value of long term debt 
a change in interest rates would impact the company to the extent it redeemed any of its outstanding long term debt 
great plains energy and consolidated kcp l book value of long term debt was below fair value at december  equity price risk kcp l maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc  to fund certain costs of decommissioning its wolf creek nuclear power plant 
kcp l does not expect wolf creek decommissioning to start before as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on the kcp l s balance sheets 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs  however the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  and the value of fixed rate fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
investment performance and asset allocation are periodically reviewed 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates resulting in a hypothetical decrease in the value of the fixed income securities would have resulted in a million reduction in the value of the decommissioning trust funds 
a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would have resulted in a million reduction in the fair value of the equity securities as of december  kcp l s exposure to equity price market risk associated with the decommissioning trust funds is in large part mitigated due to the fact that kcp l is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs in its rates 
klt investments has affordable housing notes that require the greater of of the outstanding note balances or the next annual installment to be held as cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities 
a hypothetical decrease in market prices of the securities held as collateral would have resulted in a decrease of less than million in pretax earnings for
