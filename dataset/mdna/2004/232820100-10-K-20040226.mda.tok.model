year ended december   compared with year ended december  consolidated results net sales for were  up  compared to  for overall  sales volume increased with acquisitions accounting for of this increase  favorable changes in currency rates adding  and higher selling prices adding 
for a detailed discussion on sales refer to the segment results section below 
manufacturing cost of sales was  or of net sales  for compared to  or  of net sales  for included in is a net restructuring charge or of net sales for plant closure costs and expenses associated with discontinuing a product line 
additional savings related to restructuring initiative were in which was the result of planned personnel reductions under the initiative 
manufacturing costs in were also impacted by higher raw material and energy costs of  particularly from petroleum based products globally and natural gas based products in the u 
s 
and currency rate changes increased cost freight and warehousing increased of which was due to currency rates changes 
the remainder of the increase in freight and warehousing is due primarily to sales volume increases as well as higher freight rates and fuel surcharges 
insurance costs increased over partially offsetting this were lower costs as a result of the company s operational excellence initiatives 
pension expense increased principally as a result of the company lowering its discount rate in the u 
s 
by to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities and by the acquisitions which increased pension expense by this was partly offset by plan changes to the retirement medical plans in the u 
s 
which were instituted by the company in and reduced expense by pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales 
see critical accounting policies  retirement plans for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense 
selling and technical services increased included in prior year amounts are net restructuring charges of additional savings related to restructuring were in primarily as a result of planned personnel reductions 
costs associated with the acquisitions in added and costs associated with the company s performance stock plan increased by due to a higher market value for the company s common stock

currency rate changes increased sales with acquisitions adding 
base volume increased  and selling prices declined 
north american volumes increased with the acquisitions of the metal extractant and aromatic phosphines product lines of avecia accounting for 
also  the water treatment product line selling volume was down as the company exited certain low profit municipal business but this was offset by increased phosphine gas sales 
in latin america  the volume growth of was primarily in the mining chemicals product line as a result of higher demand in the alumina market and acquisitions accounting for 
asia pacific volumes decreased  volume included sales for an initial fill of the company s solvent extraction product at one of the worlds largest cobalt nickel mines 
europe volumes increased primarily in the water treatment product line 
currency rate changes were primarily the result of the weaker u 
s 
dollar  except in latin america where the u 
s 
dollar remained strong for the first three quarters of selling prices decreased in north america in all product lines due to customer mix and competitive pricing 
latin america pricing increased offsetting the impact of negative currency rate changes

restructuring savings increased in compared to the remaining increase in gross profit margins was due to lower raw material and energy costs and increased production levels in the company s specialty chemicals segments 
pension expense increased principally as a result of a decrease in the discount rate that was used to determine pension expense to reflect market rates available on fixed income securities 
the company also lowered its long term return on assets assumption from to 
the resulting increase in pension expense was partly offset by plan changes to the retirement medical plans adopted by the company in which reduced expense by see critical accounting policies  retirement plans  below for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense

water and industrial process chemicals change due to total change price volume mix currency north america latin america asia pacific europe middle east africa total the decreases in selling volumes were due to lower water treatment sales in the north american market  primarily the municipal water market  that the company was de emphasizing in favor of industrial markets 
the paper and oilfield markets reflect lower levels of economic activity 
selling volumes for mining chemicals in the north and latin american regions were lower each due to lower economic activity 
in the asia pacific region selling volumes for mining chemicals were up due to increased demand in the copper and cobalt nickel markets  and in particular an initial fill at one of the world s largest cobalt nickel mines

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates  commodity prices  interest rates and equity price changes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  the company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with company established policies 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  the company enters into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and makes reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
currency risk the risk of adverse currency rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of currency exposure outside the u 
s 
in addition  the company periodically enters into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business 
at december   the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable  accounts payable and intercompany loans 
when hedging currency exposures  the company s practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   the currency and net contractual amounts of the company s forward contracts translated into u 
s 
dollar equivalent amounts were as follows buy norwegian canadian sell euro krone dollar u 
s 
dollar pound sterling euro other the fair value of currency contracts  based on forward exchange rates at december   exceeded contract values by approximately assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would be a decrease of approximately however  since these contracts hedge specific transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
commodity price risk the company frequently uses natural gas forward contracts and swaps to reduce the volatility of natural gas costs used for utility purposes at certain of its facilities 
these contracts typically correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the company pays for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are primarily structured to limit the company s exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit the company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
at december   the company had outstanding natural gas forward contracts with a notional value of and delivery dates of january through october and outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value gain of  which will be reclassified into manufacturing cost of sales in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings 
at december   based on year end nymex prices  the company had net unrealized gains on its natural gas forward contracts of assuming that year end prices were to decrease by a hypothetical  the above gain would be reduced by approximately interest rate risk in march the company repaid of its outstanding borrowings 
in june  the company sold principal amount of notes due july  at december   the outstanding borrowings of the company consisted of fixed rate long term debt  which had a carrying value of  a face value of and a fair value  based on dealer quoted values  of approximately at december   the company was a party to two interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the interest cost on a total of of the company s notes to a floating rate basis for the life of the notes 
the fair value as of december  of the company s interest rate swaps was assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt 
accordingly  assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would increase approximately per annum and the fair market value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately other outlook in its january  earnings press release  which was also filed as an exhibit to a current report on form k  the company set forth its assumptions and management s best current estimate of first quarter and full year earnings at that time based on various assumptions set forth in its press release 
the company forecasted diluted earnings per share range in the range of for the year  a increase over s diluted earnings per share of  before the cumulative effect of the accounting change  and first quarter diluted earnings per share in the range of 
the company s guidance for outlook will be updated when it reports first quarter earnings in april there can be no assurance sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected 
actual results may differ materially 
see comments on forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
environmental and other contingent liabilities accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation  and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability ahs been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities  without any discount to reflect the time value of money 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the amount accrued for environment remediation reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature and cost of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation  product liability and toxic tort claims 
the amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects the company s assumptions about the incidence  severity  indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if the company s assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
the company cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts 
moreover  environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty 
accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other non current liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses 
probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future costs are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets 
a number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements 
these factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance polices  the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and the interrelationships  and the company s historical recovery rates over the past ten years 
defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred 
probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are accrued when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets

retirement plans the company sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
the company s most significant pension plans are in the u 
s  and constituted over of the company s consolidated pension assets and of projected benefit obligations as of december  the calculation of the company s pension expense and pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
the company believes that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of and at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense 
for example  a change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the discount rate would change pension expense by approximately and postretirement benefit expense by a negligible amount 
the decrease in the discount rate assumption is expected to increase the company s net periodic pension expense for the u 
s 
pension plans by approximately million in compared to the company s net periodic benefit expense for the u 
s 
postretirement welfare plans is expected to increase by approximately million in compared to the expected rate of return on plan assets reflects the long term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the historical returns of major asset classes  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and estimates of future long term investment returns 
the u

the expected rate of return on assets in the u

the estimate of contributions is based on significant assumptions  such as pension plan benefit levels  interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns

impairment of goodwill the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas effective january  under sfas  identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their useful life unless the useful life is determined to be indefinite 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets are no longer amortized  but instead are reviewed for impairment and written down only in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value 
the company does not have intangibles with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill 
the company has defined its segments as its sfas reporting units 
the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company uses a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  the reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value 
the company utilizes a market multiple approach to determine fair value estimates 
due to the cyclical nature of the company s reporting unit s  values are determined utilizing a three year average 
the three year period is comprised of the prior year  current year and one year projected amounts 
if the market multiple approach yields a result  which may indicate a possible impairment  a discounted cash flow approach is utilized to more precisely determine the reporting unit s fair value 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company is not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  as well as the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  involves significant judgment in estimating future taxable income in each of the jurisdictions to which these tax benefits relate 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company intends to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries 
accordingly  no provision has been made for u 
s 
or additional non u 
s 
taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the u 
s  such earnings would be subject to u
