factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in factors affecting operating results below as well as those discussed elsewhere 
overview illumina  inc was incorporated in april we are developing next generation tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine  a key goal of genomics 
using our technologies  we have developed a comprehensive line of products that are designed to provide the throughput  cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics 
this information is expected to correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states  enhancing drug discovery  allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically  and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients 
in november  we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems under which the companies would jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray technology with applied biosystems assay chemistry and scanner technology 
under this agreement  we were primarily responsible for developing and manufacturing the arrays and applied biosystems was primarily responsible for developing and manufacturing the instruments  snp assay reagents  and software and for marketing the system worldwide 
in conjunction with the agreement  applied biosystems purchased million shares of series c convertible preferred stock at per share 
in addition  applied biosystems agreed to provide us with non refundable research and development support of million  all of which was provided by december upon commercialization of the system  we would have received a share of the operating profits from the sales of all components of these systems 
we had originally deferred recognition of revenue from the research funding of million provided by applied biosystems  and would have recognized such amounts as revenue at a contractually defined rate of of the total profit share we earned from the sales of 
table of contents collaboration products  had such sales occurred 
as of december   this amount has been reclassified to an advance payment from former collaborator 
in july  applied biosystems indicated that the planned mid launch of this genotyping system would be delayed a second time 
this delay was related to applied biosystems inability to optimize and multiplex the snp assay reagents 
we do not believe that applied biosystems has any intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product with us  and it has recently launched a competing product 
as a result of the delay in developing the collaboration product  we launched our own production scale genotyping system in july utilizing our arrays and an independently developed scanner and assay method 
in december  applied biosystems filed a complaint  then later in march amended and refiled a complaint  for a patent infringement suit against us in the federal court in northern california asserting infringement of several patents related to applied biosystems patented assay intended for use in our collaboration 
applied biosystems seeks a judgment granting it damages for infringement  treble damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement 
we have answered the complaint  asserting various defenses  including that we do not infringe the patents or that the patents are invalid  and asserting counterclaims against applied biosystems seeking declaratory judgment relief related to the patents being asserted against us  and seeking damages from applied biosystems for its unfair and unlawful conduct which constitutes attempted monopolization in violation of the antitrust laws 
also in december  applied biosystems sent a notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement entered into in november and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement 
this notification alleged that our production scale genotyping products and services are collaboration products developed under the joint development agreement  and that our commercial activities with respect to our genotyping products and services are unlawful  unfair or fraudulent 
among other relief  applied biosystems is seeking compensatory damages of million  disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of these products and services and a prohibition of future sales of these products or services 
in december  we filed a suit alleging breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  unfair competition and other allegations against applied biosystems in san diego superior court  and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by applied biosystems 
in december  we notified applied biosystems that we terminated the joint development agreement 
in december  after having granted temporary and preliminary injunctions staying the arbitration  the san diego superior court directed applied biosystems and us to resolve the contract dispute in a binding arbitration procedure 
while a definitive schedule has not yet been set  we believe that the arbitration process could be completed as early as september we will vigorously defend against the claims alleged by applied biosystems but the outcome of an arbitration proceeding is inherently uncertain and we cannot be sure that we will prevail 
this arbitration could result in a range of potential outcomes  based solely on the judgment and discretion of the arbitrator  including the award of all damages and injunctive relief sought by applied biosystems  the award of all damages and relief sought by us  or a partial award of damages and or injunctive relief to either party 
we have not accrued for any potential losses in this case because we believe that an adverse determination is not probable  and potential losses cannot be reasonably estimated 
in addition  our financial statements include a million advance payment from applied biosystems that would have been deducted from the profits otherwise payable to us from applied biosystems had the collaboration been successful and which could offset the impact on our consolidated results of operations of an adverse arbitration determination up to that amount 
however  any unfavorable arbitration determination  and in particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by us or prohibition of the sale of our products or services  could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are in the early stages of proceedings in the patent case 
in february  the federal district court in northern california ordered that the patent case be stayed pending completion of the arbitration process 
we intend to vigorously defend against the claims alleged by applied biosystems and continue to pursue our counterclaims against applied biosystems 
however  we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these matters 
any unfavorable determination  and in particular any significant cash amounts required to be paid by us or prohibition of the sale of our products or services  could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the first quarter of  we began commercial sale of short pieces of dna  or oligos  manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology 
we believe our oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies  which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides under a price leadership strategy while still achieving attractive gross margins 
in the second quarter of  we initiated our snp genotyping services product line 
as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput  low cost beadarray technology  we have entered into genotyping services contracts with many of the leading genotyping organizations including glaxosmithkline and the sanger centre  and have been awarded million from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the international hapmap project 
our production scale genotyping system  beadlab  is based on the system we developed that has been operational in our genotyping service product line since in addition to our sentrix array matrices  it includes the beadarray reader  a proprietary scanner that uses a laser to read the results of experiments captured on our arrays  as well as the goldengate snp genotyping assay which can analyze up to snps per dna sample 
this system is initially being marketed to a small number of high throughput genotyping users 
in the first quarter of  we completed the installation of and recorded revenue for our first beadlab high throughput snp genotyping system 
we installed and recorded revenue for a second beadlab in the second quarter of  two additional beadlabs in the third quarter of and a fifth and sixth beadlab system in the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  we announced the launch of a new array format  the sentrix beadchip  which is expected to significantly expand market opportunities for our beadarray technology and provide increased experimental flexibility for life science researchers 
in the third quarter of  we announced the launch of a gene expression product line on both the sentrix array matrix and the sentrix beadchip that will allow researchers to analyze a focused set of genes across eight to samples on a single array 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced the launch of a benchtop snp genotyping system  the beadstation  for performing medium scale genotyping using our technology 
the beadstation includes our beadarray reader  genotyping analysis software and goldengate assay reagents and is designed to match the throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research groups and core labs 
this system is expected to be available for shipment in the second quarter of in the first quarter of  we announced the launch of two new sentrix beadchips for whole genome gene expression 
these beadchips are designed to enable high performance  cost effective  whole genome expression profiling of multiple samples on a single chip  resulting in a dramatic reduction in cost of whole genome expression analysis while allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of large scale biological experimentation 
we are seeking to expand our customer base for our beadarray technology  however  we can give no assurance that our sales efforts will continue to be successful 
a significant portion of our current revenue is derived from a few  large individual transactions such as the sale of production genotyping systems and large genotyping services contracts  including our work on the international hapmap project 
because these transactions do not occur regularly and 
table of contents there is a lengthy sales cycle for such transactions  revenue of these types may not occur on a consistent or frequent basis 
in addition  our total amount of revenues is subject to fluctuations in demand from seasonality impacts  the timing and amount of us government grant funding programs  the timing and size of research projects our customers perform and changes in overall spending levels in the life science industry 
given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products  we may experience quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenue  resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and net income or loss  we believe quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million  and total stockholders equity was million 
these losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research  development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services  as well as charges of million related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
we expect to continue to incur substantial costs for research  development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years 
we will also need to significantly increase our selling  general and administrative costs as we build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems  other products and services 
as a result  we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve profitability results of operations to enhance comparability  the following table sets forth audited consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   december  and december  stated as a percentage of total revenue

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands product revenue service revenue research revenue total revenue revenue for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
product revenue increased to million in from million in the increase resulted almost entirely from the first sales of our beadlab snp genotyping system  with six systems sold in the year ended december   along with sales of consumables that are used on these systems 
prior to we had no sales of genotyping systems or consumable products 
snp genotyping service revenue increased to million in from million in substantially all of this increase relates to genotyping services performed for the international hapmap project  which commenced in we are the recipient of a grant from the national institutes of health covering our participation in the international hapmap project  which is a million  internationally funded successor project to the human genome project that will help identify a map of genetic variations that may be used to perform disease related research 
we could receive up to million of funding for this project which covers basic research activities  the development of snp assays and the genotyping to be performed on those assays 
we recognized revenue under this grant of million in and  as of the end of  we had approximately million of funding remaining related to this project which is expected to be received in  depending on the actual amount of work that we perform 
government grants and other research funding increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to an increase in the number of grants received 
to expand revenue in the future  we have recently launched a series of new products that we expect to begin selling in these include our beadstation system for moderate throughput genotyping needs  and two multi sample whole genome gene expression beadchips that are also processed on a beadstation 
our beadlab systems address a limited number of potential high throughput genotyping customers  and sales of these systems may decline in versus we expect the sales of the new products mentioned above to offset such decline and for overall revenues to increase above levels  however  we cannot be assured that we will be successful in these sales efforts 
cost of product and service revenue year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands cost of product and service revenue cost of revenue represents manufacturing costs incurred in the production process  including component materials  assembly labor and overhead  packaging and delivery cost 
costs related to research revenue is included in research and development expense 
cost of product and service revenue increased to million the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  substantially all of this increase was driven by the sales of our beadlab systems and consumables  of which we had none in  as well as the higher level of services revenue during gross margins on product and service revenues were in the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is due 
table of contents primarily to increased sales of higher margin products and services such as snp genotyping services  array matrices and assay reagents 
we expect product mix will continue to affect our future gross margins 
we also expect our total cost of product and service revenue to increase in the next year as we sell additional products  but to decrease as a percent of product and service revenue due to gains in manufacturing efficiencies and the sale of a larger proportion of higher margin products 
research and development expenses year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  laboratory supplies and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
we expense our research and development expenses as they are incurred 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the cost of beadarray research activities decreased million as compared to the year ended december  the decrease occurred primarily as a result of completing the development of new products launched in the beadchip  an additional microarray platform  a gene expression application on both our array matrix and beadchip platforms and a benchtop snp genotyping system  the beadstation  for performing moderate scale genotyping 
in addition  as we completed development efforts and increased our beadarray driven product sales  a smaller portion of our manufacturing resources was charged to research and development expense in than in research to support our oligator technology platform decreased million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decline is primarily due to higher development expenses incurred in the first quarter of for a major upgrade of our oligator technology  which resulted in a significant increase in our manufacturing capacity 
in the second quarter of  we implemented additional oligator manufacturing enhancements to expand capacity  increase throughput  and further reduce operating costs 
we expect that our research and development expenses will remain relatively flat over the next months 
stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing  finance  human resources  business development and general management  as well as professional fees  such as expenses for legal and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of this increase is related to higher legal expenses  which is primarily due to legal proceedings regarding the disputes with applied biosystems 
approximately million of the increase is due to higher sales and marketing costs  of which million is attributable to personnel related expenses while the majority of the remaining million is attributable to an increase in facility related expenses 
during  we 
table of contents significantly expanded our sales and marketing resources to support the direct sale of our new products  including establishing additional sales operations in japan and singapore 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will accelerate as we expand our staff  add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support the commercialization and support of an increasing number of products 
stock based compensation related to selling  general and administrative employees  directors and consultants was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  amortization of deferred compensation and other stock based compensation charges year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands amortization of deferred compensation and other stock based compensation charges from our inception through july   in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees  founders and directors  we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million  representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was sold 
we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders equity and amortize the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and options 
we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees  founders and directors  using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
for consultants  deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and is periodically re measured and expensed in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we expect amortization of deferred compensation to decrease in due to the nature of the accelerated depreciation methodology as the options near the end of their vesting period 
litigation judgment year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands litigation judgment a million charge was recorded in june to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
we believe that the termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was unsupported by evidence presented at the trial 
we plan to vigorously defend our position on appeal 
a notice of appeal in this case was filed on october   and the appeal process is ongoing 
during the appeal process  the court requires us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case is resolved 
for the years ended december  and december   we recorded litigation expense of  and  respectively  for interest 

table of contents interest income year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease is due to lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective interest rates 
interest expense year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands interest expense interest expense was million for the years ended december  and december  interest expense relates primarily to a million fixed rate loan related to the purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december  and december   and accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset  as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section and of the internal revenue code  and similar state provisions  as a result of changes in our ownership structure 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands product revenue service revenue research revenue total revenue revenue for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
product revenue increased to million in from million in  mostly due to higher sales of oligonucleotides 
snp genotyping service revenue was million in compared to million in as a result of several contracts that were signed during  was the first year of operations for our services and we experienced limited revenues 
government grants and other research funding increased to million for the year ended decem

cost of product and service revenue year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands cost of product and service revenue cost of product and service revenue for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the increase was driven by the increased sales of products and services 
gross margins on product and service revenues were in  versus in  driven by a more favorable cost structure in oligo manufacturing 
research and development year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands research and development research and development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses was driven primarily by higher headcount  related personnel costs and higher laboratory and manufacturing supplies required to continue development of our beadarray technology  which is the underlying technology on which illumina was founded 
during the year ended december   the research expense to support our beadarray activities increased million over the same period in these additional research and development expenses were related to activities such as exploring and optimizing assays for various types of genetic analysis experiments  increasing the multiplexing level of our arrays  continuing development of our arrays and the scanning instrumentation required to read arrays and building up and optimizing our snp genotyping services system 
research to support our oligator technology platform increased million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  during  we introduced upgrades to our oligator technology that significantly increased capacity and quality while reducing manufacturing cost 
stock based compensation related to research and development employees and consultants was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  a portion of this increase is due to higher legal expenses related to a termination of employment lawsuit as well as higher legal expenses related to securing patents 
the remaining increase was due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required to expand and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and snp genotyping services operations 

table of contents stock based compensation related to selling  general and administrative employees  directors and consultants was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  amortization of deferred compensation and other stock based compensation charges year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands amortization of deferred compensation and other stock based compensation charges in connection with the grant of stock options and sale of restricted common stock to employees  founders and directors through july   we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million 
we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
interest income year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
interest income decreased in due to lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective interest rates 
interest expense year ended year ended december  december  change in thousands interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a million loan related to the purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments including restricted cash and investments of  of approximately million 
in addition  we had long term restricted investments of million 
we currently invest our funds in us dollar based investment grade corporate and government debt securities with average maturities of approximately months 
our operating activities used cash of million in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities in was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of million reduced by non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization and non cash charges of million for amortization of deferred stock compensation 
net cash used in operating activities in was primarily the result of a net loss from operations of million reduced by an million increase in accrued litigation judgment  non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization and non cash charges of million for amortization of deferred stock compensation 

table of contents our investing activities provided cash of million in the year ended december  as compared to cash used of million in the year ended december  cash provided in investing activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to the sale or maturity of investment securities used to provide operating funds for our business  while cash used in the year ended december  was due primarily to the purchase of a new facility offset by maturities of investment securities 
capital expenditures were million in and are expected to increase to million in our financing activities provided million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  resulted primarily from million in loan proceeds related to the purchase of our new facility 
in june  we recorded a million charge to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
as a result of our decision to appeal the ruling  we filed a surety bond with the court on october  of times the judgment amount  or approximately million 
under the terms of the bond  we are required to maintain a letter of credit for of the bond amount to secure the bond 
further  we were required to deposit approximately million of marketable securities as collateral for the letter of credit and accordingly  these funds will be restricted from use for corporate purposes until the appeal process is completed 
if a judgment is due  we expect payment will occur within to months 
as of the end of  we had funding remaining under existing nih grants of approximately million  including million available under the international hapmap project 
all of these amounts are scheduled to be paid in  subject to the actual amount of activities we perform under these grants 
based on our current operating plans  we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents  investments  revenues from sales and funding from grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs for at least to months 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
at the current time  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
however  our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize our snp genotyping laboratory and gene expression systems and extensions to those products and to expand our oligonucleotide and snp genotyping services product lines  scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with applied biosystems and the successful resolution of our appeal in a termination of employment lawsuit 
therefore  we may require additional funding within this time frame and the additional funding  if needed  may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights 
on december   we filed a shelf registration statement that would allow us to raise up to million of funding through the sale of common stock in one or more transactions 
we currently do not have formal arrangements to sell securities under the registration statement  but if market and other business conditions become favorable within the next several months  we could put such arrangements in place and attempt to raise at least a portion of the funds covered by the registration statement 
contractual obligations in april  we entered into a million loan arrangement to be used at our discretion to finance purchases of capital equipment  million of which remains available at december  in january  we purchased two newly constructed buildings and assumed a million  year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of which calls for principal and interest 
table of contents payments of approximately million per year until the loan expires in january at which time a balloon payment of million will be due 
we also lease office space under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various times through december these leases contain renewal options ranging from to years 
as of december   our contractual obligations are in thousands  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidelines established by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
under sab  revenue cannot be recorded until all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue consists of sales of oligonucleotides  array matrices  assay reagents  genotyping systems and gene expression systems 
services revenue consists of revenue received for performing genotyping services 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer  provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
beadlab genotyping system revenue is recognized when earned  which is generally upon shipment  installation  training and fulfillment of contractually defined acceptance criteria 
reserves are provided for anticipated product warranty expenses at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
revenue for genotyping services is recognized generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered to the customer 
we have been awarded million from the national institutes of health to perform genotyping services in connection with the international hapmap project 
a portion of the revenue from this project is earned at the time the related costs are incurred while the remainder of the revenue is earned upon the delivery of genotyping data 
research revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
all revenues are recorded net of any applicable allowances for returns or discounts 
we received million of non refundable research funding from applied biosystems in connection with a licensing and development contract entered into in this amount was originally recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with the provisions of sab and would have been recognized as revenue at a contractually defined rate of of the defined operating profit earned from sales of the products covered by the collaboration agreement  had such sales occurred 
at present  we do not believe a collaboration product will be commercialized under the partnership agreement  and there are legal proceedings between the parties as more fully described in item  legal proceedings 
the million of research funding has been reclassified to an advance payment from former collaborator until the legal proceedings have been resolved 
cash investments 
we invest our excess cash balances in marketable debt securities  primarily government securities and corporate bonds and notes  with strong credit ratings 
we classify our investments as available for sale under sfas and record such investments at the estimated fair value in the balance sheet  with gains and losses  if any  reported in stockholders equity 
we periodically review our investments for other than temporary impairment 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb emerging issues task force issued its consensus concerning revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the identified accounting units

table of contents factors affecting our operating results in addition to the items mentioned above  the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 
we have generated only a small amount of revenue from product and service offerings to date 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur net losses 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  and we incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended december  we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future 
the magnitude of our net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  of our revenue and on the level of our expenses 
we expect to continue incurring significant expenses for research and development  for developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products 
in addition  we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase at a higher rate in the future as a result of the launch of our beadlab and beadstation snp genotyping system and gene expression systems 
as a result  we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and  consequently  we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability 
even if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our success depends upon the increasing availability of genetic information and the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and function 
we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries 
the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease 
we are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and function  namely snp genotyping and gene expression profiling 
our first products are being sold into the snp genotyping and focused gene expression markets 
both of these markets are new and emerging  and they may not develop as quickly as we anticipate  or reach their full potential 
other methods of analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing 
also  researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and function 
if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not develop in a timely manner  demand for our products may grow at a slower rate than we expect  and we may never become profitable 
we are an early stage company with a limited history of commercial sales of systems and consumable products  and our success depends on our ability to develop commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our new and unproven technologies 
we may not possess all of the resources  capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies 
we only recently sold our first genotyping systems  and some of our other technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development 
you should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting an early stage company developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries 
we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale 
problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services 
in addition  we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services 

table of contents historically  life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of technologies 
compared to the existing technologies  our technologies are new and relatively unproven 
in order to be successful  our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate to potential customers the benefits and cost effectiveness of our products and services relative to others available in the market  the extent and effectiveness of our efforts to market  sell and distribute our products  our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and reliability and at an acceptable cost  and the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new technologies requiring capital investments 
we have limited experience in manufacturing commercial products and services 
we have limited experience manufacturing our products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales 
we have only recently begun manufacturing products on a commercial scale and operating our internal snp genotyping service product line 
for example  in the past we have experienced variations in manufacturing conditions that have temporarily reduced production yields 
due to the intricate nature of manufacturing products that contain dna  we may encounter similar or previously unknown manufacturing difficulties in the future that could significantly reduce production yields  impact our ability to sell these products  or to produce them economically  may prevent us from achieving expected performance levels or cause us to set prices that hinder wide adoption by customers 
if we are unable to develop our manufacturing capability  we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner  or at all 
we currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use 
if a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail  these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services 
if we are unable to find third party manufacturers to manufacture components of our products  we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner  or at all 
the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources 
for example  we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles and beadchip slides included in our products from single vendors 
if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of those or other product components  we will be unable to meet demand for our products 
we may need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercial scale production of some of our products  or develop these capabilities internally  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis  for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms 
accordingly  we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable  high volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 
our current sales  marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products 
we currently have limited sales and marketing and technical support services and have only recently established a small direct sales force and customer support team 
in order to effectively 
table of contents commercialize our genotyping and gene expression systems and other products to follow  we will need to expand our sales  marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally 
we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services 
in addition  we compete primarily with much larger companies  that have larger sales and distribution staffs and a significant installed base of products in place  and the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance of our products required to support continued growth of our business 
we expect intense competition in our target markets  which could render our products obsolete or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 
this would limit our ability to compete and achieve profitability 
if we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products  our revenues may not grow as intended 
we compete with life sciences companies that design  manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and function and other applications using technologies such as two dimensional electrophoresis  capillary electrophoresis  mass spectrometry  flow cytometry  microfluidics  and mechanically deposited  inkjet and photolithographic arrays 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  emerging competition and new product introductions 
for example  we expect affymetrix to release a k snp genotyping chip and several competitors have begun selling a single chip for whole human genome expression which may compete with our snp genotyping service and product offerings and our gene expression product offerings 
one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical 
our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources  broader product lines  a more established customer base and more experience in research and development than we have 
furthermore  the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies  which are our potential customers and strategic partners  could develop competing products 
if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth 
these difficulties could increase our losses 
we expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans  which will place a strain on our human and capital resources 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our losses could increase 
our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees 
if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner  or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls  then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology 
failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 
any inability to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries 
if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately  competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad 
these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 

table of contents the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries  including our patent position  generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products  as we deem appropriate 
however  our patent applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
in april  applied biosystems served us with an amended complaint alleging patent infringement  asserting that our genotyping products infringe several patents owned by applied biosystems 
others may challenge or invalidate our patents or claim that we infringe the rights of third party patents  however  we are not aware of any other such parties that currently intend to pursue patent infringement claims against us 
also  our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  or litigate against third party claims  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace 
we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information 
these measures  however  may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or services 
our commercial success depends in part on our non infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property 
applied biosystems has served us with an amended complaint alleging patent infringement and other third parties have or may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
in addition  third parties have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents 
we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims 
we may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents against others 
furthermore  parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief  which effectively could block our ability to further develop  commercialize and sell products  and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us  we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties  or be prohibited from selling certain products 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost  or at all 
in that event  we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from commercializing available products  and the prohibition of sale of any of our products could materially affect our ability to grow and to attain profitability 

table of contents we may need additional capital in the future 
if additional capital is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and services  the need for capital expenditures to support and expand our business  the progress and scope of our research and development projects  the filing  prosecution and enforcement of patent claims  the success of our legal proceedings with applied biosystems and the appeal of a wrongful termination lawsuit 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for at least to months 
however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than an equipment lease line with million unused and available as of december  to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to achieve our goals 
we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel  including jay flatley  our president and chief executive officer  david barker  our vice president and chief scientific officer  and john stuelpnagel  our senior vice president of operations 
the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology  chemistry  biological information processing  sales  marketing and technical support 
we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other life science companies  universities and research institutions  particularly those focusing on genomics 
competition for these individuals  particularly in the san diego area  is intense  and the turnover rate can be high 
failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies 
our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies  including the life sciences and healthcare industries 
thus  we will need to add new personnel  including management  and develop the expertise of existing management 
the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 
a significant portion of our sales are to international customers 
approximately million of our revenues were derived from customers outside the united states 
we intend to continue to expand our international presence and export sales to international customers and we expect the total amount of non us sales to continue to grow 
export sales entail a variety of risks  including currency exchange fluctuations  unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements of foreign countries into which we import our products  
table of contents difficulties in obtaining export licenses or other trade barriers and restrictions resulting in delivery delays  and significant taxes or other burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
in addition  sales to international customers typically result in longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political  social and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relations 
one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we expect that our results of operations will fluctuate 
this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 
a significant portion of our current revenue is derived from a few large  individual transactions such as the sale of production genotyping systems and large genotyping services contracts  including our work on the international hapmap project 
because these transactions do not occur regularly and there is a lengthy sales cycle for such transactions  revenue of these types may not occur on a consistent or frequent basis 
in addition  our total amount of revenues is subject to fluctuations in demand from seasonality impacts  the timing and amount of us government grant funding programs  the timing and size of research projects our customers perform and changes in overall spending levels in the life sciences industry 
given the difficulty in predicting the timing and magnitude of sales for our products  we may experience quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenue resulting in the potential for a sequential decline in quarterly revenue 
a large portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel 
in addition  we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly 
accordingly  if revenue does not grow as anticipated  we may not be able to reduce our operating losses 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses  we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
if our operating results fluctuate or do not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  our stock price probably would decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
our equipment financings  amounting to million as of december   are all at fixed rates and therefore  have no exposure to changes in interest rates 
in january  we assumed a million mortgage in connection with the purchase of a new facility and related land 
the interest rate on this loan is fixed for a year period and consequently there is no exposure to increasing market interest rates 
we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  nor do we have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place
