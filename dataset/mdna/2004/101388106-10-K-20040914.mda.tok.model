the company presents non gaap financial measures which exclude certain acquisition related items specifically in process research and development charges  amortization of intangible assets  stock compensation expense and expenses associated with warrants issued because the company s management believes it is a more accurate measurement of bottomline s overall operating performance 
the company uses these same measures internally in evaluating and assessing the operating performance of the company 
the other data is not a gaap measurement of financial performance and should not be used as substitute for our results reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

you should carefully review those factors and also carefully review the risks outlined in other documents that we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we provide a comprehensive set of solutions for financial business process management fbpm 
our solutions are designed for a wide range of businesses from single site to large multi site enterprises 
our products are sold on either a perpetual license or subscription basis 
in fiscal year  we improved our operating results through revenue growth and management of expenses 
our revenue increased from million to million 
the revenue increase was attributable to our acquisition of create form during the year and foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we derived approximately of our revenue through international subsidiaries 
we expect revenue to grow approximately in fiscal year and see potential for further revenue growth through market opportunities such as the bacstel ip conversion currently underway in the united kingdom 
our net loss decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this decrease was principally due to the absence  in fiscal year  of a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year along with improved overall operating results in fiscal year our fiscal year results include approximately million of acquisition related charges in the form of amortization of intangible assets million  in process research and development  and stock compensation expense 
we expect net income to be between million and million in fiscal year revenue sources our revenues are primarily derived from the following three sources software license fees 
software license revenues  which we derive from our software applications  are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased 
fees from the sale of software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer 
however  certain of our software arrangements  primarily those involving nettransact and webseries electronic banking  are often recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project because they require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods 

table of contents service and maintenance fees 
we derive service and maintenance revenues from consulting  design  project management and training fees  customer support and maintenance fees  customer specific customization of our products  and transactional service fees from our legal exchange product and our other transactional based product offerings 
revenues relating to custom consulting  design and service fees are normally recognized at the time services are rendered 
software maintenance fees are established as a percentage  typically  of the list price for the software license  and are prepaid annually 
support and maintenance agreements generally have a term of months  renewable annually  and we recognize revenue related to customer support and maintenance fees ratably over the applicable maintenance period 
professional services revenues associated with software license arrangements that include significant customization and modification are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project 
revenues relating to our webseries legal e billing product and our other transactional based product offerings are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
certain of our offerings  particularly our outsourced and transactional service offerings  require customers to pay a non refundable set up or installation fee 
in such cases  since the up front payment does not reflect a separate earnings process by bottomline  these fees are deferred and are recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the customer relationship  which is generally not more than four years 
equipment and supplies revenues 
we derive equipment and supplies revenues from the sale of printers  check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners 
these revenues are normally recognized at the time of delivery 
equipment and supplies revenue also includes postage and shipping related charges billed to customers 
reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance 
we refer to such policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate  and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used 
these critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition and goodwill and intangible assets 
these critical policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are discussed below 
in addition  refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of software licenses  professional services  software maintenance and equipment and supplies 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we consider a non cancelable fully executed agreement or customer purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to have occurred upon transfer of product title to the customer  or completion of services rendered 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to adjustment  or if we have not granted extended payment terms to the customer excluding our long term contract arrangements for which revenue is recorded on a percentage of completion basis  our normal payment terms do not exceed days 
we consider collection to be probable if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay amounts as they become due under the arrangement 
our sales arrangements can contain multiple revenue elements  such as software licenses  professional services  and software maintenance 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element treatment is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
revenue allocated to the software element is based on the residual method  under which revenue equal to the fair value of professional services and software support is allocated to those items and recognized as revenue as those items are delivered 
any residual or remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license element 
revenue is recognized for each element when the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain of our software development arrangements require significant customization and modification and extended implementation periods 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment  as described above  and instead must be accounted for under contract accounting 
under contract accounting  companies must select from two generally 
table of contents accepted methods of accounting the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method 
the completed contract method recognizes revenue only upon contract completion  and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue on a contract as the work progresses  as a percentage of cumulative costs incurred compared to the total estimated project costs 
we have historically used the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long term and custom contracts  since we believe that we can make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion 
progress is measured based on cumulative costs incurred  as measured at the end of each reporting period  as a percentage of total expected project costs 
accordingly  the revenue we record in any reporting period for sales arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining costs that will be incurred in fulfilling our contractual obligations 
our estimates of total contract costs at the end of any reporting period could prove to be materially different from final actual contract costs  as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion 
to mitigate this risk  we solicit the input of our project professional staff on a monthly basis  as well as at the end of each reporting period  for purposes of evaluating estimates toward completion  so that our estimates are always based on the most recent cost projections available 
goodwill and intangible assets effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas relating to goodwill and intangible assets 
we were required to perform a transitional impairment test upon adoption to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
based on the results of this impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with goodwill in the bottomline europe reporting unit 
this amount was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
we utilized an outside valuation firm to assist us in calculating the required fair value amounts in connection with our impairment review 
the principal component of each fair value calculation is the determination of discounted future cash flows  and there are a number of variables that we considered for purposes of projecting these future cash flows 
there is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process  and  while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions  the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time 
the particularly sensitive components of these estimates include  but are not limited to the selection of an appropriate discount rate  the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams  our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue  our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  the level of bottomline us products that will be sold by bottomline europe  our software product life cycles  the attrition rate of our customers  particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams such as software maintenance  our planned level of operating expenses  and our effective tax rate 
the use of different assumptions or projections  in some or all of the areas noted above  would likely have resulted in different fair value results  thus affecting our determination of overall goodwill impairment 
we are required to test our goodwill at least annually for impairment and we performed this review during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
based on our fourth quarter review  we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment 
at june   our goodwill carrying value was million in our us reporting unit and million in our uk reporting unit 
there can be no assurance that there will not be additional impairment charges recorded in subsequent periods as a result of our periodic impairment reviews 

table of contents in addition to our goodwill review  we also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value of our other intangible assets 
these intangible assets consist of acquired core technology  and customer related intangibles such as acquired customer lists and customer contracts 
we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present  including whether there has been a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  whether there has been a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life 
if indicators of impairment are present  an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made  to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered 
these estimates involve significant subjectivity  similar to that which accompanies our goodwill valuation process 
at june   the carrying value of our intangible assets  excluding goodwill  was million 
none of these assets were deemed to be impaired 
valuation of acquired intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of createform in september and our acquisition of albion business machines ltd 
abm in may  we recorded in process research and development charges of  and  and recorded several other intangible assets relating to acquired core technology and customer related intangible assets 
the valuation process used to calculate the values assigned to the in process research and development and the acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimates relative to our financial projections 
accordingly  we utilized an outside valuation firm to assist us in determining these values 
the principal component of the valuation is the determination of discounted future cash flows  and there are a number of variables that we considered for purposes of projecting these future cash flows 
there is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process  and  while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions  the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time 
further  the projections required for the valuation process normally require a ten year forecast  which exceeds our normal internal planning and forecasting timeline 
the particularly sensitive components of these estimates include  but are not limited to the selection of an appropriate discount rate  the required return on all assets employed by the valued asset to generate future income streams  our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue  our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  our technology and product life cycles  the attrition rate of our customers  particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams such as software maintenance  our planned level of operating expenses  and our effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the guidance of eitf is applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  fiscal for us and companies are permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the adoption of eitf on july  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when a liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires new disclosures related to guarantees 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin were effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  additionally  new disclosure requirements applicable to all guarantees subject to the scope of fin  including guarantees that arose prior to december   are effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  however  we have modified the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements as required by the pronouncement 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas provides for alternative methods of voluntary transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and it requires more prominent disclosures  in both interim and annual financial statements  about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported financial results 
sfas is effective for interim periods beginning after december   and for annual periods ending after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements since we elected to continue to account for our stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb however  we have modified the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 and in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 collectively fin  both of which address consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other interests in the entity 
previously  entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise only when it had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority of the voting interests in the entity 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply to variable interest entities created after january  and to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires an issuer to classify specified financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity as liabilities that were previously classified either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the statement of financial position 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the issuance of sab reflects the concepts contained in eitf  the other revenue recognition concepts contained in sab remain largely unchanged 
the adoption of sab during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on eitf no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which sets forth a basic model to evaluate whether investments within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  are other than temporarily impaired 
the guidance of eitf will be applied prospectively to all current and future investments in interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  fiscal for us 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

revenues  based on the point of sale rather than the location of the customer  were million in the us  million in the uk and million in australia for the fiscal year ended june  revenues based on the point of sale for the fiscal year ended june  were million in the us and million in the uk 

table of contents software licenses 
the increase in software license revenues was due principally to the contribution of revenue from createform and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in license fees from our legacy payment products and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in our webseries licenses in the us 
based on current plans  we anticipate that software license revenues will increase in fiscal year service and maintenance 
the increase in service and maintenance revenues in dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due principally to an increase in professional service and transaction revenues generated from customers who utilize our webseries and legal exchange products in the us  the contribution of professional services and software maintenance revenues generated by createform  an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk and an increase in professional services associated with a large contract in the uk 
the increase in service and maintenance revenues was partially offset by a decrease in the professional services associated with our legacy products in the us as a result of declining software license fees on those products 
based on current plans  we anticipate that service and maintenance revenues will increase in fiscal year equipment and supplies 
the decrease in equipment and supplies revenues in dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due principally to the continued migration of us and uk customers to our web based products and solutions  which are not equipment and supplies intensive  offset in part by an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk

software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and related documentation and costs of licensing third party software that is incorporated into or sold with certain of our legacy products 
software license costs decreased to of software license revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in software license cost of revenues was due primarily to the decrease in software products licensed in the uk  which have historically had a higher cost of sale due in part to third party software which is incorporated into and sold with these products  partially offset by an increase in software license cost of revenues associated with the sale of createform software 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year software license costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal year levels 
service and maintenance 
service and maintenance costs include salaries and other related costs for our customer service  maintenance and help desk support staffs  as well as third party contractor expenses used to complement our professional services team 
service and maintenance costs decreased to of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of service and maintenance revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in service and maintenance costs was attributable to reduced personnel costs resulting from headcount reductions in both the us and uk and reduced costs on several long term revenue contracts in the us  offset by expenses associated with createform personnel and an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year service and maintenance costs  as a percentage of revenues  will decrease from fiscal levels 
equipment and supplies 
equipment and supplies costs include the costs associated with equipment and supplies that we resell  as well as freight  shipping and postage costs associated with the delivery of our products 
equipment and supplies costs increased to of equipment and supplies revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of equipment and supplies revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in equipment and supplies costs as a percentage of equipment and supplies revenue was attributable to reduced profit margins in the uk  resulting principally from an increase in shipping and postage costs which carry no gross margin and due to reduced profit margins in the us  resulting from selling price pressures on equipment and supplies that we resell to our customers 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year equipment and supplies costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal year levels

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations  marketing materials and trade shows 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was attributable to the operations of createform and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in personnel costs as a result of headcount reductions in the us and uk 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will decrease  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year product development and engineering 
product development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development  which continues to be focused on enhancements and revisions to our products based on customer feedback and general marketplace demands 
the decrease in product development and engineering expenses was primarily the result of decreased personnel costs as a result of reduced headcount primarily in the us and  to a lesser extent  in the uk  offset in part by product development and engineering expenses attributable to createform  increased contract labor costs and reduced utilization of research and development personnel on billable customer projects  the cost of which is classified as a component of cost of revenues 
we anticipate that product development and engineering expenses will decrease  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year in process research and development 
in process research and development of  in the fiscal year ended june  represents the expense associated with acquired in process research and development of createform of  and abm of  there was no comparable expense in the fiscal year ended june  the in process research and development projects were valued using an income approach  which included the application of a discounted cash flow methodology 
using this methodology  the value of in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the future cash flow stream attributable to this technology over its anticipated life 
as a basis for the valuation process  we made estimates of the revenue stream to be generated in each future period and the corresponding operating expenses and other charges  such as income taxes  that will be incurred to support this revenue stream 
based upon these assumptions  the projected cash flow streams relating to the in process research and development were discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
stock compensation expense 
in connection with our acquisition of flashpoint in august  we assumed all of the outstanding common stock options of flashpoint  which were exchanged for our common stock options  and recorded deferred compensation of million at the date of acquisition relating to the intrinsic value of the unvested options 
the deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of the options 
the decrease in stock compensation expense was due principally to the forfeiture of unvested stock options as a result of employee separations 
the remaining unamortized deferred compensation balance of  at june  will be fully amortized during fiscal year general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was the result of the expense contribution from createform and an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk  partially offset by lower personnel costs in the us and in the uk resulting from headcount reductions and reduced facility costs in the us as a result of closing certain offices 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal year 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization expense was due principally to certain intangible assets of bottomline europe that became fully amortized in the three months ended september  we anticipate approximately million of amortization expense for the fiscal year other income expense  net fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands in thousands interest income interest expense other  net other income expense  net interest income 
the decrease in interest income was attributable to a decrease in the rate of return  due to declining interest rates  on our investments during fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense relates predominantly to interest associated with a promissory note that we assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of evelocity in may the third and final principal and interest payment on this promissory note was made on february other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses and losses on our equity investments 
the other income expense  net included impairment losses on our equity investments  which we judged to be other than temporary  in the amounts of  and  in the fiscal years ended june  and june  the investments are in non public entities accounted for under the cost method 
the carrying value of all of our equity investments was approximately  at june  and  at june  provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes consists of a small amount of us state tax expense  which will be incurred irrespective of our net operating loss position  and a provision for income taxes in australia 
for the fiscal year ended june   our income tax loss carry back had been fully utilized 
accordingly  we have maintained a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets since  based on the available evidence  we believe that our deferred tax assets are less likely  rather than more likely  to be realized 
net loss 
the decrease in the net loss was primarily due to the contribution of revenue from createform  an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate in the uk  cost control initiatives undertaken in recent fiscal years and the adoption of sfas under which goodwill is no longer subject to recurring amortization 
we anticipate generating net income in fiscal year  principally as the result of higher revenue and lower amortization expense

operating expenses fiscal year ended june  increase decrease between periods compared to in thousands in thousands operating expenses sales and marketing product development and engineering product development and engineering stock compensation expense general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in the us as a result of a reduction in salaries and commissions  resulting from reduced headcount and lower revenues  particularly software revenues 
these reductions were partially offset by employee severance and separation related costs as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in the us and in the uk during the first six months of fiscal year and by an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate of the uk 
product development and engineering 
the decrease in product development and engineering expenses was due to a reduction in salaries and employee related costs as a result of reduced us headcount and a shift in focus for certain us personnel from core development work to billable customer work  the cost of which is classified as a component of cost of revenues

cumulative effect of accounting change 
upon adoption of sfas on july   we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with impairment of goodwill in the bottomline europe reporting unit 
this amount has been reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  as required by sfas  in the fiscal year ended june  there were no comparable items in the year ended june  net loss 
the decrease in the net loss was primarily due to the adoption of sfas under which goodwill is no longer subject to recurring amortization  offset by a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities and the sale of our common stock 
we had net working capital of million at june   including cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
we have generated positive operating cash flows in each of our last three fiscal years 
we believe that the cash generated from our operations and the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand  particularly given that we have no long term debt obligations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
we also may receive additional investments from  and make investments in  customers or other companies

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision involving our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
if the independence status of our auditors  ernst young llp  is not resolved favorably and in a timely manner  we will lose our status as a timely filer for sec purposes and may be required to seek another auditor on september   we were informed by ernst young that it intends to seek the guidance of the staff of the securities and exchange commission regarding whether its independence as our auditors may be affected as a result of an immaterial investment by a substantial stockholder of ours in an unrelated company in which an affiliate of ernst young already held an immaterial investment 
ernst young has advised us that it is unable to furnish its report on our financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  until this matter is resolved and that it is seeking guidance from the sec staff on this issue as promptly as possible 
therefore  on september   we filed a form b with respect to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   as we could not have timely filed the information required by item of form k without unreasonable effort or expense 
if we are unable to file the information required by item of form k by september   the fifteenth calendar day following the prescribed due date of our annual report on form k  we will lose our status as a timely filer for sec purposes which will mean  among other things  that our security holders will not be able to make resales of our securities under rule and that we will not be able to utilize registration statements on form s or form s in addition  if the independence status of ernst young is not resolved in a manner favorable to us  we will be required to seek another auditor and the filing of our annual report on form k will be further delayed 
our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo extreme market price and volume fluctuations stock markets in general  and the nasdaq stock market in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in recent years 
broad market fluctuations of this type may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that often have been unrelated to their operating performance 
the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo extreme fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including general and industry specific business  economic and market conditions  actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  including those arising as a result of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets related to past or future acquisitions  changes in or our failure to meet analysts or investors estimates or expectations  public announcements concerning us  including announcements of litigation  our competitors or our industry  introductions of new products or services or announcements of significant contracts by us or our competitors  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  or capital commitments by us or our competitors  adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights  and announcements of technological innovations by our competitors 
our fixed costs may lead to operating results below analyst or investor expectations if our revenues are below anticipated levels  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock a significant percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel and facilities costs  are relatively fixed and based in part on anticipated revenue levels 
we have recently experienced slowing growth rates due to the challenging economic climate in the technology arena 
a decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expense growth could negatively affect our business 
significant revenue shortfalls in any quarter may cause significant declines in operating results since we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner 
quarterly operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
factors that could cause fluctuations in our operating results include the following economic conditions  which may affect our customers and potential customers budgets for information technology expenditures  the timing of orders and longer sales cycles  particularly due to the increased average sales price of our software solutions  the timing of product implementations  which are highly dependent on customers resources and discretion  the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software products and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies or businesses  and the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by either us or our competitors 
because of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 

table of contents our mix of products and services could have a significant effect on our financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock our products and services have considerably varied gross margins 
our software revenues generally yield significantly higher gross margins than do our service  maintenance  and equipment and supplies revenue streams 
in recent fiscal years we experienced a decrease in our software license fees  particularly in the us  as a result of the continued slowdown in overall it spending 
if software license fees continue to decline or if the mix of our products and services in any given period does not match our expectations  our results of operations and the market price of our common stock could be significantly affected 
as a result of our acquisitions  we could be subject to significant future write offs with respect to intangible assets  which may adversely affect our future operating results in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
effective july  we adopted sfas  which required us to perform a transitional impairment test on all indefinite lived intangible assets 
in connection with our transition to sfas  we recorded an impairment charge of million in relation to the goodwill of our bottomline europe reporting unit 
at june   the carrying value of our goodwill and our other intangible assets was million and million  respectively 
while we reviewed our goodwill during our fourth quarter and concluded that there was no impairment  we could be subject to future impairment charges with respect to these intangible assets  or intangible assets arising as a result of additional acquisitions in future periods 
such charges  to the extent occurring  would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our financial condition and results of operations in recent periods  a significant percentage of our revenues have been generated by our international operations  and our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on our continued growth and success in international markets 
as a result of the createform acquisition  we now have operations in australia  in addition to the us and the uk 
as is the case with most international operations  the success and profitability of such operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include  in addition to the risks our business as a whole faces  the following difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  differing regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements  the complexities of foreign tax jurisdictions  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and import or export licensing requirements 
a significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from our payment management offerings and our performance will depend on continued market acceptance of these solutions a significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from the license and maintenance of our payment management offerings and sales of associated products and services 
any significant reduction in demand for our payment management offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future performance could depend on the following factors continued market acceptance of our payment management offerings as a payment management solution  prospective customers dependence upon enterprises seeking to enhance their payment functions to integrate electronic payment capabilities  our ability to introduce enhancements to meet the market s evolving needs for secure payments and cash management solutions  and continued acceptance of desktop and enterprise software  and laser check printing solutions 

table of contents our future financial results will be affected by the acceptance of electronic invoice presentment product offerings in an emerging market our electronic invoice presentment business model is in the early stages of market adoption  even though the product has been generally available from us and our competitors for some time 
customers and potential customers may not be ready to adopt our electronic invoice presentment business model  or may be slower to adopt the model than we  or the public market analysts  anticipate 
if this emerging market does not adopt our business model or the market does not respond as quickly as we expect  our future results could be materially and adversely affected 
we face significant competition in our targeted markets  including competition from companies with significantly greater resources in recent years we have encountered increasing competition in our targeted markets 
we compete with a wide range of companies  ranging from small start up enterprises with limited resources  which compete principally on the basis of technology features or specific customer relationships  to large companies  which can leverage significant customer bases and financial resources 
given the size and nature of our targeted markets  the implementation of our growth strategy and our success in competing for market share generally may be dependent on our ability to grow our sales and marketing capabilities and maintain a critical level of financial resources 
integration of acquisitions could interrupt our business and our financial condition could be harmed we have made several acquisitions of companies and assets in the past  including our acquisitions of createform and abm during fiscal  and may  in the future  acquire or make investments in other businesses  products or technologies 
any acquisition or strategic investment we have made in the past or may make in the future may entail numerous risks  including the following difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel  technologies or products  inadequacy of existing operating  financial and management information systems to support the combined organization or new operations  write offs related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  entrance into markets in which we have no or limited prior experience or knowledge  diversion of management s focus from our core business concerns  dilution to existing stockholders and earnings per share  incurrence of substantial debt  and exposure to litigation from other third parties  including claims related to intellectual property or other assets acquired or liabilities assumed 
any such difficulties encountered as a result of any merger  acquisition or strategic investment could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the slowdown in the economy experienced in recent fiscal years has affected the market for information technology solutions  including our products and services  and if this slowdown continues our future financial results could be materially adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers and potential customers  demand for our products and services has been adversely affected 
in recent years  this has resulted in decreased revenues  particularly software license revenues  and a decline in our historic growth rate 
to date  the us marketplace has been particularly affected but there can be no assurance that this trend will not extend  to the same degree  to the uk marketplace where we also have significant operations 
our future results will be materially and adversely affected if this slowdown continues or worsens and our revenues continue to be adversely impacted 
during recent fiscal years  we implemented several cost reduction initiatives in an attempt to improve our profitability 
if current economic conditions continue or worsen  those cost reductions may prove to be inadequate and we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 

table of contents we depend on key employees who are skilled in e commerce  payment  cash and document management and invoice presentment methodology and internet and other technologies our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key technical employees who are skilled in e commerce  payment methodology and regulation  and internet  database and network technologies 
the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our employees 
while some of our executive officers have employment or retention agreements with us  the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must attract and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge in e commerce  payment  cash and document management and invoice presentment methodology and internet and other technologies we believe that our success is in part dependent upon our ability to attract  hire  train and retain highly skilled technical  sales and marketing  and support personnel  particularly with expertise in e commerce  payment  cash management and invoice methodology and internet and other technologies 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
as a result  we may experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either improved productivity or higher sales prices 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in attracting  recruiting or retaining existing personnel 
based on our experience  it takes an average of nine months for a salesperson to become fully productive 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing the productivity of our sales personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts  or contracts that involve the delivery of services over contractually committed periods  may delay the timing of our revenue recognition and affect our operating results  financial condition and the market price of our stock due to an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts  we have experienced  and will likely continue to experience  delays in the timing of our revenue recognition 
these large and complex customer contracts generally require significant implementation work  product customization and modification resulting in the recognition of revenue over the period of project completion  which normally spans several quarters 
additionally  certain of our products and services are sold on a hosted basis  which can involve contractually defined service periods 
in such cases  revenue is typically recorded over the expected life of the arrangement  rather than at the outset of the arrangement  thus lengthening the period of revenue recognition 
delays in revenue recognition on these contracts could affect our operating results  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our product solutions the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
some competitors in our targeted markets have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources  greater brand recognition and a larger installed customer base than we do 
we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the markets we address 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their product offerings and to offer more comprehensive solutions 
this growing competition may result in price reductions of our products and services  reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced software  services and related products the markets in which we compete are subject to rapid technological change and our success is dependent on our ability to develop new and enhanced software  services and related products that meet evolving market needs 
trends that could have a critical impact on us include the adoption of the newly mandated bacstel ip electronic payment format in the uk marketplace  which refers to the payments technology upgrade mandated by uk bacs bankers automated clearing services  which could cause delay and uncertainty with our customers and potential customers purchase decisions  rapidly changing technology  which could cause our software to become suddenly outdated or could require us to make our products compatible with new database or network systems  evolving industry standards  mandates and laws  such as those mandated by the national automated clearing house association and the association for payment clearing services  and developments and changes relating to the internet that we must address as we maintain existing products and introduce any new products 

table of contents there can be no assurance that technological advances will not cause our technology to become obsolete or uneconomical 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely and successful manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our products could be subject to future legal or regulatory actions  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results our software products and hosted services offerings facilitate the transmission of business documents and information including  in some cases  confidential financial data related to payments  invoices and cash management 
our web based software products  and certain of our hosted services offerings  transmit this data electronically 
while we believe that all of our product and service offerings comply with current regulatory and security requirements  there can be no assurance that future legal or regulatory actions will not impact our product and service offerings 
to the extent that regulatory or legal developments mandate a change in any of our products or services  or alter the demand for or the competitive environment of our products and services  we might not be able to respond to such requirements in a timely or successful manner 
if this were to occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
any unanticipated performance problems or bugs in our product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results if the products that we offer do not continue to achieve market acceptance  our future financial results will be adversely affected 
since many of our software solutions are still in early stages of adoption and since most of our software products are continually being enhanced or further developed in response to general marketplace demands  any unanticipated performance problems or bugs that we have not been able to detect could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  negative publicity regarding us and our products  harm to our customer relationships and exposure to potential liability claims 
in addition  if our products do not enjoy wide commercial success  our long term business strategy will be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could incur substantial costs resulting from warranty claims or product liability claims our software license agreements typically contain provisions that afford customers a degree of warranty protection in the event that our software fails to conform to its written specifications 
these agreements typically contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of warranty and product liability claims 
there is a risk  however  that a court might interpret these terms in a limited way or could hold part or all of these terms to be unenforceable 
furthermore  some of our licenses with our customers are governed by non us law  and there is a risk that foreign law might provide us less or different protection 
while we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  we cannot be sure that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims 
although we have not experienced any material warranty or product liability claims to date  a warranty or product liability claim  whether or not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and our resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and could be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property rights  causing serious harm to our business we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we cannot assure you that our patents  pending applications for patents that may issue in the future  or other intellectual property will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us  or that the patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
we enter into agreements with our employees and customers that seek to limit and protect the distribution of proprietary information 
despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that such rights will remain protected or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights or as a result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
these claims  whether or not meritorious  could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product implementations  develop non infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim 
these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we may incur significant costs from class action litigation as a result of expected volatility in our common stock in the past  companies that have experienced market price volatility of their stock have been the targets of securities class action litigation 
in august  we were named as a party in one of the so called laddering securities class action suits relating to the underwriting of our initial public offering 
we could incur substantial costs and experience a diversion of our management s attention and resources in connection with such litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future financial results will depend on our ability to manage growth effectively in the past  rapid growth has strained our managerial and other resources 
recently  we have experienced slowing growth rates due to challenging economic conditions 
if our historical growth rate resumes  our ability to manage that growth will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our operating  financial and management information systems 
we cannot assure you that our personnel  systems and controls will be adequate to support future growth  if any 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  should it occur  the quality of our services  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to financial risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to cash and cash equivalents 
these investments bear interest at a variable interest rate  which is subject to market changes 
we have not entered into any interest rate swap agreements  or other instruments to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have not had any derivative instruments in the past and do not presently plan to in the future 
our investment portfolio consists of demand deposit accounts  money market mutual funds and high quality debt securities 
due to the short term average maturity of the investment portfolio  a sudden sharp change in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the value of the portfolio 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates  a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively  in our results from operations and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have operations located in the united kingdom  where the functional currency is british pound sterling the pound 
also  since the acquisition of createform on september   we have had operations located in australia where the functional currency is australian dollar 
we have not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions or other instruments to minimize our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations nor do we presently plan to in the future 
foreign currency translation risk based on the current level of our australian operations  our financial results would likely not be significantly affected if the australian dollar experiences significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
however  our operations could be significantly affected if the pound experiences significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
a increase or decrease in the average exchange rate between the pound and the us dollar would result in an increase or decrease to revenue of approximately  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal a increase or decrease in the average exchange rate between the pound and the us dollar would result in an increase or decrease to net loss of approximately  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal foreign currency transaction risk foreign currency transaction gains and losses are generally not significant and our financial results would likely not be significantly affected in the event of a increase or decrease in the average exchange rates between the us dollar  the pound  or the australian dollar
