overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of fully human antibody based therapeutic products 
we believe that our ultimab human antibody development system enables us to rapidly create and develop fully human antibodies for a wide range of diseases  including cancer  inflammation  autoimmune disease and other life threatening and debilitating diseases 
we believe that antibodies are proven candidates for therapeutic products 
to date  the united states food and drug administration  or fda  has approved antibody based therapeutic products for sale in the united states 
in  of these products generated aggregate worldwide sales in excess of billion 
we intend to participate in this market and  to this end  are developing an expanding pipeline of therapeutic antibody products generated through the use of our proprietary ultimab human antibody development technology 
currently  antibody products derived from our ultimab human antibody development technology are in human clinical trials  or have had regulatory applications submitted for such trials 
these antibodies are designed to treat a wide range of diseases  such as cancer including various lymphomas  rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
five of these antibody products are fully owned by medarex mdx phase ii clinical trials  mdx phase ii clinical trials  mdx phase i ii clinical trials  mdx phase i ii clinical trials and mdx phase i clinical trials  for the treatment of cancer  lymphoma and or hiv 
one antibody product for autoimmune disease  mdx phase i ii clinical trials  is being jointly developed with our licensing partner  genmab a s  and four are being developed separately by genmab humax cd phase ii clinical trials for cutaneous t cell lymphoma  humax il phase ii clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis  humax egfr phase i ii clinical trials for head and neck cancer and humax cd phase i ii clinical trials for non hodgkin s lymphoma 
additionally  our licensing partners  including novartis pharma ag and centocor  inc a subsidiary of johnson johnson  among others  are developing a total of seven antibody products for inflammatory and or autoimmune diseases and cancer that are currently in early clinical trials 
we and our partners also have a number of product candidates in preclinical development 
the preceding information regarding the clinical status of antibody products is based on our and our partners public disclosures and other publicly available information 
our revenue is principally derived through the licensing of our fully human antibody technology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the terms of these license agreements typically include potential license fees and a series of potential milestone payments commencing upon the initiation of clinical trials and continuing through commercialization 
these payments may total million to million per product if the antibody receives approval from the fda and equivalent foreign agencies 
we are also entitled to receive royalties on product sales 
additional revenue may be earned from the sales to  and in some cases  the manufacturing of antibodies for our partners  as well as from government grants 
our most significant costs on an annual basis are research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses represent those costs which support the advancement of our product pipeline and primarily consist of personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  research and laboratory supplies  funding of outside research  license and technology access fees  expenses related to antibody manufacturing and clinical trial expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
we may be required to add personnel in the future and incur additional costs as we expand our business activities 
we have a history of operating losses and may not achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
over the next several years  we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to identify  develop and manufacture our potential products  invest in research and move forward with our product development 
our commitment of resources to research and the continued development of our product candidates will require substantial additional funds 
our operating expenses may also increase as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  as additional potential products are selected as clinical candidates for further development and as some of our earlier stage product candidates move into later stage clinical development 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our products progress towards commercialization 
in the absence of substantial revenues from new corporate collaborations or other sources  we will incur substantial operating losses and may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we receive payments from our customers and partners for the sale of antibodies  for licenses to our proprietary technology  for product development services and from the achievement of product development milestones 
these payments are generally non refundable and are reported as deferred revenue until they are recognizable as revenue 
we follow the following principles in recognizing revenue we sell antibodies primarily to partners in the united states and overseas 
revenue from these sales is recognized when the antibodies are shipped 
we receive research fees from the licensing of our proprietary technologies for research and development performed by our customers and partners 
revenue from these research fees is recognized generally over the term of the respective license beginning only after both the license period has begun and the technology has been delivered 
we receive fees for product development services including manufacturing we perform for our customers and partners 
these fees are recognized ratably over the entire period during which the services are performed 
revenue from milestone payments is recognized when each milestone is achieved and when collectibility of such milestone payment is assured 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by the efforts of our partners and include such events as submission of an ind  commencement of phase i  ii or iii clinical trials  submission of a bla and approval of a product 
milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of an agreement 
upon achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations relating to that event 
investments our investment policy calls for investments in fixed income high grade securities such as us corporate debt securities  us treasury obligations and money market funds for which we believe there is not a significant risk of loss 
our primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return consistent with these two objectives 
however  in the course of our business  we have made and may continue to make investments in companies both public and private as part of our strategic collaborations 
investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded other than genmab are classified as marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair market value of investments in our partners whose securities are publicly traded represented less than of total marketable securities as of december   and approximately of total marketable securities as of december  under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
marketable securities will include those securities of debt and publicly traded equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
these securities trade on listed exchanges  therefore  fair value is readily available 
these securities are also subject to an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
under our accounting policy  a decline in the value of our investments is deemed to be other than temporary and such investments are generally considered to be impaired if their value is less than our cost basis for more than six months  or some other applicable period in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investments 
in addition  in connection with our collaborative partnering business  we sometimes make strategic investments in the securities of companies that are privately held 
investments in our partners whose equity is not publicly traded are classified in separate line items in our consolidated balance sheet entitled investments in idm and investments in  and advances to  other partners and were approximately million as of december  these securities are carried at original investment cost 
because these securities are not listed on a financial exchange  the value of these investments is inherently more difficult to estimate than investments in public companies 
we value these investments by using information acquired from industry trends  the management of these companies  financial statements  and other external sources 
based on the information acquired through these sources  we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse changes in financial condition and or operating results of the companies in which we invest that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value may also require an impairment charge in the future 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that have not been previously recorded 
acquired in process technology in process technology expense is determined based on an analysis using risk adjusted cash flows expected to be generated by products that may result from in process technologies which have been acquired 
this analysis includes forecasting future cash flows that are expected to result from the progress made on each in process project prior to the acquisition date 
cash flows are estimated by first forecasting  on a product by product basis  net revenues expected from the sales of the first generation of each in process project and risk adjusting these revenues to reflect the probability of advancing to the next stage of the fda approval process 
the forecast data in the analysis is based on internal product level forecast information maintained by us in the ordinary course of business 
the inputs used in analyzing in process technology is based on assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
appropriate operating expenses are deducted from forecasted net revenues on a product by product basis to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology 
finally  net returns are discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and our company as well as product specific risks associated with the acquired in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors include the product s phase of development  type of antibody under development  likelihood of regulatory approval  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  preclinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile  and development plan 
in addition to the product specific risk factors  a discount rate is used for the valuation  which represents a considerable risk premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
the valuations used to estimate in process technology require us to use significant estimates and assumptions that if changed  may result in a different valuation for in process technology 
results of operations years ended december   and contract and license revenues contract and license revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
contract and license revenues for decreased by million or as compared to this decrease relates primarily to a decrease in revenue of million from kirin as a result of the completion in december of the recognition of revenue associated with a december binding letter of intent and million from idm as a result of the completion in september of the recognition of non cash revenue associated with a transfer of technology to idm in july contract and license revenues for decreased by million or as compared to this decrease relates principally to a decrease in revenue from idm of million as a result of the completion of the recognition of revenue associated with the transfer of technology to idm  as well as a decrease in revenue of million from eli lilly 
because contract and license revenues depend to a large extent on the product development efforts of our partners and licensees  our year to year contract and license revenues can fluctuate significantly and are inherently difficult to predict 
sales  contract and license revenues from genmab sales  contract and license revenues from genmab were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sales  contract and license revenues from genmab for increased by million or as compared to this increase is primarily due to sales of mdx cd and mdx totaling million in to support genmab s clinical trials  offset  in part  by lower contract and license revenues from genmab in there were no sales of such material to genmab in or sales  contract and license revenues from genmab for decreased by million or as compared to as there were no sales of mdx cd and mdx to genmab in this decrease was offset  in part  by increased contract and license revenues from genmab in cost of sales cost of sales were million  million and thousand for the years ended december   and cost of sales increased by million in  or  as compared to the increase primarily reflects the production cost of mdx cd and mdx  which were sold to genmab in cost of sales in decreased by million  as compared to the decrease is a result of no sales of these materials to genmab in as discussed above 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for our products in development were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses in increased by million  or as compared to and research and development expenses in increased by million  or as compared to historically  due to the relatively small number of our products in clinical trials  we have not accounted for our research and development expenses on a project by project basis and  therefore  we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below research and product development and by the types of costs as outlined below 
we separate research and development expenditures on the basis of amounts associated with research and amounts associated with product development 
our research costs consist of costs associated with the breeding  care and continued development of our humab mouse and km mouse  as well as costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the preclinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  research supplies  funding of outside research and license and technology access fees 
our product development costs consist of costs of preclinical development including manufacturing and conducting and administering clinical trials 
such product development costs also include personnel costs  facilities including depreciation  supply expense related to antibody manufacturing and clinical trial expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
year ended december  research product development total research costs research costs in increased by million  or as compared to research costs in increased by million  or as compared to the increases in research costs primarily relate to the following personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increased personnel costs are a result of the increased staff needed to support higher levels of research  the continued development of our ultimab system  and the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners 
personnel costs include primarily salary  benefits  payroll taxes and recruiting costs 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase  but at a slower rate  as we continue to increase our research activities 
facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increase in facility costs primarily relates to the substantial investments made in our research facilities during and as well as a full year of operation of our sunnyvale  california facility in as a result  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  property taxes and related expenses increased for each of and  as compared to the prior year periods 
we expect to incur increased facility costs as a result of continued capital expansion  renovations and replacements but at a slower rate 
research supply costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to research supply costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to included in these costs are materials and small equipment associated with the development of new products 
we expect these costs to increase as we continue to expand our research activities 
funding of outside research in was million  an increase of million or as compared to a credit balance of million for the credit balance for was principally due to the april refund of a million fee previously paid in 
excluding the refund  funding of outside research in and was comparable 
funding of outside research in was million  an increase of million or over funding of outside research includes funds paid to certain partners for research services 
license and technology access fees in were million  an increase of million or as compared to license and technology access fees in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to these costs represent fees paid to certain partners and research organizations in connection with certain of our collaboration and license agreements 
included in the cost are payments to northwest biotherapeutics  tularik and millennium pharmaceuticals for licenses to certain technologies 
we expect license fees  including funds paid to certain partners  to increase in the future 
product development costs product development costs in increased by million  or as compared to product development costs increased by million in  or as compared to the increases in product development costs primarily relate to the following personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increased personnel costs are a result of the increased staff needed to support higher levels of clinical trial manufacturing activities and more extensive clinical trial activities 
personnel costs primarily include salary  benefits  payroll taxes and recruiting costs 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase  but at a slower rate  as we continue to increase our product development activities and progress our products through clinical trials 
facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to facility costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to the increase in facility costs primarily relates to the substantial investments made in our product development facilities during and as a result  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  property taxes and related expenses increased for each of and  as compared to the prior year periods 
we expect to incur increased facility costs as a result of continued capital expansion  renovations and replacements but at a slower rate 
supply costs in were million  an increase of million or as compared to in we manufactured larger quantities of material for phase i and phase ii clinical trials for ourselves and our partners resulting in significant increase in supply costs 
supply costs in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to in we completed a change to our method of production which resulted in comparatively lower supply costs 
included in these costs are materials and small equipment associated with the manufacture of material for clinical trials 
we expect these costs to increase as we continue to expand our product development efforts and increase our clinical trial activities 
such costs in the future may also include payments to third party commercial manufacturers to support the advancement of our clinical pipeline 
clinical research fees in were million  a decrease of million or as compared to clinical research fees in were million  an increase of million or as compared to primarily as a result of an increase in the number of ongoing clinical trials particularly for mdx and mdx these costs include clinical investigator site fees  external trial monitoring costs and data accumulation costs 
we expect expenses related to clinical trials to increase in the future as we continue to develop our therapeutic product pipeline 
we expect product development costs to increase in the future as more of our products enter clinical trials 
in addition  we may be obligated to make milestone payments on certain of our products as they progress through the clinical trial process 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and intended use of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials  the duration of patient dosing and follow up in light of trial results  the number of clinical sites required for trials  and the number of patients that ultimately participate 
we continue to explore new collaborative arrangements that may affect future spending for research and development 
as part of our partnering strategy  a significant portion of the research and development expenses incurred in connection with products using our technology is expected to be borne by our partners 
we believe this allows us to participate in the research and development of substantially more potential product candidates than we could develop on our own if we bore the entire cost of development 
products using our technology are currently in various stages of development from preclinical to phase ii 
the successful development of these product candidates is dependent on many factors  including among other things  the efforts of our partners  unforeseen delays in  or expenditures relating to  preclinical development  clinical testing  manufacturing or regulatory approval  failure to receive market acceptance  the emergence of competitive products and the inability to produce or market our products due to third party proprietary rights 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include compensation  professional services  consulting  travel and facilities including depreciation and other expenses related to legal  business development  finance  information systems and investor relations 
general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by million in  or as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million  increased depreciation expense of million  increased insurance expense of million and increased legal fees of million 
general and administrative expenses in decreased by million  or as compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in legal fees of million primarily as a result of the completion of the negotiation and execution of our collaboration and license agreement with kirin in  and decreased consulting fees of million  partially offset by higher personnel costs of million 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future as our products are developed and we expand our business activities 
write off of facility costs write off of facility costs relates to a determination we made during the second quarter of to delay indefinitely the planned construction of a large scale manufacturing facility at our bloomsbury  new jersey  location and to pursue late stage clinical and commercial supply agreements with third party manufacturers with available capacity to meet our current internal production timetables 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a charge of million  representing the write off of design  engineering and other pre construction costs 
we believe that our existing facility in annandale  new jersey  is adequate for the production of materials for clinical trials of our products and for providing support we offer our partners in connection with our human antibody technology in the near term 
in september  we entered into a clinical supply agreement with lonza group ltd 
with respect to mdx  and discussions are ongoing with respect to terms of a commercial supply agreement 
acquisition of in process technology acquisition of in process technology for the year ended december   related to our acquisition of certain assets including certain preclinical product candidates and programs related to the research and development of therapeutic products for the treatment of autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases of corixa in may the total cost of the acquisition including transaction costs  discussed more fully under the section herein entitled liquidity and capital resources  was million 
based upon an independent third party valuation  million of the cost of the acquisition was charged to operations as acquisition of in process technology in during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with kyowa hakko kogyo co 
ltd  or the kyowa license 
under the terms of the kyowa license we received certain intellectual property rights relating to the development and commercialization of our ultra potent toxin technology 
the kyowa license was the result of a renegotiation of a pre existing license agreement with respect to ultra potent toxin technology between kyowa and corixa  which license agreement we acquired as part of the may asset acquisition 
upon the execution of the kyowa license  we paid kyowa a total of million and also made a final payment to corixa in the amount of million 
equity in net loss of affiliate equity in net loss of affiliate represents our share of genmab s net loss for the years ended december   and genmab is an affiliated company and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the recognition of our share of genmab s net losses reduces the carrying value  or basis  of our investment in genmab 
we expect that during the second half of the remaining basis of our investment in genmab will be reduced to zero and  accordingly  recognition of our share of genmab s net losses will be suspended 
equity in net loss of affiliate was million  million and million for the years ended december   and equity in net loss of affiliate in increased by million or as compared to included in equity in net loss of affiliate for is in an impairment loss on our investment in genmab of million resulting from an approximate decrease in the market value of genmab stock following genmab s september   press release in which it announced that its humax cd product  a fully human antibody that targets cd receptors on cells known as t cells was found not to be effective in combination with methotrexate in a phase ii study of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis 
we recorded the million impairment charge in the third quarter of as a result of the decrease in the market price of the genmab stock 
if we deem our investment in genmab to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge on this investment 
excluding this impairment charge  equity in net loss of affiliate in was million  an increase million  or over this increase reflects an increase in genmab s net loss as a result of its expanded research and development efforts 
equity in net loss of affiliate in decreased by million or as compared to excluding the impact of the impairment in  equity in net loss of affiliate decreased by million or as compared to this decrease was the result of a decrease in genmab s net loss for  primarily as a result of the recognition of million of milestone revenue recorded by genmab during interest and dividend income interest and dividend income consists primarily of interest earned from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest and dividend income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest and dividend income in decreased by million  or as compared to the decrease reflects lower interest income due to lower average cash balances as we funded our operations and capital expenditures from our cash reserves as well as lower interest rates 
interest and dividend income in decreased by million  or as compared to the decrease reflects lower returns on our investment portfolio which  on average  was also lower during the period 
we anticipate lower interest and dividend income in the future as we continue to fund our operations and capital expenditures from our cash reserves 
impairment loss on investments in partners in the course of our business we may make investments in companies both public and private as part of strategic collaborations 
we recorded impairment charges of  million and for the years ended december   and  respectively related to investments in certain of our partners other than genmab whose securities are publicly traded 
the impairment charge was the result of certain investments trading below their original cost basis for more than six months 
losses on these securities were determined to be temporary as of december   as each of these securities with an unrealized loss as of december  had traded at or above its cost basis within six months of december  if we deem these investments to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments 
in addition  we have investments in several partners whose securities are not publicly traded 
because these securities are not publicly traded  the value of these investments is inherently more difficult to estimate than investments in publicly traded companies 
we recorded impairment charges of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to investments in certain of our partners whose securities are not publicly traded 
the amount of the impairment charge was based on the estimated values as determined by our management and our original cost basis of these investments 
if we deem these investments to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments 
additional payments related to asset acquisitions additional payments related to asset acquisition of million and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively  represent additional purchase payments to northwest biotherapeutics  millennium pharmaceuticals and corixa in and to northwest biotherapeutics in pursuant to the terms of our agreements with these companies  under certain circumstances we were required to pay an amount equal to the difference between the proceeds received by these companies from the sale of any shares of our common stock delivered as payment of any installment of the purchase price of the assets and the total amount of the purchase price installment due under the agreements 
interest expense interest expense was primarily related to interest and amortization of issuance costs on our convertible senior notes issued in july  or the  notes and our convertible subordinated notes issued in june  or the notes 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense in increased by million  or over this increase reflects a full year of interest expense incurred on our notes 
the notes are due in july and interest is payable semi annually on january and july of each year 
interest expense in increased by million  or as compared to reflecting the addition of approximately five months of accrued interest on our notes 
the notes are due in august and interest is payable semi annually on february and august of each year 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million was the result of deferred foreign tax assets reversing during the provision for income taxes of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  relates primarily to the new jersey alternative minimum tax assessment which became effective in cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  was million 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
previously  we were not required to recognize amounts related to asset retirement obligations 
under sfas no 
 we now recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in an increase in net property  buildings and equipment of approximately million  recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of approximately million and a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operations  to make capital expenditures and strategic investments  and to pay debt service on our convertible notes 
since inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of our securities in public and private placements  sales of our products for research purposes  development and manufacturing services  technology transfer and license fees and milestone payments 
we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from these sources in the future 
in   and  we received net proceeds of million from sales of our equity and debt securities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we primarily invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities in order to preserve principal 
cash used in operating activities cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this reflects an increase of million in as compared to and an increase of million in as compared to the increases are primarily the result of the following an increase of million and million in and  respectively  in funding of research and development related to the development of our product pipeline 
a decrease of million and million in and  respectively  in interest and dividend income primarily due to lower interest rates as well as lower average cash balances 
an increase of million and million in and  respectively  in interest expense 
the increased interest expense in was the result of a full year of interest on our notes 
the increased interest expense in represents approximately five months of interest on our notes which were issued in july we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  as our products are developed 
we plan to spend significant amounts to progress our current products through the clinical trial and commercialization process as well as to develop additional product candidates on our own or with our partners 
as our products progress through the clinical trial process  we may be obligated to make significant milestone payments on certain of our products 
we also expect to incur future facility costs as a result of our continued capital expansion  renovations and replacements  but at a reduced rate 
to a lesser extent  we expect our general and administrative costs to increase as we expand our administrative and business development activities 
furthermore  we expect our investment income to decrease as we fund our future operations and capital expenditures from our cash reserves 
we anticipate that our operating expenditures may be partially offset by revenues from partners for license fees  milestone payments  and development and manufacturing services 
cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in and net cash provided by investing activities was million in cash was provided by and used in investing activities primarily as follows capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures in reflect an investment in building improvements and the purchase of machinery and equipment as well as furniture and fixtures related to the renovation of our bloomsbury  new jersey  facility  which we purchased in january capital spending in reflects an investment in building improvements related to the expansion of our milpitas  california  facility as well as leasehold improvements and the purchase of machinery  equipment and furniture and fixtures for our sunnyvale  california  facility  which we leased in july the capital expenditures in reflected an investment in laboratory automation as well as the addition of machinery and equipment 
net purchases of marketable securities of million in were primarily the result of the proceeds received from the sale of our notes in june see further discussion in the section entitled cash used in financing activities below 
net sales of marketable securities were million and million in and  respectively 
the net sales of marketable securities in were primarily to fund operations and capital expenditures 
the net sales of marketable securities in were the result of funding operations and capital expenditures offset by the net proceeds received million from the sale of our notes in july see further discussion below 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million representing the purchase of machinery and scientific equipment  additional investment in lab automation  and the planned expansion of our bloomsbury facility to accommodate the relocation of our clinical staff from our clinton  new jersey  facility whose lease expires in late cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million in net proceeds from the sale of our notes in june see further discussion below 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds received from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million in net proceeds received from the sale of our notes in july see further discussion below and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in june  we issued million of our notes 
the notes are initially convertible into shares of our common stock at the rate of shares per each  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
interest is payable on january and july of each year 
we made our first interest payment on the notes on january the notes mature on july   and are redeemable at our option on or after july   or earlier if the price of our common stock exceeds specified levels 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes if we undergo a change in control as defined in the indenture 
we received net proceeds from the issuance of the notes of approximately million

these nol carryforwards will expire in the years as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  if not utilized 
during we determined that an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  occurred during the effect of this ownership change was the imposition of a million annual limitation on the use of nol carryforwards attributable to periods before the change

our convertible notes may be converted to common stock prior to the maturity date and  therefore  may not require the use of our capital resources 
in january  we and certain holders of our notes completed in a limited number of transactions  an exchange and cancellation of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  for the issuance of million in aggregate principal of a new series of convertible senior notes due august  as a result of this exchange and cancellation  our total convertible debt was reduced by million 
financial uncertainties related to potential future milestone payments effective september   we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with kirin brewery co  ltd  which provides for us to exchange with kirin certain cross licenses for each other s technology for the development and commercialization of human antibody products 
pursuant to a letter of intent that was superceded by the collaboration and license agreement  we and kirin developed the km mouse  a unique crossbred mouse which combines the traits of our humab mouse with kirin s tc mouse 
under the collaboration and license agreement  we are exchanging cross licenses with kirin with respect to the km mouse and other antibody generating mice 
in addition  certain of the cross licenses granted under the collaboration and license agreement are subject to license  milestone and royalty payments by one party to the other 
through december   we have not made any milestone payments to kirin 
based on a total of three products we are developing which use or  we believe may use  kirin technology that i are currently in clinical trials  or ii we anticipate may enter clinical trials through the end of  we may be required to make milestone payments to kirin aggregating up to approximately million with respect to such products  or a maximum of approximately million per product 
our future milestone payment obligations to kirin may or may not be triggered  and may vary in size  depending on a number of variables  almost all of which are currently unknown  including the following whether or not a decision is made to request a license from kirin  the type of license requested research or commercial  the success and timing of development efforts and clinical trials of product candidates covered by any such licenses  the type of product developed  payment obligations differ depending on whether a product is an ex vivo therapeutic  in vivo therapeutic  research reagent or diagnostic  and other financial provisions of the kirin agreement that provide for variations in fee levels and netting of certain payments over specified periods of time that may impact the total amount potentially payable to kirin for any particular license fee or milestone payment 
we have also entered into a number of other agreements that contain licenses of third party technology which may be used together with our own platform technologies for the generation  development and or manufacture of our antibody products 
in addition  we have entered into other third party agreements that contain licenses associated with antibody products that target specific antigens 
many of these agreements contain milestones payments that are due with respect to products using targeting the licensed technology antigen only if and when certain specified pre commercialization events occur 
not all of our products currently under development trigger such milestone payments 
through december   we have made no milestone payments under these agreements 
in addition  under the agreements we currently have in place other than with kirin  based on a total of five products we are developing for which milestones are potentially due and that i are now in clinical trials  or ii which we anticipate may enter clinical trials before the end of  we may be obligated to make future milestone payments aggregating up to approximately million with respect to such products 
in general  potential milestone payments for our antibody products may or may not be triggered under these licenses  and may vary in size  depending on a number of variables  almost all of which are currently uncertain 
typically  the events that trigger these payments per product include submission of ind s or foreign equivalents  commencement of phase i  phase ii and or phase iii clinical trials or foreign equivalents  submission of bla s or foreign equivalents  and receipt of marketing approval s to sell products in a particular country or region 
in addition  the licenses above may trigger royalty payments in connection with the commercialization of certain of our products 
to date  we have not made any royalty payments on sales of our products and believe we are at least a few years away from selling any products that would require us to make any such royalty payments 
whether we will be obligated to make milestone or royalty payments in the future is subject to the success of our product development efforts and  accordingly  is inherently uncertain 
future liquidity resources our current sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest and dividends earned on such cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  contract and licensing revenue and sales of our products for research 
we believe that such sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our operating  debt service  and capital requirements for at least the next months  however  this month period assumes the use of a portion of the million and or the million required to meet our repayment obligations with respect to our convertible notes due on july   and august   respectively 
to the extent our convertible notes are converted into shares of our common stock on or before their respective maturity dates  we will have use of that portion of the notes to fund our on going operations 
in any event  we may require additional financing within this time frame and may raise funds through public or private financings  line of credit arrangements  collaborative relationships and or other methods 
the use of cash on hand or other financial alternatives will depend on several factors including  but not limited to  the future success of our products in clinical development  the prevailing interest rate environment  and access to the capital markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise such additional funds 
we may be unable to raise sufficient funds to complete development of any of our product candidates or to continue operations 
as a result  we may face delay  reduction or elimination of research and development programs or preclinical or clinical trials  in which case our business  financial condition or results of operations may be materially harmed 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb the primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise the primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either i the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the effective dates and impact of fin and fin r are as follows i special purpose entities spes created prior to february  we must apply either the provisions of fin or early adopt the provisions of fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period after december  ii non spes created prior to february  we are required to adopt fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  iii all entities  regardless of whether a spe  that were created subsequent to january  the provisions of fin were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after january  we are required to adopt fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the adoption of the provisions applicable to spes and all other variable interests obtained after january  had no impact on our financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin r applicable to non spes created prior to february  but do not expect a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on accounting for arrangements involving the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement with multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the provisions of eitf are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  including redeemable convertible preferred stock 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the interim period commencing july  the fasb has indefinitely deferred implementation of certain provisions of sfas the adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the us government  as well as fixed income investments and us bond funds both of which can be readily purchased or sold using established markets 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
we do not believe we have any material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates  however  we may experience reinvestment risk as fixed income securities mature and are reinvested in securities bearing lower interest rates 
we may be exposed to exchange conversion differences in translating the foreign results of our investment in genmab to us dollars 
depending upon the relative strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  the conversion difference could be significant
