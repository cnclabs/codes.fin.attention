critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that interpharm make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  interpharm evaluates judgments and estimates made  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  income taxes and contingencies including litigation 
interpharm bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing its financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue from the sale of interpharm products are recognized upon shipment of the product 
upon a review of specific accounts and historical experience we record  when necessary  a provision for allowances  chargebacks  returns and other sales credits based 
these provisions have been recorded as a reduction of sales in the consolidated statements of income 
we purchase raw materials from two suppliers  which are manufactured into finished goods and sold back to such suppliers as well as to other customers 
we can  and do  purchase raw materials from other suppliers 
we also i have the general inventory risk of loss associated with the raw materials purchased  ii negotiate the selling price for the finished product  iii significantly change the raw material into a finished product based upon our specifications  and iv have the option to obtain the raw materials from alternate sources 
these factors among others  qualify us as the principal under the indicators set forth in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal vs 
net as an agent 
if the terms and substance of the arrangement change  such that we no longer qualify to report these transactions on a gross reporting basis  our net income and cash flows would not be affected 
however  our sales and cost of sales would both be reduced by a similar amount 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon customer specific analysis and assessment of past due balances 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is an increase in past due balances or for customer specific circumstances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at june  and  at june  inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials and manufacturing 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when factors such as expiration dates and spoilage indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are disposed of and completely written off in the period incurred 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
the net deferred tax asset is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our net deferred tax asset at june  was  and  at june  recent accounting pronouncements in january  and revised in december  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
r fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
prior to the issuance of this interpretation  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin requires a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
for these purposes  variable interests held by related parties should be combined with the reporting entity 
fin is effective for our company 
the adoption of fin had no impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
issue and uncertainties risk of product liability claims the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products subject us to the risk of product liability claims 
we believe that we maintain an adequate amount of product liability insurance  but no assurance can be given that such insurance will cover all existing and future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates

quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risks our principal financial instrument currently is a million credit facility 
at june   million mortgage note payable and borrowings of  under the line of credit was outstanding 
the  borrowings were repaid subsequent to june  any obligations created under this credit facility incur interest calculated at our option at i libor plus for periods ranging in length from to months  or ii at the bank s then fixed prime rate

we are required to comply with certain financial covenants 
the bank will review the new credit facility annually  the next review is scheduled to occur no later than november  the credit lines are terminable by the bank at any time as to undrawn amounts 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  fluctuations in commodity prices or other market risks  nor do we invest in speculative financial instruments 
due to the nature of our borrowings as described above and our relatively small amount of short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material risk exposure which could occur as a result of possible changes in market interest rates
