item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ari was organized in in august  ari acquired art and nrlp

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of ari s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgements 
ari s critical accounting policies relate to the evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and the evaluation of the collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  management performs a recoverability analysis based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the property is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if management decides to sell rental properties or land held for development  management evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized within income from continuing operations 
ari s estimates of cash flow and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
ari s estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and ari s assessments of them change 
in the second quarter of  ari recognized asset impairments of million 
in the fourth quarter of  ari recognized asset impairments of million 
ari s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor and ari s assessment of its ability to meet its lease or interest obligations 
ari s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions 
ari s management periodically discusses criteria for estimates and disclosures of its estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities  as defined fin is applicable to financial statements to be issued by ari after  however  disclosures are required currently if ari expects to consolidate any variable interest entities 
ari does not currently believe that any entities will be consolidated as a result of fin 
table of contents in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires the issuer to classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of the standard as a liability if such financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to require ari to reclass any financial instruments currently on its balance sheet 
obligations and commitments ari has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to the payment of mortgages 
the following table aggregates ari s expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  dollars in thousands 
contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total ari s long term debt may contain financial covenants that  if certain thresholds are not met  could allow the lender to accelerate principal payments or cause the note to become due immediately 
liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  compared with million at december  although ari anticipates that during it will generate excess cash from operations  as discussed below  such excess cash will not be sufficient to discharge all of ari s debt obligations as they mature 
ari will  therefore  again rely on externally generated funds  including aggressive land sales  selected sales of income producing properties  borrowings against its investments in various real estate entities  refinancing of properties and  to the extent necessary  borrowings to meet its debt service obligations  pay taxes  interest and other non property related expenses 
historically  management has been successful at extending current maturity obligations

net cash used in operating 
table of contents activities was million 
interest receivable increased by million due to additional notes receivable for seller financing  other assets decreased by million primarily due to reduced escrow deposits  interest payable increased by million primarily due to unpaid interest on disputed notes payable  decrease in minority interest primarily due to allocation of losses to minority owners  and other liabilities increased by million primarily due to increased deferred gains from property sales 
net cash provided by investing activities of million was primarily due to proceeds from sale of real estate of million  proceeds from the sale of notes receivable of million  and collection of notes receivable of million 
these inflows were offset by real estate improvements of million  investments in real estate entities of million  acquisition of real estate of million  and earnest money deposits of million 
net cash used in financing activities of million was primarily comprised of proceeds from the funding or refinancing of notes payable of million  net margin borrowings of million and net advances from affiliates of million  offset by payouts of million to pay down existing notes payable  million for financing costs  and million in dividends on preferred stock

ari also sold apartments  four office buildings  four industrial warehouses  two hotels  and six shopping centers for a total of million 
ari received net cash of million  after the payoff or assumption by the purchaser of mortgage debt totaling million and after providing purchase money financing of million 
ari expects that funds from existing cash resources  aggressive sales of land and selected income producing property sales  refinancing of real estate  and borrowings against its real estate will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements associated with ari s current and anticipated level of operations  maturing debt obligations and existing commitments 
to the extent that ari s liquidity permits or financing sources are available  ari will make investments in real estate  primarily in improved and unimproved land  will continue making investments in real estate entities and marketable equity securities  and will develop and construct income producing properties 
ari expects that it will be necessary for it to sell million  million and million of its land holdings during each of the next three years to satisfy the debt on the land as it matures 
if ari is unable to sell at least the minimum amount of land to satisfy the land debt obligations as they mature  ari  intends to extend such debt or sell other of its assets  specifically income producing properties  to pay the debt

table of contents equity investments 
during the fourth quarter of  ari began purchasing shares of iori and tci  both of which had the same advisor as ari until june  it is anticipated that additional equity securities of iori and tci may be acquired in the future through open market and negotiated transactions to the extent ari s liquidity permits 
see item business for discussion of the tender offer for shares of tci and iori common stock by ari and the current ownership of tci and iori by ari 
equity securities of iori and tci held by ari may be deemed to be restricted securities under rule of the securities act of securities act 
accordingly  ari may be unable to sell such equity securities other than in a registered public offering or pursuant to an exemption under the securities act for a one year period after they are acquired 
such restrictions may reduce ari s ability to realize the full fair market value of such investments if ari attempted to dispose of such securities in a short period of time 
ari s cash flow from these investments is dependent on the ability of iori to make distributions 
in december  the board of iori suspended the payment of quarterly dividends 
ari received no distributions from iori in  and ari anticipates receiving no distributions from iori in in  ari paid dividends to its preferred stockholders totaling million 
management reviews the carrying values of ari s properties and mortgage notes receivable at least annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
impairment is considered to exist if  in the case of a property  the future cash flow from the property undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment is considered to exist if it is probable that all amounts due under the terms of the note will not be collected 
if impairment is found to exist  a provision for loss is recorded by a charge against earnings to the extent that the investment in the note exceeds management s estimate of the fair value of the collateral securing such note 
the mortgage note receivable review includes an evaluation of the collateral property securing each note 
the property review generally includes selective property inspections  a review of the property s current rents compared to market rents  a review of the property s expenses  a review of maintenance requirements  a review of the property s cash flow  discussions with the manager of the property  and a review of properties in the surrounding area
