kc the lawsuits filed in los angeles county superior court are based on the allegations that scw and the other defendants have provided and continue to provide plaintiffs with contaminated water from its wells  several of which are located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a federal superfund site  that the maintenance of this contaminated well water has resulted in contamination of the soil  subsurface soil and surrounding air with solvents and other substances  and that plaintiffs have been injured and their property damaged as a result

as the lawsuits filed in sacramento county superior court are based on the allegations that scw and other defendants have delivered water to plaintiffs that are contaminated with a number of chemicals  including trichloroethylene  perchloroethylene  carbon tetrachloride  perchlorate  freon  hexavalent chromium and other unnamed chemicals and that plaintiffs have been injured and their property damaged as a result 
on september   the court of appeals in san francisco held that the cpuc had preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities with respect to water quality matters and ordered dismissal of a series of these lawsuits 
on october   one group of plaintiffs appealed this decision to the california supreme court 
on february   the california supreme court concluded that i the cpuc had preemptive jurisdiction over claims seeking injunctive relief and claims based on the theory that a public utility regulated by the cpuc provided unsafe drinking water even though it had complied with federal and state drinking water standards  but ii the cpuc did not have preemptive jurisdiction over damage claims based on allegations of violations of federal and state drinking water standards by public utilities regulated by the cpuc 
as a result  damage claims based on allegations of violations of federal and state drinking water standards may proceed while the other claims must be dismissed 
in light of the breadth of plaintiff s claims  the lack of factual information regarding plaintiffs claims and injuries  if any  the impact of the california supreme court decision on plaintiffs claims and the fact that investigation is presently underway  scw is unable at this time to determine what  if any  potential liability it may have with respect to these claims 
based upon the information currently available to it  registrant believes that these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against these claims 
scw is subject to self insured retention provisions in its applicable insurance policies and has either expensed the self insured amounts or has reserved against payment of these amounts as appropriate 
scw s various insurance carriers have  to date  provided reimbursement for costs incurred above the self insured amounts for defense against these lawsuits  subject to a reservation of rights 

table of contents order instituting investigation oii in march  the cpuc issued an oii to regulated water utilities in the state of california  including scw 
the purpose of the oii was to determine whether existing standards and policies regarding drinking water quality adequately protect the public health and whether those standards and policies were being uniformly complied with by those water utilities 
on november   a final decision from the cpuc concluded that the cpuc has the jurisdiction to regulate the service of water utilities with respect to the health and safety of that service  that the california department of health services requirements governing drinking water quality adequately protect the public health and safety  and that  based on an extensive review of years of water quality records  regulated water utilities  including scw  have satisfactorily complied with past and present drinking water quality requirements  except for one small unrelated water utility in northern california 
the cpuc had previously authorized establishment of memorandum accounts to capture expenses related to the oii 
under the memorandum account procedure  scw may recover litigation costs from ratepayers to the extent authorized by the cpuc 
as of december   scw had incurred a net cost of  related to the oii 
in a decision issued by the cpuc on march  on scw s filing for its region iii and general office functions  scw is allowed to recover the cost through a special condition surcharge over a twelve month period 
other water quality litigation on october   scw filed a lawsuit against the state of california and its state water resources control board  central valley regional water quality control board  and department of toxic substances control collectively  the state alleging that the state had substantially participated in a project to inject chemical pollution into portions of the sacramento county groundwater basin and that pollution is progressively destroying the groundwater supply in scw s rancho cordova water system 
scw and the state have entered into a comprehensive  settlement for all of scw s claims against the state  contingent upon the court s approval of the good faith of the settlement  which scw received in full during the third quarter of in a separate case  also filed on october   scw sued aerojet general corporation aerojet for causing the contamination of eastern portions of the sacramento county groundwater basin 
a cross complaint filed by aerojet against scw for negligence and constituting a public nuisance was voluntarily dismissed by aerojet in october on october  registrant entered into a confidential memorandum of understanding mou with the aerojet general subsidiary of gencorp  inc for the settlement of legal actions brought by scw 
the mou sets forth the present financial terms and the structure of a settlement to cover  over time  capital and litigation related costs incurred by scw resulting from the contamination 
the mou and the settlement embodied therein was found to be binding by the sacramento superior court on january  further documentation incorporating the terms of the mou is presently underway 
however  documentation is not complete and management is presently unable to predict when a comprehensive set of settlement documents will be completed 
based on the financial terms in the mou  scw established a receivable from aerojet in an amount of million for capital project and purchased water reimbursements at the end of  of which million has been received in early and is recorded in current other accounts receivable on the balance sheets 
the remainder of the costs is subject to further settlement documentation reimbursements received from aerojet have been applied directly to reduce scw s costs of utility plant and purchased water 
prior to the mou  aerojet had reimbursed scw million in capital costs and  for additional water supply 
in an action related to the draft settlement agreement  registrant and aerojet have signed three separate agreements requiring aerojet to pay for certain infrastructure and upgrades to registrant s coloma treatment plant as a contingency plan should additional wells be impacted prior to the high summer demand period of the value of the three agreements approximates million in capital improvements 
in addition  scw is in negotiations with the county of sacramento regarding a replacement of water supply 

table of contents the cpuc has previously authorized memorandum accounts to allow for recovery  from customers  of costs incurred by scw in prosecuting the suits filed against the state and aerojet  less any recovery from the defendants or others 
as of december   approximately million in legal and consulting related costs has been recorded as deferred charges and included as regulatory assets on the balance sheets 
the cpuc has authorized scw to increase rates  effective april   for recovery over a six year period of approximately million in expenses that were incurred on or before august   in the aerojet matter 
as part of an abbreviated application for scw s region i  scw requested a long term amortization of the balance of costs included in the aerojet litigation memorandum account  net of any reimbursement amount 
the draft agreement also addresses the possible recovery of scw s deferred charges through revenues in new development areas 
management believes these costs are recoverable either through rates or the settlement agreement with aerojet

the compound mtbe has been detected in a well serving scw s los osos water system 
for some time scw has been working with the regional water quality control board as well as the owner of a service station 
although the owner of the service station has attempted remediation with funds provided through the california underground storage tank fund custf  it appears there will be insufficient funds from the custf to complete remediation sufficient to return the well to service 
in order to prevent the running of the statute of limitations  on august  scw filed suit in the superior court of the state of california for the county of san luis obispo against the operators and owners of the service station facility  and chevron usa products  inc  the supplier 
a settlement with chevron has been reached and a filing has been made for dismissal by the court 
scw has dismissed all other parties 
the impacted well may need to be removed permanently from service and the settlement with chevron is expected to afford scw sufficient funds to commence site development and construction of a replacement well 
perchlorate and or volatile organic compounds voc have been detected in five wells servicing scw s san gabriel system 
scw filed suit  along with two other affected water purveyors and the san gabriel basin water quality authority wqa  in the federal court against some of those responsible for the contamination 
some of the other potential defendants settled with scw  other water purveyors and the wqa on voc related issues prior to the filing of the lawsuit 
in response to the filing of the federal lawsuit  the potentially responsible party prp defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit or strike certain portions of the suit 
the judge issued a ruling on april  granting in part and denying in part the defendant s motions 
a key ruling of the court was that the water purveyors  including the registrant  by virtue of their ownership of wells contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
registrant has  pursuant to permission of the court  amended its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party under cercla 
registrant is presently unable to predict the outcome of this ruling on its ability to fully recover from the prps the future costs associated with the treatment of these wells 
on august   the us environmental protection agency issued unilateral administrative orders uao against parties deemed responsible for polluting the groundwater in that portion of the san gabriel valley from which scw s two impacted wells draw water 
scw was not named as a party to the uao 
the uao requires that these parties remediate the contamination 
as a result of the issuance of the uao  these parties have begun settlement discussions regarding the federal lawsuits with scw  the other two affected water purveyors and wqa 
registrant is presently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these settlement discussions 
mco properties  inc  a real estate developer mco  has filed a complaint against awr and ccwc in the superior court of maricopa county cv on june  alleging breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  interference with prospective economic advantage  negligence and negligent misrepresentation and seeking a declaratory judgment 
the complaint arises out of allegations by mco that awr has failed to comply with the terms of the stock purchase agreement between mco and awr pursuant to which awr acquired ccwc from mco and has thereby interfered with mco s ability to develop its real property in the town of fountain hills 
a revised complaint was filed on december  further alleging that ccwc has not maintained its designation of assured supply as required in the stock purchase agreement 
similar allegations have been filed by mco against ccwc with the arizona corporation commission docket no 
w a 
there have been settlement discussions seeking to resolve these issues 
in addition  ccwc has undertaken actions that it believes will enable it to continue to maintain its assured water supply designation in a manner that will enable ccwc to provide water service to new real estate developments in the town of fountain hills  including properties owned by mco 
awr and arizona department of water resources adwr have also agreed that the town of fountain hills may approve and record final parcel plats for subdivisions for which ccwc has entered into written commitments to provide water service  conditional on i adwr sending a notification to the town that adwr has approved a 
table of contents modification to ccwc s designation or otherwise has determined that ccwc has enough water for current and committed demands including the subdivision  and ii mco not submitting a request to the state real estate commissioner for a public report for the subdivision in advance of adwr s issuance of the notification to the town

electric service litigation scw has been  in conjunction with the southern california edison edison unit of edison international  planning to upgrade transmission facilities to kv the kv project in order to meet increased energy and demand requirements for scw s bear valley electric service area 
on december   scw filed a lawsuit against edison for declaratory relief and seeking damages for breach of contract as a result of delays in the kv project  violations of good faith and fair dealing  negligent misrepresentation  intentional misrepresentation and unjust enrichment 
subsequently edison filed a cross complaint against scw for breach of contract  anticipatory breach  and quantum meruit 
scw has also sought declaratory relief from edison s claims 
to date  scw has spent approximately million in this matter  all of which has been expensed 
a settlement has been reached between scw and edison  in which i scw is to pay edison million as the cost of abandoning and terminating the kv project  ii edison shall make a filing with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to include the cost in a ferc rate schedule under the transmission service agreement between scw and edison  and iii edison is to sell the goldhill substation and associated transmission line to scw at its book value 
management believes that the ferc s approval on edison s filing is probable and this cost is within the meaning of the cpuc s code of abandonment fee which is recoverable through the supply cost balancing account 
as a result  the million obligation to edison arising from the settlement was recorded as a liability and a regulatory asset in the fourth quarter of a final settlement agreement was reached on march  other litigation registrant is also subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business 
other than as disclosed above  no other legal proceedings are pending  which are believed to be material

operating revenues for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased slightly by to million compared to million for the year ended december  higher water revenues reflect two rate increases for scw s region ii that were effective on january  and february   respectively 
these rate increases are expected to generate additional water revenues of approximately million annually 
the rate increases were offset by a decrease of in water consumption resulting from wetter and cooler temperatures in most of scw s service areas 
differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparative periods 

table of contents for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects rate increases in july authorized by the cpuc to cover purchased power costs under various power supply agreements which resulted in increased revenues of approximately million  and a slight increase in kilowatt hour consumption 
other operating revenues consist of nonregulated water related services and operations on a contract basis ranging from services  such as billing and meter reading  to full operation of water utility related systems  all performed by awr s subsidiary  american states utility services  inc asus 
for the year ended december   other operating revenues increased by to million compared to  for the year ended december  due to the addition of a new billing contract with the city of chino hills which increased revenues by approximately  asus is pursuing growth and new business development for awr  most specifically in the area of privatization of water and wastewater systems at military bases 
as such  asus has carefully reviewed growth opportunities and exercised prudence in the pursuit of increased revenues and earnings from contract operations that are congruent with awr s core competencies 
during  asus was an active participant in the privatization of military bases  currently with active bids for such opportunities 
to date  asus has received preliminary notification that it will be awarded a year contract to own and operate the water and wastewater systems at ft 
bliss  located near el paso  texas 
asus plans to continue to bid on and negotiate for other military bases during also in  asus worked to develop an operating contract for the water and wastewater services in the rapidly developing area presently served by a mutual water company in northern california 
asus anticipates signing definitive agreements in and expect development to take place in this area beginning in registrant relies upon rate increases for water and electric services approved by regulatory bodies in california and arizona in order to recover operating expenses and provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant 
without such adequate rate relief granted in a timely manner  revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
applications for rate increases that are currently pending are discussed under regulation pending rate changes in part ii  item in management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
operating expenses for the year ended december   purchased water costs decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to i approximately million incurred in connection with the purchasing and trucking of water in scw s wrightwood customer service area due to a sudden and unexplained drop in groundwater level in the area during the early part of the third quarter of the water hauling ended in january  ii a  reimbursement from aerojet on water purchased from the sacramento municipal utility district smud pursuant to the memo of understanding entered into in october  iii approximately  of refunds from metropolitan water district member agencies relating to the water year  and iv overall lower consumption 
the decrease is offset by i an increase in the costs of water rights pumped in scw s region ii and ii additional purchased water in the current year necessary to replace pumped water supply lost due to wells being temporarily removed from service as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems  particularly in scw s foothill district 
registrant has had to take a number of wells out of service from time to time due to various causes  including contamination by third parties 
changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s own wells can increase actual supply related costs relative to the supply related costs approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
registrant has the opportunity to change the supply related costs recovered through rates by application to the appropriate regulatory body 
registrant believes that its applications for recovery of supply related costs accurately reflect the water supply situation as it is known at the time 
however  it is impossible to adequately protect earnings from adverse changes in supply costs related to unforeseen contamination 
for the year ended december   of our supply mix was purchased water as compared to purchased water for the year ended december  for the year ended december   cost of power purchased for pumping decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to lower consumption and additional wells down for maintenance and water quality issues 
the effect of wells being offline was partially offset by increased power rates and resulted in an increase in purchased water as discussed above 

table of contents for the year ended december   cost of power purchased for resale to customers in scw s bear valley electric division decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is due to the upfront payments received from pwcc which result in lower power costs at a price of per megawatt hour mwh effective november under scw s power supply agreements with pinnacle west capital corporation pwcc as compared to per mwh for energy purchased from mirant americas energy marketing  llp mirant marketing under then existing contracts in the same period of effective november  scw entered into a series of purchase power contracts with pwcc 
under the agreements  scw will exchange mws of electric energy with pwcc that results in an upfront payment of per mwh for mws over the period beginning november  through december  this upfront payment is being recorded as a reduction of purchased power costs which are included in the supply cost balancing account 
unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represents gains and losses recorded for scw s purchased power agreements  with pwcc  which qualify as derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the  pre tax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to an increase in the current forward market prices since december  there is no cash flow impact from the unrealized gains and losses on the purchased power contracts 
unrealized gains and losses at bear valley electric will continue to impact earnings during the life of the contract with pwcc 
for the year ended december   groundwater production assessments decreased slightly by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to a decrease in pumped water  offset by increases in assessment rates levied against groundwater production effective july a positive entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects recovery of previously under collected supply costs 
conversely  a negative entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects an under collection of previously incurred supply costs 
an increase of million during the year ended december  in the provision for supply cost balancing accounts as compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects i new rates authorized in july to recover electric power costs which resulted in approximately million of revenues to recover electric power costs  ii the approval on june  of the pre november  water supply balancing accounts totaling million  which scw will be amortizing over months  and iii the recording of a probable refund of million to customers representing the net proceeds received from the prp s with respect to the charnock basin contamination  pursuant to the proposed decision issued by the cpuc in december for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i higher labor  chemicals and water treatment costs which increased by almost  ii approximately  of refunds for a sewer service overpayment in june for which there was no counterpart in  and iii reimbursements totaling  received during the year ended december  from settling parties for expenses incurred in the san gabriel basin to meet water quality standards compared to recovery of expenses of  in for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i approximately million increase in outside legal and consulting services incurred in connection with new business development  most specifically in the area of privatization of water and wastewater systems at military bases  and in defense of the edison lawsuit for bear valley electric  ii approximately  increase in pensions and benefits due to actuarial assumption changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and increases in various benefit costs  and iii the reversal of the remaining reserve of million in for potential non recovery of electric power costs incurred to serve customers at scw s bear valley electric customer service area 
the reserve was established in to offset future impacts to earnings for the difference between authorized rates and scw s actual electric power costs 
there is no similar reversal in the increases are partially offset by the reversal of certain reserves based on a cpuc decision issued on march  on this date  the cpuc approved a special condition surcharge in rates to amortize the water quality order instituting investigation oii memorandum account balance which scw had previously reserved  and scw is authorized to establish a memorandum account to accumulate costs to comply with certain contamination remediation requirements 
based on the decision  scw reversed its  oii reserve and million in water quality related reserves into income during the fourth quarter of registrant believes that prudent administrative expenses incurred in the operation and management of its regulated subsidiaries will be recovered through water and electric rates 

table of contents registrant plans through its non regulated subsidiary  american state utility services  inc  to continue with the analysis and preparation of bids for submission to the department of defense dod pursuant to dod s initiative to privatize the water and wastewater assets and operations of military bases 
the analysis and preparation of these bids is an extensive process and  as such  registrant expects to incur approximately million in for such efforts due to the volume of requests for proposals available from the dod 
registrant expects that it will be awarded its first privatization of a military base during and will enter into negotiations for several other bases as well 
for the year ended december   depreciation expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of recording approximately million in utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies will be recovered through water and electric rates 
for the year ended december   maintenance expense increased slightly by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due principally to increased maintenance on scw s water supply sources and maintenance of water mains 
for the year ended december   taxes on income decreased by to million compared to million for year ended december  due primarily to lower pre tax operating income and the effects of flow through true up adjustments comparing estimated accrual with actual tax return amounts 
sfas no 
requires that rate regulated enterprises record deferred income taxes for temporary differences accorded flow through treatment at the direction of a regulatory commission 
such items including flow through adjustments thereof have a direct impact on registrant s effective rate 
for the year ended december   other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes based on increased labor costs 
other income loss for the year ended december   other income decreased to million loss compared to  income for the year ended december  the net decrease reflects a cpuc decision on march  that ordered scw to refund percent of the total amount of lease revenues received form the city of folsom since  plus interest  to customers 
pursuant to the order  for the year ended december  scw recorded a million charge against non operating income less million of taxes 
management intends to appeal the decision and will vigorously defend its position 
other income loss also decreased due to the sale of a parcel of non operating property in region ii of scw in the first quarter of for which there was a gain of approximately  interest charges for the year ended december   interest expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to higher short term borrowings incurred to finance capital expenditures 
registrant anticipates that interest costs will increase in future periods due to the need for additional external capital to fund its construction program and to the likelihood that interest rates will increase at some future point 
registrant believes that costs associated with capital used to fund construction at its regulated subsidiaries will continue to be recovered in water and electric rates charged to customer 

table of contents consolidated results of operations years ended december  and year year ended ended change change operating revenues water electric other total operating revenues operating expenses water purchased power purchased for resale power purchased for pumping unrealized loss on purchased power contracts groundwater production assessment supply cost balancing accounts other operating expenses administrative and general expenses depreciation and amortization maintenance taxes on income other taxes total operating expenses operating income other income loss net interest charges net income net income for the year ended december  decreased to million  equivalent to per common share on a basic and fully diluted basis  respectively  compared to million or per share for the year ended december  the decreases in the recorded results primarily reflect the lack of timely approval of revenue increases by the cpuc  and the impact of the removal of balancing account treatment for supply costs enacted by the cpuc in november partially offsetting these items was the reversal in of a reserve established in for potentially unrecoverable purchased power costs and various other reasons as discussed below 
operating revenues water operating revenues increased by in to million from the million reported in due to an increase of in consumption due to drier weather conditions as compared to the prior year 
there were no significant water rate increases effective during differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas will impact sales of water to customers and may cause fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparative periods 

table of contents electric revenues increased by to million in as compared to million in the increases reflected i a rate increase of effective may  and an additional increase effective august  authorized by the cpuc to recover previously under collected energy costs  ii rate increases in july authorized by the cpuc to cover purchased power costs under various power supply agreements  and iii an increase of in kilowatt hour consumption  primarily due to heavier use of snow making machines at ski resorts in the area in the fourth quarter of registrant relies upon rate increases for water and electric services approved by regulatory bodies in california and arizona in order to recover operating expenses and provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant 
without such adequate rate relief granted in a timely manner  revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
operating expenses purchased water costs in increased by to million as compared to million in  reflecting an increase in purchased water volume resulting from i higher water consumption  ii additional purchased water necessary in to replace pumped water supply lost due to wells being removed from service as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems  particularly in scw s orange county and san dimas customer service areas  iii refunds received from scw s wholesale water suppliers during of approximately  for which there was no counterpart in  and iv costs of approximately million  incurred most significantly in connection with the trucking of water  in scw s wrightwood customer service area due to a sudden and unexplained drop in groundwater level in the area during the early part of the third quarter of for the years ended december  and  of our supply mix was purchased water 
registrant has had to take a number of wells out of service from time to time due to various causes  including contamination by third parties 
changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s own wells can increase actual supply related costs relative to the supply related costs approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
registrant has the opportunity to change the supply related costs recovered through rates by application to the appropriate regulatory body 
registrant believes that its applications for recovery of supply related costs accurately reflect the water supply situation as it is known at the time 
however  it is impossible to adequately protect earnings from adverse changes in supply costs related to unforeseen contamination 
costs of power purchased for pumping increased by to million in as compared to million recorded in  due to the rate increases implemented in by scw s energy suppliers  in particular southern california edison company and pacific gas and electric company 
in  the cpuc approved a portion of scw s advice letters to increase revenues by approximately million annually to recover the costs of purchased power for certain of its water ratemaking districts 
a gain of  recorded in the fourth quarter of for the sale of groundwater in the chino basin also impacted the comparison 
there was no such sale in costs of power purchased for resale to customers in scw s bear valley electric division in decreased by to million from the million recorded in due primarily to lower power costs in the first quarter of under scw s power supply agreements to cover peak winter demand as compared to the costs for energy purchased on the spot market in the same period of offsetting the decrease was a one time sale of energy on the spot market that generated a  gain in april the gain is the subject of a complaint filed at the federal energy regulatory commission by mirant marketing where mirant marketing  the purchaser of the energy  is seeking to be refunded all or a portion of the gain 
ferc is scheduled to take up the issue at their public meeting by the end of march the sale of excess energy on the spot market in resulted from a one month overlap of energy purchase agreements 
unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represents gains and losses recorded for scw s power purchase agreements  with pwcc  which qualify as derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the million pre tax unrealized loss on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to actual contract prices being higher than the current forward market prices as of december  there is no cash flow impact from the unrealized gains and losses on the purchased power contracts 
unrealized gains and losses at bear valley electric will continue to impact earnings during the life of the contract with pwcc 

table of contents groundwater production assessments increased by to million in from million in the increase reflects i an increase in well production and higher assessments levied against production for the water year as compared with the previous year in scw s metropolitan customer service area  and ii increased pumped costs in scw s orange county customer service area due to an in lieu program implemented by the metropolitan water district of southern california mwd to help preserve groundwater levels in the area  which allows scw to purchase treated water from mwd essentially at scw s groundwater pumping costs 
the increases were partially offset by revenues from leases of unused water rights to third parties in scw s barstow customer service area in a positive entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects recovery of previously under collected supply costs 
conversely  a negative entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects an under collection of previously incurred supply costs 
the negative entries for and primarily reflect untimely recovery of electric power costs discussed previously 
an increase of million during the year ended december  in the provision for supply cost balancing accounts as compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects the new rates authorized in july to recover electric power costs 
at december   scw had a combined net under collected position of million in both its water and electric balancing accounts  primarily due to the increases in energy costs 
other operating expenses decreased slightly in to million as compared with million in due primarily to i a refund for a sewer service overpayment  ii reimbursement received during from the settling parties for expenses incurred in the san gabriel basin to meet water quality standards for which there was no counterpart in  and iii a decrease in the accrual for bad debt  net of increased water treatment costs  chemical costs and higher labor costs 
administrative and general expenses decreased by in to million from million recorded in reflecting reversal of the remaining reserve of million for potential non recovery of electric power costs incurred to serve customers at scw s bear valley electric customer service area 
the reserves were established in to offset future impacts to earnings for the difference between authorized rates and scw s actual electric power costs under its supply agreements 
scw charged off million against this reserve in july against the balancing accounts 
the decrease was partially offset by increased reserves for self insured worker s compensation liabilities  higher labor and benefits related costs  and increased outside service expenses 
registrant anticipates that administrative and general costs will continue to increase reflecting  among other things  normal wage increases  increased costs for health  property and casualty insurance premiums  employee benefit programs  additional administrative and staff personnel  and costs associated with pursuit of additional business lines not subject to regulation 
registrant believes that prudent administrative expenses incurred in the operation and management of its regulated subsidiaries will be recovered through water and electric rates 
depreciation expense in increased by to million reflecting  among other things  the effects of recording approximately million in utility plant additions during  depreciation on which began in january registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies will be recovered through water and electric rates 
the comparison was also impacted by the elimination  effective january   of amortization of the goodwill recorded in awr s acquisition of ccwc 
during  amortization of this goodwill was  pursuant to financial and accounting standards board no 
 awr has determined that this goodwill was not impaired at january  and january  as compared to  maintenance expense increased by to million due principally to the termination of scw s cash preservation program cpp in august following the cpuc s approval of rate increases permitting scw to begin recovery of power costs incurred during the energy crisis of to serve customers of its bear valley electric division 
the cpp was initially implemented in to control costs and temporarily limit capital and maintenance expenditures principally to those projects that were believed necessary to meet public safety and health requirements or otherwise provide for continued service 
the cpp impacted both the electric and water businesses of scw 
in addition to maintenance routinely performed on registrant s facilities at its regulated subsidiaries  maintenance expense can be impacted by water main breaks or other incidents related to older infrastructure 
registrant s construction program is in part designed to minimize the impact the aging infrastructure has on maintenance costs 
taxes on income decreased by to million in as compared to million in due to an approximately decrease in pre tax operating income 
registrant estimates its taxes payable and exposure based on a variety of factors and judgments applied by management 

table of contents property and other tax expense increased slightly by in to million reflecting principally increased property taxes due to higher property valuation assessments  and higher payroll taxes based on increased labor costs 
other income loss as compared to  the change in other income reflects i the sale of a parcel of non operating property in scw s metropolitan customer service area in the first quarter of for which there was no equivalent sale in and resulted in a gain of approximately  and ii the write off of expenses associated with the termination of the acquisition of peerless water co 
in the fourth quarter of interest charges interest expense increased by in to million as compared to million recorded in due to the issuance of million in long term debt by scw in december  partially offset by a reduction in short term borrowing costs 
registrant anticipates that interest costs will increase in future periods due to the need for additional external capital to fund its construction program and to the likelihood that interest rates will increase at some future point 
registrant believes that costs associated with capital used to fund construction at its regulated subsidiaries will continue to be recovered in water and electric rates charged to customer 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of awr s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments of awr s management 
the need to make estimates about the effect of items that are uncertain is what makes these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex 
management makes subjective judgments about the accounting and regulatory treatment of many items
