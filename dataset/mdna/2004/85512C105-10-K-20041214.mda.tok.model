item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sale of the propane segment  prepayment of subsidiaries secured notes background on november   the partnership signed an agreement to sell its propane distribution and services segment  held largely through star gas propane  lp  to inergy for million  subject to certain adjustments 
following the partnership s press release of october  concerning the heating oil segment s borrowing problems  the partnership was approached by inergy regarding its interest in acquiring the partnership s propane segment 
in connection with addressing this possibility  the board of directors of the partnership s general partner formed a special committee comprised of two independent directors to determine whether a transaction would be fair to the non affiliated unitholders of the partnership as a whole 
the special committee  in turn  engaged separate financial and legal advisors to assist it 
the board monitored the negotiation with inergy and considered other possible alternatives  including a sale of less than all of the propane segment  a sale of the heating oil segment  a sale of the entire partnership and delaying any discussion regarding a sale and simply restructuring the debt of the partnership 
the special committee and full board considered the tax impact of the announced transaction and particularly why the sale of the propane segment would generate adverse tax consequences to a number of unitholders  particularly those that had held their units the longest 
the special committee and full board considered the likelihood of consummation of the transaction and the specific terms of the purchase agreement with inergy 
the agreement includes a provision permitting the partnership to terminate the agreement should a superior proposal be made for the propane segment or the partnership as a whole upon a payment of a breakup fee 
the analyses presented to the special committee and the board indicated that the sale of the propane segment would  by deleveraging the balance sheet of the partnership  likely advance the time when it would be possible for the partnership to resume regular distributions on the partnership s common units  at some level  although the special committee and full board understood that there could be no assurance that the partnership would make distributions on the common units  at any level  in the future 
the analyses also indicated that  irrespective of the sale of the propane segment  it is unlikely that the partnership will resume regular distributions to the senior subordinated and junior subordinated units for the foreseeable future 
after considering and partially in reliance on the advice of its advisors  the special committee unanimously determined that the sale of the propane segment to inergy on the terms described above was fair to the non affiliated unitholders of the partnership as a whole 
after considering the advice of their advisors and an analysis of the issues  the audit committee unanimously determined that the transaction was fair to the partnership  and the audit committee and the full board unanimously approved the execution of the agreement to sell the partnership s propane segment to inergy 
the partnership believes that the sale will improve the partnership s financial condition which should have the effect of increasing the heating oil segment s opportunities 

table of contents terms of the agreement 
general description 
the agreement with inergy contemplates that inergy will purchase the partnership s propane segment for million in cash  subject to adjustment without assumption of the propane segment s indebtedness for borrowed money at the time of sale 
the purchase price is subject to certain adjustments including a working capital adjustment 
the transaction is expected to close in late december for purposes of economic effect  the transaction will be effective as of november  and inergy will assume all profits subsequent to that date 
upon completion of the sale of the propane segment  the partnership will restate prior years results to include the results of the propane segment and the gain on the disposition as a component of discontinued operations 
no financing condition 
the purchaser s obligation to close is not conditioned on receipt of financing although the purchaser will need financing to complete the purchase 
general conditions 
the sale is conditioned on a number of customary closing conditions  including the passage of the applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  the filing for which was made on november  the agreement provides that the partnership will enter into a five year non competition agreement with respect to the propane segment in certain regions 
the agreement also provides for a breakup fee to inergy in the event that the partnership terminates the agreement because of a superior offer for the propane segment or the partnership enters into an agreement providing for the sale of the partnership in its entirety 
the partnership can terminate the agreement if the transaction does not close by december   and inergy can terminate the agreement if the transaction does not close by december  there can be no assurance that all of the conditions to closing will be met 
the partnership believes that no unitholder approval is required and none is going to be requested 
partnership status 
star gas will continue to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes after the sale of the propane segment 
nonetheless  because the heating oil business is held through a corporate subsidiary  following the sale nearly all of star gas earnings will be subject to corporate level income taxes  whereas prior to the sale most of the earnings from the propane business are not subject to entity level taxation 
by virtue of net operating loss carryforwards  the partnership does not anticipate that the corporate subsidiary will pay substantial federal income taxes for several years 
use of proceeds from the sale of the propane segment proceeds from the sale of the propane segment will be used to repay million that will be owing with respect to the secured notes at the partnership s subsidiaries  to repay outstanding borrowings under the propane segment s credit facilities  and to pay expenses related to the sale of the propane segment 
thereafter  pursuant to the terms of the indenture relating to the partnership s mlp notes  the partnership will be obligated  within days of the sale  to apply the net proceeds of the sale of the propane segment either to reduce indebtedness of the partnership or of a restricted subsidiary  or to make an investment in assets or capital expenditures useful to the partnership s or any subsidiary s business 
to the extent any net proceeds that are not so applied exceed million excess proceeds  the indenture requires the partnership to make an offer to all holders of mlp notes to purchase for cash that number of mlp notes that may be purchased with excess proceeds at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of mlp notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
the partnership cannot estimate the amount  if any  of excess proceeds that will result from the sale of the propane segment 
accordingly  the partnership cannot predict the size of any offer to purchase the mlp notes and whether or to what extent holders of mlp notes will accept the offer to purchase when made 
tax consequences to unitholders upon sale of the propane segment the partnership s unitholders will recognize gain or loss associated with the sale of the propane business based on a number of factors  including each individual holder s basis in the partnership units held  and the tax consequences of such sale will accrue to the record holders as of the date of the sale 
based on its preliminary calculations  in general the partnership estimates that  depending on the profile of the unitholder  the gain can be as high as approximately per common unit and loss as high as 
in general  the partnership anticipates that holders who have held units for a substantial period of time  particularly those who purchased units prior to  and those who purchased units at a low purchase price  will recognize the most gain 
a holder s tax basis in units will be increased by the amount of gain recognized 
if a holder sells units prior to the consummation of the sale of the propane business  such holder may recognize substantially less gain than would a holder who continues to hold through the date of consummation of the sale 
for additional information concerning the tax consequences to unitholders  see appendix a 

table of contents unitholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the application of tax laws to their particular situations 
prepayment of the partnership s subsidiaries secured notes on november   the partnership gave the holders of the heating oil segment s secured notes notice of prepayment of all of the notes on december  as contemplated by the note purchase agreements relating to the notes  the prepayment amount will be of the principal amount outstanding million  together with interest accrued thereon to the date of prepayment million and an estimated make whole amount million 
the partnership subsequently gave notice of the prepayment of the propane segment s secured notes 
the prepayment amount for the propane segment s secured notes will be of the outstanding principal amount million  together with accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment million and an estimated make whole amount million 
the aggregate amount payable for the heating oil segment s notes and the propane segment notes is approximately million 
these payments are expected to be made from either the proceeds of the sale of the propane segment or the jp morgan bank bridge facility 
amendments to partnership agreements the partnership has adopted certain amendments to its amended and restated agreement of limited partnership as well as certain amendments to the amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of star gas propane in order to permit the sale of the propane segment 

table of contents introduction to business seasonality the partnership s fiscal year ends on september all references to quarters and years in this document are to fiscal quarters and years unless otherwise noted 
the seasonal nature of the partnership s business results in the sale of approximately of its volume in the first quarter october through december and of its volume in the second quarter january through march of each year  the peak heating season  because propane and heating oil are primarily used for space heating in residential and commercial buildings 
the partnership generally realizes net income in both of these quarters and net losses during the quarters ending in june and september 
the partnership typically has negative working capital at september  due to seasonality 
in addition  sales volume typically fluctuates from year to year in response to variations in weather  wholesale energy prices and other factors 
gross profit is not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher margins than sales to other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographic region 
accordingly  gross profit margins could vary significantly from year to year in a period of identical sales volumes 
propane the propane segment is primarily engaged in the retail distribution of propane and related supplies and equipment to residential  commercial  industrial  agricultural and motor fuel customers 
customers are served from branch locations and satellite storage facilities in the midwest and northeast regions and florida and georgia 
in addition to its retail business  the segment also serves wholesale customers 
based on sales dollars  approximately of propane sales were to retail customers and approximately were to wholesale customers 
retail sales have historically had a greater profit margin  more stable customer base and less price sensitivity as compared to the wholesale business 
propane  also known as a liquid petroleum gas lpg ranks as the fourth most important source of residential heating in the united states  according to the us department of energy energy information administration  residential energy consumption survey 
excluding propane gas grills  residential and commercial demand accounts for approximately of all propane used in the united states 
of the million households in the united states  million households depend on propane 
because of these households rely on propane for their primary heating fuel  sales of propane are highly seasonal 
propane is most commonly used to provide energy to areas not serviced by the natural gas distribution system 
thus  it competes mainly with heating oil and electricity for space heating purposes 
residential customers are typically homeowners  while commercial customers include motels  restaurants  retail stores and laundromats 
industrial users  such as manufacturers  use propane as a heating and energy source in manufacturing and drying processes 
in addition  propane is used to supply heat for drying crops and as a fuel source for certain vehicles 
propane is extracted from natural gas at processing plants or separated from crude oil during the refining process 
it is normally transported and stored in a liquid state under moderate pressure or refrigeration for ease of handling in shipping and distribution 
when the pressure is released or the temperature is increased  propane is usable as a flammable gas 
propane is colorless and odorless  an odorant is added to allow its detection 
home heating oil home heating oil customers are served from locations in the northeast and mid atlantic regions  from which the heating oil segment delivers heating oil and other petroleum products and installs and repairs heating equipment hours a day  seven days a week  weeks a year 
these services are an integral part of its basic heating oil business  and are intended to maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty 
in fiscal  the heating oil segment s sales represented approximately of sales from home heating oil  from the installation and repair of heating and air conditioning equipment  and from the sale of other petroleum products  including diesel fuel and gasoline  to commercial customers 
in fiscal  sales to residential customers represented of the retail heating oil gallons sold and of heating oil gross profits 
heating oil can be used for residential and commercial heating purposes  and it is a significant source of fuel used to heat business and residences in the new england and mid atlantic regions 
according to the us department of energy energy information administration  residential energy consumption survey  these regions account for approximately of the households in the united states where heating oil is the main space heating fuel 
approximately of the homes in the region use heating oil as their main space heating fuel 
in recent years  demand for home heating oil has been affected by conservation efforts and conversions to natural gas 
in addition  as the number of new homes that use oil heat has not been significant  there has been virtually no increase in the customer base due to housing starts 

table of contents industry characteristics the retail propane and home heating oil industries are both mature  with total demand expected to remain relatively flat or to decline slightly 
the partnership believes that these industries are relatively stable and predictable due principally to the non discretionary nature of propane and home heating oil use 
accordingly  the demand for propane and home heating oil has historically been relatively unaffected by general economic conditions but has been a function of weather conditions 
it is common practice in both the propane and home heating oil distribution industries to price products to customers based on a per gallon margin over wholesale costs 
as a result  distributors generally seek to maintain their margins by passing wholesale costs through to customers  thus insulating themselves from the volatility in wholesale heating oil and propane prices 
however  during periods of sharp price fluctuations in supply costs  distributors may be unable or unwilling to pass the entire product cost increases or decreases through to customers 
in these cases  significant increases or decreases in per gallon margins may result 
in addition  the timing of cost pass throughs can significantly affect margins 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the propane and home heating oil distribution industries are highly fragmented  characterized by a large number of relatively small  independently owned and operated local distributors 
each year a significant number of these local distributors have sought to sell their business for reasons that include retirement and estate planning 
in addition  the propane and heating oil distribution industries are becoming more complex due to increasing environmental regulations and escalating capital requirements needed to acquire advanced  customer oriented technologies 
primarily as a result of these factors  both industries are undergoing consolidation  and the propane segment and the heating oil segment have been active consolidators in each of their markets 
recent acquisitions in fiscal  the partnership completed the purchase of three retail heating oil dealers for an aggregate of million and ten retail propane dealers for an aggregate of million

several locations sell bottled water and sell or lease water conditioning equipment 
typical branch locations consist of an office  an appliance showroom and a warehouse and service facility  with one or more  to  gallon bulk storage tanks 
satellite facilities typically contain only storage tanks 
the distribution of propane at the retail level for the most part involves large numbers of small deliveries averaging to gallons to each customer 
retail deliveries of propane are usually made to customers by means of the propane segment s fleet of bobtail and rack trucks 
currently the propane segment owns or leases a total of bobtail  boom and rack trucks 
propane is pumped from a bobtail truck  which generally holds  to  gallons  into a storage tank at the customer s premises 
the capacity of these tanks ranges from approximately gallons to approximately  gallons 
the propane segment also delivers propane to retail customers in portable cylinders  which typically are picked up and replenished at distribution locations  then returned to the retail customer 
to a lesser extent  the propane segment also delivers propane to certain end users of propane in larger trucks known as transports 
these trucks have an average capacity of approximately  gallons 
end users receiving transport deliveries include industrial customers  large scale heating accounts  such as local gas utilities that use propane as a supplemental fuel to meet peak demand requirements  and large agricultural accounts that use propane for crop drying and space heating 

table of contents customers during the last fiscal year  the propane segment s residential volume  excluding the impact of volume obtained through acquisitions  decreased due to attrition and other factors including consumer conservation and increased competition from low cost providers 
management expects some degree of attrition to continue in and perhaps beyond 
however  the propane segment has continued to grow through acquisitions and it completed ten acquisitions with approximately  customers and total annual volumes of million gallons during fiscal approximately of the propane segment s retail propane sales are made to residential customers and of retail propane sales are made to commercial and agricultural customers 
sales to residential customers in fiscal accounted for approximately of propane gross profit on propane sales  reflecting the higher margins of this segment of the market 
in excess of of the propane customers lease their tanks from the propane segment 
in most states  due to fire safety regulations  a leased tank may only be refilled by the propane distributor that owns that tank 
the inconvenience associated with switching tanks greatly reduces a propane customer s tendency to change distributors 
over half of the propane segment s residential customers receive their propane supply under an automatic delivery system 
the amount delivered is based on weather and historical consumption patterns 
the automatic delivery system eliminates the customer s need to make affirmative purchase decisions 
the propane segment provides emergency service hours a day  seven days a week  weeks a year 
competition the propane industry is highly competitive  however  long standing customer relationships are typical of the retail propane industry 
the ability to compete effectively within the propane industry depends on the reliability of service  responsiveness to customers and the ability to maintain competitive prices 
the propane segment believes that its superior service capabilities and customer responsiveness differentiates it from many of its competitors 
branch operations offer emergency service hours a day  seven days a week  weeks a year 
competition in the propane industry is highly fragmented and generally occurs on a local basis with other large full service multi state propane marketers  smaller local independent marketers and farm cooperatives 
according to lp gas magazine february  the ten largest multi state marketers  including the partnership s propane segment  account for approximately of the total retail sales of propane in the united states  and no single marketer has a greater than share of the total retail market in the united states 
most of the propane segment s branches compete with five or more marketers or distributors 
the principal factors influencing competition among propane marketers are price and service 
each branch operates in its own geographic market 
while retail marketers locate in close proximity to customers to lower the cost of providing delivery and service  the typical retail distribution outlet has an effective marketing radius of approximately miles 
propane competes primarily with electricity  natural gas and fuel oil as an energy source on the basis of price  availability and portability 
propane is generally more expensive than natural gas  but serves as an alternative to natural gas in rural and suburban areas where natural gas is unavailable or portability of product is required 
the expansion of natural gas into traditional propane markets has historically been inhibited by the capital costs required to expand distribution and pipeline systems 
although the extension of natural gas pipelines tends to displace propane distribution in the areas affected  the partnership believes that new opportunities for propane sales arise as more geographically remote areas are developed 
although propane is similar to fuel oil in space heating and water heating applications  as well as in market demand and price  propane and fuel oil have generally developed their own distinct geographic markets 
because furnaces that burn propane will not operate on fuel oil  a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment 

table of contents home heating oil segment operations the partnership s heating oil segment serves over  customers in the northeast and mid atlantic regions 
in addition to selling home heating oil  the heating oil segment installs  maintains and repairs heating and air conditioning equipment 
to a limited extent  it also markets other petroleum products 
during the months ended september   the total sales in the heating oil segment were comprised of approximately from sales of home heating oil  from the installation and repair of heating equipment  and from the sale of other petroleum products 
the heating oil segment provides home heating equipment repair service hours a day  seven days a week  weeks a year 
it also regularly provides various incentives to obtain and retain customers 
the heating oil segment is consolidating its operations under two primary brand names  petro and meenan  which it is building by employing an upgraded sales force  together with a professionally developed integrated marketing campaign  including broadcast and print advertising media  including direct mail 
the heating oil segment has a nationwide toll free telephone number  oil heat  which it believes helps facilitate customer needs 
the heating oil segment is seeking to take advantage of its large size and to utilize modern technology to increase the efficiency and quality of services provided to its customers 
the segment is seeking to create a more customer oriented service approach to significantly differentiate itself from its competitors 
a core business process redesign project began in fiscal with an exhaustive effort to identify customer expectations and document existing business processes 
these findings led to a conclusion that improved processes  consolidation of operations  technology investments and selective outsourcing could have a meaningful impact on improving customer services while reducing annual operating costs 
the partnership believes the technology it employs can improve the efficiency and quality of services provided to its heating oil customers 
the heating oil segment has now deployed second generation hand held devices for the automation of its service workforce 
these wireless handheld data terminals allow service and installation professionals on demand access to customer repair history  data to provide instant part and repair quotations  the ability to invoice at the completion of service and identify customer service issues 
consolidation of certain heating oil operational activities have been undertaken to create operating efficiencies and cost savings 
service technicians are being dispatched from two consolidated locations rather than local offices which was previously the case 
oil delivery is now being managed from regional locations rather than local offices 
the organization continues to adjust to these significant operational changes 
the partnership has recently completed a transition to outsourcing in the area of customer contact management as both a customer satisfaction and a cost reduction strategy 
the partnership hopes outsourcing customer inquiries through a centralized call center may improve performance  service and leverage the technology to eliminate system redundancy available from third party service organizations 
in addition  an outsourcing partner has greater flexibility to manage extreme seasonal volume 
the complexity of customer interactions combined with the partnership s goal for service excellence has led to protracted training and implementation efforts 
during fiscal  the heating oil segment experienced startup operational problems with its centralized call center and equipment service dispatch  which the partnership believes contributed to an increase in customer attrition 
the heating oil segment believes that it has made progress in correcting these operational problems

table of contents customers during the months ended september   approximately of the heating oil segment s heating oil sales were made to homeowners  with the remainder to industrial  commercial and institutional customers 
over the three fiscal years  ended september   the heating oil segment experienced average annual attrition of approximately  excluding the impact of acquisitions 
during fiscal  the heating oil segment experienced annual customer attrition of  excluding the impact of acquisitions 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the partnership believes this segment s attrition rate has risen because of greater than normal price competition related to the unprecedented rise in oil prices and because of startup operational problems associated with the business process redesign project  primarily caused by the transition to a centralized call center 
prior to the winter heating season  the heating oil segment attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service  and as part of that effort  centralized its heating equipment service dispatch and engaged a centralized call center to fulfill its telephone requirements 
the implementation of this initiative is taking longer and incurring greater difficulties than the heating oil segment had anticipated  which adversely impacted the customer base 
in addition  management s decision to upgrade the credit quality of its customer base and reduce related bad debt also contributed to the increased customer loss 
while the partnership believes that the heating oil segment has made progress in correcting the early inefficiencies associated with its centralized customer service  and that it has significantly improved its responsiveness to customer needs  the partnership expects that customer attrition will likely continue at a rate higher than experienced in each of the three years ended september  into the winter heating season and the attrition will adversely impact volume during and perhaps beyond 
customer losses are the result of various factors  including customer relocation  price  natural gas conversions  service issues and credit problems 
customer gains are a result of marketing and service programs 
while the heating oil segment often loses customers when they move from their homes  it is able to retain a majority of these homes by obtaining the purchaser as a customer 
approximately of the heating oil customers receive their home heating oil under an automatic delivery system without the customer having to make an affirmative purchase decision 
these deliveries are scheduled by computer  based upon each customer s historical consumption patterns and prevailing weather conditions 
the heating oil segment delivers home heating oil approximately six times during the year to the average customer 
the segment s practice is to bill customers promptly after delivery 
approximately of its customers are on a budget payment plan  whereby their estimated annual oil purchases and service contract are paid for in a series of equal monthly payments 
on each of september  and september   approximately of the heating oil customers had agreements establishing a fixed or maximum price per gallon over a month period price plan customers 
this percentage could increase or decrease during fiscal based upon market conditions 
the fixed or maximum price per gallon at which home heating oil is sold to these price plan customers is generally renegotiated based on current market conditions at the beginning of each heating season 
the heating oil segment currently enters into derivative instruments futures  options  collars and swaps in order to hedge a majority of the heating oil it expects to sell to price plan customers 
the heating oil segment uses these fixed price derivative instruments to mitigate its exposure to changing commodity prices 
competition the heating oil segment competes with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices  from full service distributors  like itself  to those offering delivery only 
long standing customer relationships are typical in the industry 
like most companies in the home heating oil business  the heating oil segment provides home heating equipment repair service on a hour a day  seven days a week  weeks a year basis 
this tends to build customer loyalty 
as a result of these factors  it is difficult for the heating oil segment to acquire new retail customers  other than through acquisitions 
in some instances homeowners have formed buying cooperatives that seek to purchase fuel oil from distributors at a price lower than individual customers are otherwise able to obtain 
the heating oil segment also competes for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products  principally natural gas  propane  and electricity 
the rate of conversion from the use of home heating oil to natural gas is primarily affected by the relative retail prices of the two products and the cost of replacing an oil fired heating system with one that uses natural gas  in addition to environmental concerns 
the partnership believes that approximately of its home heating oil customer base annually converts from home heating oil to natural gas 

table of contents suppliers and supply arrangements propane segment the propane segment obtains propane from over sources  including bp canada energy marketing corp  chs  inc  centennial gas liquid  llc  dawson oil company ltd  duke energy ngl services  lp  dynegy inc  enterprise products partners  kinetic resources  usa  marathon oil company  markwest hydrocarbons and transammonia inc supplies from these sources have traditionally been readily available  although there is no assurance that supplies of propane will continue to be readily available 
the majority of the propane supply is purchased under annual or longer term supply contracts that generally provide for pricing in accordance with market prices at the time of delivery 
some of the contracts provide for minimum and maximum amounts of propane to be purchased 
the product supplied for the contracts come from refineries  gas processing plants and bulk purchases at the mont belvieu trading and storage complex 
most of the bulk purchases at mont belvieu are physically moved through the teppco partners  lp pipeline system  to both the seymour underground storage facility  which the partnership owns and leases to teppco partners  lp in southern indiana  and north into the pennsylvania and new york areas to supplement purchases made by the segment in the northeast region 
this lease agreement provides the propane segment the ability to store at all times throughout the terms of this agreement million gallons of product storage or approximately of the propane segment s annual supply requirements  along the teppco partners  lp pipeline system 
the seymour facility is located on the teppco partners  lp pipeline system 
the pipeline is connected to the mont belvieu  texas storage facilities and is one of the largest conduits of supply for the us propane industry 
the partnership believes that its diversification of suppliers will enable it to purchase all of its supply needs at market prices if supplies are interrupted from any of these sources without a material disruption of its operations 
the partnership also believes that relations with its current suppliers are satisfactory 
the propane segment purchases derivative instruments in order to mitigate its exposure to market risk and hedge the cash flow variability associated with forecasted purchases of propane held for resale to price plan customers

this due diligence includes questioning the seller  obtaining representations and warranties concerning the seller s compliance with environmental laws and performing site assessments 
during this due diligence the partnership s employees  and  in certain cases  independent environmental consulting firms review historical records and databases and conduct physical investigations of the property to look for evidence of hazardous substances  compliance violations and the existence of underground storage tanks 
future developments  such as stricter environmental  health or safety laws and regulations thereunder  could affect partnership operations 
it is not anticipated that the partnership s compliance with or liabilities under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including cercla  will have a material adverse effect on the partnership 
to the extent that there are any environmental liabilities unknown to the partnership or environmental  health or safety laws or regulations are made more stringent  there can be no assurance that the partnership s results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents risk factors an investment in the partnership involves a high degree of risk 
investors should carefully review the following risk factors concerning the partnership 
if the partnership completes the sale of its propane segment  the risk factors relating to the propane segment that are discussed below would no longer be applicable to the partnership 
the partnership s heating oil segment has liquidity issues that raise questions concerning the partnership s ability to continue as a going concern 
the partnership s heating oil segment has liquidity issues relating to the heating oil segment s inability to comply with the borrowing conditions under its current credit agreement that raises questions concerning the partnership s ability to continue as a going concern 
the report of the partnership s independent registered public accounting firm on the partnership s consolidated financial statements as of september  and  and for the three years ended september   includes an explanatory paragraph with respect to these liquidity issues 
the partnership believes that the closing of the refinancing transactions discussed above  and the sale of the propane segment  will satisfactorily address these liquidity issues 
the partnership s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
if the partnership is unable to close the new revolving credit facility and either the bridge facility or the sale of the propane segment by december   the partnership would be unable to find other sources of financing before december  to refinance the heating oil segment s and propane segment s credit facilities and to repay the heating oil segment s and propane segment s institutional indebtedness  which are due and payable on such date 
in such event if the partnership were not able to obtain such alternative sources of financing and is not successful in rescheduling the maturity dates of such indebtedness  the partnership may be forced to seek the protection of the bankruptcy courts 
the sale of the propane segment may adversely affect the partnership s future operating results on november   the partnership signed an agreement to sell its propane distribution and services business for a purchase price of million  subject to adjustment 
for the fiscal year ended september   the propane segment accounted for million of the partnership s sales and million of the partnership s operating income 
for more information on the results of operations of the propane segment  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if the propane segment is sold  the loss of the propane business operating income could adversely affect the partnership s future operating results 
the partnership s substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair its financial condition and its ability to fulfill its debt obligations 
after giving effect to the refinancing transactions and sale of the propane segment  and before the application of excess proceeds to purchase mlp notes  the partnership s total debt would have been approximately million as of september  compared to million on an actual basis 
if the partnership does not sell the propane segment  its total debt on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the refinancing transactions would have been approximately million as of september  see item management s discussions and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the partnership s substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could impair its ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes  result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates since some of its debt is  and will continue to be  at variable rates of interest  have a material adverse effect on it if the partnership fails to comply with financial and affirmative and restrictive covenants in its debt agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of a failure that is not cured or waived  require it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to payments on its indebtedness and other financial obligations  thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures  limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which the partnership operates  and place it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have proportionately less debt 
if the partnership is unable to meet its debt service obligations and other financial obligations  it could be forced to restructure or refinance its indebtedness and other financial transactions  seek additional equity capital or sell its assets 
the partnership may then be unable to obtain such financing or capital or sell its assets on satisfactory terms  if at all 

table of contents since weather conditions may adversely affect the demand for propane and home heating oil  the partnership s financial condition is vulnerable to warm winters 
weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for both propane and home heating oil because the partnership s customers depend on these products principally for space heating purposes 
as a result  weather conditions may materially adversely impact the partnership s operating results and financial condition 
during the peak heating season of october through march  sales of propane represent approximately to of the partnership s annual retail propane volume and sales of home heating oil represent approximately to of the partnership s annual home heating oil volume 
actual weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year  significantly affecting the partnership s financial performance 
furthermore  warmer than normal temperatures in one or more regions in which the partnership operates can significantly decrease the total volume the partnership sells and the gross profit realized on those sales and  consequently  the partnership s results of operations 
for example  in fiscal and especially fiscal  temperatures were significantly warmer than normal for the areas in which the partnership sells propane and home heating oil  which adversely affected the amount of ebitda that it generated during these periods 
in fiscal year  temperatures in the partnership s areas of operation were an average of warmer than in fiscal year and warmer than normal 
the partnership has purchased weather insurance to help minimize the adverse effect of weather volatility on its cash flows  of which there can be no assurance 
weather variations also affect demand for propane from agricultural customers  because dry weather during the harvest season reduces demand for propane used in crop drying 
the partnership s operating results will be adversely affected if the heating oil segment and propane segment experience significant customer losses that are not offset or reduced by customer gains 
the heating oil segment s net attrition of home heating oil customers averaged approximately per year over the three years through this rate represents the net of its annual customer loss rate 
for fiscal  the heating oil segment s net customer attrition  after adjusting for customer acquisitions  was approximately 
customer losses are the result of various factors  including customer relocations  supplier changes based primarily on price and service  natural gas conversions  and credit problems 
the continuing unprecedented rise in the price of heating oil has intensified price competition which has adversely impacted the heating oil segment s margins and added to the heating oil segment s difficulties in reducing customer attrition 
the heating oil segment believes its attrition rate has risen not only because of increased price competition related to the rise in oil prices but also because of operational problems 
prior to the winter heating season  the heating oil segment attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service  and as part of that effort  centralized its heating equipment service dispatch and engaged a centralized call center to fulfill its telephone requirements 
the implementation of this initiative is taking longer and incurring greater difficulties than the heating oil segment had anticipated  which adversely impacted the customer base 
while the partnership believes that the heating oil segment has made progress in correcting the early inefficiencies associated with its customer service  and that it has improved its responsiveness to customer needs  the partnership expects that attrition will  at least to some extent  continue into the winter heating season and perhaps beyond 
the partnership notes that even to the extent that attrition can be halted  the current reduced customer base will adversely impact net income for fiscal and perhaps beyond 
for fiscal  the propane segment s net customer attrition  after adjusting for customer acquisition  was approximately 
the heating oil segment and propane segment may not be able to achieve net gains of customers and may continue to experience customer attrition in the future 

table of contents sudden and sharp oil and propane price increases that cannot be passed on to customers may adversely affect the partnership s operating results 
the retail propane and home heating oil industries are margin based businesses in which gross profits depend on the excess of retail sales prices over supply costs 
consequently  the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in wholesale prices of propane and heating oil caused by changes in supply or other market conditions 
many of these factors are beyond the partnership s control and thus  when there are sudden and sharp increases in the wholesale costs of propane and heating oil  the partnership may not be able to pass on these increases to its customers through retail sales prices 
as of september   the wholesale cost of home heating oil  as measured by the closing price of the new york mercantile exchange had increased by to per gallon from per gallon as of june  this represents a increase over the heating oil price per gallon of per gallon on september  per gallon heating oil prices subsequently increased to a high of per gallon on october   before retreating to per gallon as of december  when heating oil prices increased  in the fourth quarter of fiscal the heating oil segment s retail sales prices did not increase as rapidly as the increase in heating oil prices  which resulted in lower per gallon margins 
in addition  the timing of cost pass throughs can significantly affect margins 
wholesale price increases could reduce the partnership s gross profits and could  if continuing over an extended period of time  reduce demand by encouraging conservation or conversion to alternative energy sources 
a significant portion of the partnership s home heating oil and propane volume is sold to price protected heating oil only customers and its operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the cost of supply that the partnership cannot pass on to these customers or otherwise protect against 
a significant portion of its home heating oil volume is sold to individual customers under an agreement pre establishing the maximum sales price or a fixed price of home heating oil over a month period 
the maximum price at which home heating oil is sold to these price protected customers is generally renegotiated prior to the heating season of each year based on current market conditions 
the partnership currently enters into forward purchase contracts  futures contracts and option contracts for a substantial majority of the heating oil the partnership sells to these price protected customers in advance and at a fixed cost 
should events occur after a price protected sales price is established that increase the cost of home heating oil above the amount anticipated  margins for the price protected customers whose heating oil was not purchased in advance would be lower than expected  while those customers whose heating oil was purchased in advance would be unaffected 
conversely  should events occur during this period that decrease the cost of heating oil below the amount anticipated  margins for the price protected customers whose heating oil was purchased in advance could be lower than expected  while margins for those customers whose heating oil was not purchased in advance would be unaffected or higher than expected 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of its retail home heating oil volume sales and approximately of its retail propane volume sales were under a price protected plan 
if the partnership does not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  its future financial performance will be limited 
neither the propane nor the home heating oil industry is a growth industry because of increased competition from alternative energy sources 
a significant portion of the partnership s growth in the past decade has been directly tied to its acquisition programs 
accordingly  its future financial performance will be impacted by its ability to continue to make acquisitions at attractive prices 
the partnership cannot be assured that it will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates in the future or that the partnership will be able to acquire businesses on economically acceptable terms if at all 
in particular the financial resources available to the partnership are likely to be limited 
factors that may adversely affect the partnership s propane and home heating oil segments operating and financial results  such as warm weather patterns  may further limit its access to capital and adversely affect its ability to make acquisitions 
any acquisition may involve risks  including an increase in its indebtedness  the inability to integrate the operations of the acquired business  the inability to successfully expand its operations into new territories  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and an excess of customer loss or loss of key employees from the acquired business 
in addition  acquisitions may be dilutive to earnings and distributions to the unitholders and any additional debt incurred to finance acquisitions may affect the partnership s ability to make distributions to the unitholders 

table of contents because of the highly competitive nature of the retail propane and home heating oil segments  the partnership may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers  which would have an adverse impact on its operating results and financial condition 
if both the propane and home heating oil segments are unable to compete effectively  the partnership may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers  which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
many of the propane competitors and potential competitors are larger or have substantially greater financial resources than the partnership does  which may provide them with some advantages 
generally  competition in the past few years has intensified  partly as a result of warmer than normal weather 
most of the propane segment s retail branch locations compete with five or more marketers or distributors 
the principal factors influencing competition with other retail marketers are price  reliability and quality of service  responsiveness to customer needs  safety concerns  long standing customer relationships  the inconvenience of switching tanks and suppliers  and the lack of growth in the industry 
the partnership s home heating oil business competes with heating oil distributors offering a broad range of services and prices  from full service distributors  like the heating oil segment  to those offering delivery only 
competition with other companies in the home heating oil industry is based primarily on customer service and price with some of the heating oil segment s competitors historically offering lower prices than this segment 
long standing customer relationships are typical in the industry 
it is customary for companies to deliver home heating oil to their customers based upon weather conditions and historical consumption patterns  without the customer making an affirmative purchase decision 
most companies provide home heating equipment repair service on a hour per day basis 
in some cases  homeowners have formed buying cooperatives to purchase fuel oil from distributors at a price lower than individual customers are otherwise able to obtain 
as a result of these factors  it may be difficult for the heating oil segment to acquire new customers 
the increase in price competition resulting from the continuing unprecedented rise in the price of heating oil has adversely impacted the heating oil segment s ability to retain customers and attract new customers 
the heating oil segment believes its attrition rate had risen not only because of the rise in oil prices but also because of operational problems 
prior to the winter heating season  the heating oil segment attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service  and as part of that effort  centralized its heating equipment service dispatch and engaged a centralized call center to fulfill its telephone requirements 
the implementation of this initiative is taking longer and incurring greater difficulties than the heating oil segment had anticipated  which adversely impacted the customer base 
while the partnership believes that the heating oil segment has made progress in correcting the early inefficiencies associated with its customer service  and that it has significantly improved its responsiveness to customer needs  the partnership expects that attrition will continue into the winter heating season and perhaps beyond 
the partnership can make no assurances that it will be able to compete successfully on the basis of these factors 
if a competitor attempts to increase market share by reducing prices  the partnership s operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the home heating oil segment also competes for customers with suppliers of alternative energy products  principally natural gas 
in addition  competition from alternative energy sources has been increasing as a result of reduced regulation of many utilities  including natural gas and electricity 
the partnership could face additional price competition from alternative heating sources such as electricity and natural gas as a result of deregulation in those industries 
over the past five years  conversions by the heating oil segment s customers from heating oil to other sources have averaged approximately per year of the homes it serves 

table of contents energy efficiency and new technology may reduce the demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results 
increased conservation and technological advances  including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and other heating devices  have adversely affected the demand for the partnership s products by retail customers 
future conservation measures or technological advances in heating  conservation  energy generation or other devices might reduce demand and adversely affect our operating results 
the partnership is subject to operating and litigation risks that could adversely affect its operating results to the extent not covered by insurance 
the partnership s operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling  storing  transporting and otherwise providing customers with combustible or flammable liquids such as propane and home heating oil 
as a result  the partnership may be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
the partnership maintains insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverages and deductibles as it believes are reasonable 
however  there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate to protect the partnership from all material expenses related to potential future claims for remediation costs and personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 
in addition  the occurrence of an explosion  whether or not the partnership is involved  may have an adverse effect on the public s desire to use its products 
the partnership is the subject of a number of class action lawsuits alleging violation of the federal securities laws  which if decided adversely to it could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition 
on or about october   a purported class action lawsuit on behalf of a purported class of unitholders was filed against the partnership and various subsidiaries and officers and directors in the united states district court of the district of connecticut carter v

the class action plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages including interest against the defendants jointly and severally and an award of reasonable costs and expenses 
the partnership will defend against the class actions vigorously 
however  the partnership is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits at this time 
in the event that one or more of the above actions were decided adversely to the partnership  it could have a material effect on the partnership s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 

table of contents the partnership s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by governmental regulation and associated environmental and regulatory costs 
the home heating oil business is subject to a wide range of federal and state laws and regulations related to environmental and other regulated matters 
the heating oil segment has implemented environmental programs and policies designed to avoid potential liability and costs under applicable environmental laws 
it is possible  however  that the heating oil segment will have increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from noncompliance with operating or other regulatory permits 
new environmental regulations might adversely impact the heating oil segment s operations  including underground storage and transportation of home heating oil 
in addition  the environmental risks inherently associated with the home heating oil operations  such as the risks of accidental release or spill  are greater than those associated with the partnership s propane operations 
it is possible that material costs and liabilities will be incurred  including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons 
in the partnership s acquisition of meenan  the partnership assumed all of meenan s environmental liabilities 
in the partnership s acquisition of meenan oil company  or meenan  in august  the partnership assumed all of meenan s environmental liabilities  including those related to the cleanup of contaminated properties  in consideration of a reduction of the purchase price of million 
subsequent to closing  the partnership established an additional reserve of million to cover potential costs associated with remediating known environmental liabilities  bringing the total reserve to million 
to date  remediation expenses against this reserve have totaled million 
while the partnership believes this reserve will be adequate  it is possible that the extent of the contamination at issue or the expense of addressing it could exceed the partnership s estimates and thus the costs of remediating these known liabilities could materially exceed the amounts reserved 
conflicts of interest have arisen and could arise in the future as a result of relationships between the general partner and its affiliates  on the one hand  and star gas propane or the partnership and its limited partners  on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts the general partner may favor its own interests and those of its affiliates over the interests of the unitholders 
the nature of these conflicts is ongoing and includes the following considerations except for irik p 
sevin  who is subject to a non competition agreement  the general partner s affiliates are not prohibited from engaging in other business or activities  including direct competition with the partnership 
the general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  capital expenditures  borrowings and reserves  each of which can impact the amount of cash that is distributed to unitholders of the partnership and available to pay the notes 
the general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to the partnership by the general partner 
the general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for the partnership 
in some instances the general partner may borrow funds in order to permit the payment of distributions to the unitholders of the partnership 
the risk of terrorism and political unrest in the middle east may adversely affect the economy and the price and availability of home heating oil and propane 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   and political unrest in the middle east may adversely impact the price and availability of home heating oil and propane  the partnership s results of operations  its ability to raise capital and its future growth 
the impact that the foregoing may have on the partnership s industry in general  and on the partnership in particular  is not known at this time 
an act of terror could result in disruptions of crude oil or natural gas supplies and markets  the sources of home heating oil and propane  and its facilities could be direct or indirect targets 
terrorist activity may also hinder the partnership s ability to transport propane if its means of transportation become damaged as a result of an attack 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism could also affect the partnership s ability to raise capital 
terrorist activity could likely lead to increased volatility in prices for home heating oil and propane 
insurance carriers are routinely excluding coverage for terrorist activities from their normal policies  but are required to offer such coverage as a result of new federal legislation 
the partnership has opted to purchase this coverage with respect to its property and casualty insurance programs 
this additional coverage has resulted in additional insurance premiums 

table of contents cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with the partnership s performance and reserve requirements because distributions on the common and subordinated units and partnership securities are dependent on the amount of cash generated  distributions may fluctuate based on the partnership s performance 
the actual amount of cash that is available will depend upon numerous factors  including profitability of operations  required principal and interest payments on debt  cost of acquisitions  issuance of debt and equity securities  fluctuations in working capital  capital expenditures  adjustments in reserves  prevailing economic conditions  and financial  business and other factors 
some of these factors are beyond the control of the general partner 
the partnership agreement gives the general partner discretion in establishing reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership s business 
these reserves will also affect the amount of cash available for distribution 
the general partner may establish reserves for distributions on the senior subordinated units only if those reserves will not prevent the partnership from distributing the full minimum quarterly distribution  plus any arrearages  on the common units for the following four quarters 
on october   the partnership announced that it would not pay a distribution on the common units as a result of the requirements of its bank lenders 
the partnership had previously announced the suspension of distributions on the senior subordinated units on july

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the partnership s expectations cautionary statements are disclosed in this report  including without limitation and in conjunction with the forward looking statements included in this report 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the partnership or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
recent events on october   the partnership announced that it had advised the heating oil segment s bank lenders that this segment would not be able to make the required representations included in the borrowing certificate under its working capital line 
in addition  the partnership notified such lenders that  for the quarter ending december  and for the foreseeable future thereafter  the heating oil segment will be unlikely to satisfy the drawing condition that requires that the consolidated funded debt of the partnership not exceed times its consolidated operating cash flow 
further  the partnership advised the lenders that the heating oil segment may not be able to maintain a zero balance under the working capital facility except for letter of credit obligations for consecutive days from april  to september   as required by the heating oil segment s covenants 
the partnership indicated that the source of the problem is a combination of a the inability to pass on the full impact of record heating oil prices to customers and b the effects of unusually high customer attrition principally related to the heating oil segment s operational restructuring undertaken in the past months 
the partnership also announced that it anticipated that because of the requirements of the partnership s current and potential bank lenders  it will not be permitted to make any distributions on its common units 
in addition  the partnership announced that the heating oil segment s bank lenders had agreed to permit the heating oil segment to request new working capital advances daily while the partnership was in discussions with such lenders about modifying the terms and conditions of the heating oil segment s credit agreement 
in connection with that understanding  the bank lenders requested that the partnership allow an independent financial advisor to review the heating oil segment s operations and performance on their behalf 
on november   the partnership announced that the heating oil segment had entered into a letter amendment and waiver under its credit agreement 
as a result of the amendment  the heating oil segment was able to continue to borrow funds under the credit agreement to support its working capital requirements for the near term 
the amendment provides for the waiver  through december   of various terms under the credit agreement 
the amendment also amends for the waiver period the financial covenant regarding the partnership s consolidated funded debt to cash flow ratio and the financial covenant regarding the heating oil segment s cash flow to interest expense ratio 
the partnership also announced that its propane segment had entered into a commitment letter with jpmorgan securities inc and jpmorgan chase bank 
under the commitment letter  as amended  jp morgan chase bank committed  subject to certain conditions to provide a million million if the propane segment is sold  as discussed below asset based senior secured revolving credit facility referred to herein as the revolving credit facility and a million senior secured bridge facility referred to herein as the bridge facility to refinance the refinancing transactions all of the heating oil segment and the propane segment s working capital facilities if the propane segment is not sold and senior secured notes 

table of contents on november   the partnership announced that it had signed an agreement to sell its propane segment  held largely through star gas propane to inergy  the operating subsidiary of inergy  lp  for million  subject to certain adjustments 
in addition  the partnership gave notice to holders of the heating oil segment s secured notes of its optional election to prepay such secured notes  representing an aggregate payment  including principal  interest and estimated premium  of approximately million 
the partnership subsequently gave notice of its optional election to prepay its propane segment s secured notes involving an aggregate payment including principal  interest and estimated premium  of approximately million 
the aggregate amount payable with regard to both sets of secured notes is approximately million 
as discussed elsewhere herein  these payments are expected to be made from either the proceeds of the sale of the propane segment or the jp morgan chase bridge facility 
for additional information concerning the sale of the propane segment  see item business sale of the propane segment  prepayment of subsidiaries secured notes 
if the sale of the propane business to inergy is not consummated for any reason by december   the partnership s commitment from jp morgan chase will remain unaffected 
on that date  the partnership would expect to draw down jp morgan chase s bridge facility if the propane segment sale has not been consummated 
the proceeds from the bridge facility would be used to repay the partnership s subsidiaries secured notes which will become due on that date because of the partnership s notice of prepayment 
the partnership also would expect to close on that date the asset based revolving credit agreement underwritten by jp morgan chase to replace the existing revolving credit agreements of the partnership s subsidiaries 
therefore  the partnership will be able to restructure its indebtedness as disclosed in the partnership s previous press release dated november   provided that it is able to satisfy the conditions in the jp morgan chase commitment 
the jp morgan chase commitment for the bridge facility and the revolving credit facility is subject to a number of conditions and there can be no assurance that the partnership will meet those conditions 
see liquidity and capital resources financing and sources of liquidity following refinancing transactions 
if the propane segment is sold either before or after december   the revolving credit facility will be reduced to million and the liens on all of the assets of the propane segment would be released 
if the sale of the propane segment does not close until after the partnership has drawn down on the bridge facility  the partnership will use a portion of the sales proceeds to repay the bridge loan 
the remaining proceeds will be applied in accordance with the terms of the indenture relating to the partnership s mlp notes  which is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources financing and sources of liquidity following refinancing transactions 
if the agreement for the sale of the propane segment is terminated  the partnership will seek to repay the bridge facility through the issuance of senior secured notes issued by the heating oil segment and the propane segment in a public or private offering 
results of operations overview in analyzing the partnership s financial results  the following matters should be considered 
the partnership s fiscal year ends on september all references to quarters and years respectively in this document are to fiscal quarters and years unless otherwise noted 
the seasonal nature of the partnership s business results in the sale of approximately of its volume in the first quarter october through december and of its volume in the second quarter january through march of each year  the peak heating season  because propane and heating oil are primarily used for space heating in residential and commercial buildings 
the partnership generally realizes net income in both of these quarters and net losses during the quarters ending june and september 
the partnership typically has negative working capital at the end of each fiscal year due to seasonality 
in addition  sales volume typically fluctuates from year to year in response to variations in weather  wholesale energy prices and other factors 
gross profit is not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher margins than sales to other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographic region 
accordingly  gross profit margins could vary significantly from year to year in a period of identical sales volumes 
as discussed below under the heading cost of product  when heating oil wholesale costs increased  the heating oil segment s retail sales prices did not increase as rapidly as the increase in heating oil prices  which resulted in lower per gallon margins 
in general  the timing of cost pass throughs can significantly affect margins 

table of contents as of september   the wholesale cost of home heating oil  as measured by the closing price of the new york mercantile exchange had increased by to from on june  this represents a increase over the heating oil price per gallon of on september  per gallon heating oil prices subsequently increased to a high of per gallon on october   before retreating to per gallon as of december  the unprecedented rise in the wholesale price of heating oil has adversely impacted the heating oil segment s margins and added to the heating oil segment s difficulties in both attracting new and retaining existing customers 
the heating oil segment believes its rate of customer loss has risen not only because of the greater than normal price competition resulting from the rise in oil prices but also because of operational problems in the heating oil segment and management s decision to upgrade the credit quality of its customer base 
prior to the winter heating season  the heating oil segment attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service and  as part of that effort  centralized the heating equipment service and oil dispatch functions and engaged a centralized call center to fulfill its telephone requirements 
the implementation of this initiative is taking longer and incurring greater difficulties than the heating oil segment had anticipated  which adversely impacted the customer base 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  the heating oil segment experienced annual customer attrition of approximately excluding the impact of acquisitions 
for fiscal  before the increase in the price of home heating oil and the full implementation of the business process improvement program  the rate of customer loss was approximately 
while the partnership believes that the heating oil segment has made progress in correcting the early inefficiencies associated with its customer service  and that it has improved its responsiveness to customer needs  the partnership expects that attrition will continue into the winter heating season and perhaps beyond 
the partnership notes that even to the extent that attrition can be halted  the current reduced customer base will adversely impact net income for fiscal and perhaps beyond 
the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the partnership and its subsidiaries  and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the partnership completed the sale of its tg e subsidiaries in march the following discussion reflects the historical results for the tg e segment as discontinued operations 
also  on november   the partnership signed an agreement for the sale of its propane segment 
upon final consummation of this transaction  the propane segment will be reflected as a discontinued operation and the historical statements will be reclassified to reflect this presentation

table of contents volume for fiscal  retail volume of home heating oil and propane increased million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for fiscal an analysis by segment is found below in millions of gallons heating oil segment propane segment total volume fiscal impact of warmer temperatures impact of acquisitions net customer attrition other change volume fiscal retail volume sold in the heating oil segment declined by million gallons  or  to million gallons for fiscal  as compared to million gallons for fiscal we believe that this million gallon decline at the heating oil segment was due to the impact of warmer temperatures and net customer attrition partially offset by acquisitions and other volume changes 
net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through internal marketing efforts 
customers added through acquisitions do not impact the calculation of net attrition 
temperatures in the heating oil segment s geographic areas of operations were warmer in fiscal than in fiscal and approximately warmer than normal as reported by the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa 
at september   after adjusting for acquisitions  the heating oil segment estimates that it had approximately fewer home heating oil customers than as of september  for the quarter ended september   the heating oil segment excluding acquisitions lost approximately  customers net as compared to the quarter ended september   in which the heating oil segment lost approximately  customers net 
we believe that net customer attrition is the result of various factors including but not limited to price  service and credit 
the continued rise in the price of heating oil  especially during the fourth quarter of fiscal  added to the heating oil segment s difficulties in reducing customer attrition 
the partnership believes that the unprecedented rise in heating oil prices has increased the competitive pressures facing its heating oil segment 
as wholesale prices have risen  many of the partnership s competitors have not raised their retail prices to fully offset the wholesale price rise 
in an effort to minimize the loss of customers to price competition  the partnership has also not increased its prices to fully offset for the rise in wholesale prices  resulting in reduced margins 
nevertheless  many of the partnership s competitors appear to have succeeded in inducing the partnership s customers to leave through various price related strategies 
the partnership believes that going forward it may need to be even more sensitive to price competition  resulting in the possibility of further reductions in margins 
in addition  prior to the winter heating season  the heating oil segment attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service and  as part of that effort  centralized its heating equipment service dispatch and engaged a centralized call center to respond to telephone inquiries 
the implementation of that initiative has taken longer than the heating oil segment anticipated  impacting customer service 
the partnership believes that the heating oil segment s rate of customer loss in fiscal was due to a combination of higher energy prices  operational and customer service problems together with the implementation of stricter customer credit requirements towards the end of fiscal for fiscal  retail volume sold at the propane segment increased million gallons  or  to millions gallons  as compared to million gallons for fiscal this increase in volume reflects the additional million gallons provided by acquisitions  partially offset by the impact of warmer temperatures and customer attrition 
temperatures in the propane segment s geographic areas of operations were warmer in fiscal than in fiscal and warmer than normal as reported by noaa 
at september   after adjusting for acquisitions  the propane oil segment estimates that it had approximately fewer customers than at september  the propane segment believes that the increase in the price of propane was the primary reason for the net attrition in fiscal the partnership believes that greater than normal price competition resulting from many of the propane segment s competitors  including farmers cooperatives in the midwest  appear to have succeeded in inducing the propane segment s customers to leave through various price related strategies 

table of contents product sales for fiscal  product sales increased million  or  to  million  as compared to  million for fiscal at the heating oil segment  product sales declined by million  or  to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal while warmer temperatures and customer losses at the heating oil segment led to a reduction in product sales  the decline was partially offset by an increase in product sales attributable to acquisitions and higher selling prices 
at the propane segment  product sales increased by million  or  to million  as compared to million in fiscal largely due to higher retail volume sold 
this increase at the propane segment was primarily due to the additional sales from acquisitions and higher selling prices  which offset the impact of warmer weather and customer attrition 
as experienced in the heating oil segment  selling prices at the propane segment were higher in fiscal than in fiscal in response to higher wholesale propane supply costs 
sales  installation  service and appliances for fiscal  installation  service and appliance sales increased million  or  to million as compared to million for fiscal at the heating oil segment  installation  service and appliance sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal due to acquisitions and measures taken in the last several years to increase service revenues 
in the propane segment  installation  service and appliance sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal largely due to acquisitions 
this large increase in the propane segment was greater than in prior years due to the acquisition of home energy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which accounted for million of the increase in installation  service and appliance sales 
cost of product for fiscal  cost of product increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal in the heating oil segment  cost of product declined by million  or  to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  as the impact of net customer attrition and warmer temperatures exceeded wholesale cost increases and the additional product requirement for acquisitions 
in the propane segment  cost of product increased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to acquisitions and an increase in wholesale supply costs  which more than offset a reduction in cost of product due to warmer temperatures and net customer attrition 
while selling prices and wholesale prices increased on a per gallon basis at both segments  the increase in selling prices exceeded the increase in supply costs during the first nine months of fiscal at september   heating oil supply costs were approximately higher than at june  and propane supply costs were approximately higher for the same period 
during the three months ended september   the segments were not able to fully pass these increases on to their respective customers 
as a result  per gallon margins for the three months ended september  declined by cents per gallon at the heating oil segment and cents per gallon at the propane segment  as compared to the three months ended september   which partially offset per gallon margin increases that the segments experienced earlier in the year 
the per gallon margins realized in both segments for the three months ended september  were significantly less than expectations 
for fiscal  per gallon margin increases were realized in the base business compared to fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions of cents per gallon at the heating oil segment and cents per gallon at the propane segment 
overall per gallon margins at the propane segment declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the mix of volume attributable to acquisitions 
the partnership continues to experience high wholesale supply costs and believes that it will not be able to pass all these increases on to its customers through retail sales prices 
if wholesale supply costs remain volatile and at historically high levels  per gallon profit margins and results are likely to be adversely impacted 
see recent performance below 
cost of installations  service and appliances for fiscal  costs of installations  service and appliances increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal representing a reduction in the loss historically associated with installations  service and appliances 
at the heating oil segment  cost of installations  service and appliances increased million  or  to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal this change was primarily due to acquisitions and wage and other cost increases 
in the propane segment  cost of installations  service and appliances increased million  or  to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal due to the previously noted acquisition of home energy in the fourth fiscal quarter of whose full year impact is first reflected in fiscal 
table of contents delivery and branch expenses for fiscal  delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal at the heating oil segment  delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal this increase in the heating oil segment of million was due to a higher level of fixed and variable operating costs attributable to acquisitions  primarily those completed in eastern pennsylvania of million and approximately million due to operating and wage increases 
these increases in delivery and branch expenses were partially reduced by cost reductions relating to lower volume delivered due to warmer temperatures and net customer attrition experienced in fiscal prior to the winter heating season  the heating oil segment attempted to develop a competitive advantage in customer service  and as part of that effort centralized its heating equipment service dispatch and engaged a centralized call center to respond to telephone inquiries 
start up challenges associated with this initiative impacted the customer base and unanticipated training and support was required 
the expected savings from this initiative were less than expected 
at the propane segment  delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million as compared to million for fiscal this increase of million was due to additional operating costs associated with acquisitions at the propane segment of million of which million is attributable to the home energy acquisition  and approximately million due to operating and wage increases 
as in the heating oil segment  the delivery and branch expense increases at the propane segment was partially offset by cost reductions relating to lower volume attributable to warmer weather and net customer losses 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to a larger depreciable base of assets  as a result of the impact of recent acquisitions at both the heating oil and propane segments and to increased depreciation resulting from the technology investment made by the heating oil segment in centralizing its customer service and dispatcher functions 
increases of million and million were experienced at the heating oil and propane segments  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal  general and administrative expenses declined million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal at the partnership level  general and administrative expenses declined by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to a million reduction in the expense for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights on the partnership s senior subordinated units  a million reduction in restricted stock awards and a reduction of million in bonus compensation expense 
for fiscal  partnership level expenses totaled million which included million in salary expense and bonus  million in legal and administrative costs  partially offset by a credit of million for unit appreciation rights 
for fiscal  partnership expenses totaled million which included million in salary and bonus expense  million in unit appreciation rights and restricted stock awards expense and million in legal and administrative costs 
at the heating oil segment  general and administrative expenses declined by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decline was due to a reduction in certain expenses relating to the heating oil segment s centralized customer service and dispatch project of million 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses at the heating oil segment was partially offset by million in additional expenses due to severances paid and a higher level of legal and professional expenses 
at the propane segment  general and administrative expenses declined million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal operating income loss for fiscal  operating income decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal at the partnership level  the operating loss decreased by million from a million loss in fiscal to a million loss in fiscal due to a million reduction in the accrual for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights on partnership s senior subordinated units  lower restricted stock awards of million and lower bonus compensation expense of million 
at the heating oil segment  operating income declined by million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this decline was due to warmer temperatures of in the heating oil segment s geographic areas of operations in fiscal than in fiscal  net customer attrition  operating and wage increases and higher depreciation and amortization expense  which were reduced in part by the operating income attributable to acquisitions  an increase in per gallon gross profit margins of the base business  lower expenses associated with the heating oil segment s centralized customer service and dispatch project and increased service revenues 
at the propane segment  operating income declined million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this decline was due to warmer temperatures of in the propane segment s geographic areas of operations in fiscal compared to fiscal  net customer attrition  operating and wage increases and higher depreciation and amortization  reduced in part by operating income from acquisitions and higher per gallon margins 

table of contents interest expense for fiscal  interest expense increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to higher principal amount of long term debt outstanding and an increase in the partnership s weighted average interest rate during fiscal  as compared to fiscal amortization of debt issuance costs for fiscal  amortization of debt issuance costs increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was largely due to the amortization of debt issuance costs for the partnership s million senior notes offerings and for the amortization of bank fees incurred in connection with refinancing certain bank facilities 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal was million and represents certain state income taxes 
the amount recorded in fiscal was unchanged from fiscal income loss from continuing operations for fiscal  income loss from continuing operations decreased million  to a loss of million  as compared to income of million for fiscal this decline was due to a million decrease in income at the heating oil segment and a decline in income at the propane segment of million partially offset by million in lower losses at the partnership level 
income loss from continuing operations declined as the effects of warmer temperatures  other volume changes  including customer losses  operating and wage increases and an increase in interest expense were partially offset by the positive impacts of acquisitions  improved per gallon gross profit margins on the base business and lower compensation expenses at the partnership level of million in the form of unit appreciation rights  restricted stock awards and bonus expense

the remaining increase in delivery and branch expenses of million  for fiscal  was largely due to the additional operating cost associated with increased volumes delivered  higher marketing costs at the heating oil segment of million  higher bad debt expense of million at the heating oil segment  higher bad debt expense of million at the propane segment and to the impact of operating expense and wage increases 
depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  approximately million of goodwill amortization was included in depreciation and amortization expense 
as of october   goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance to sfas no 
depreciation and amortization expense related to acquisitions and fixed asset additions acquired after september   resulted in increases which partially offset the decrease attributable to goodwill amortization 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was largely due to the inclusion of million of incremental expense related to the business process redesign project in the heating oil segment  a million increase in the accrual for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights and restricted stock awards previously granted and for other increases of million  largely due to increased bonus compensation based upon results for fiscal million  higher legal and professional expenses at the partnership level million and for increased expenses at the propane segment million for its increased size 
the increase in legal and professional expenses at the partnership level were largely attributable to achieving and maintaining compliance with sec rules and regulations  acquisitions and financing related issues 

table of contents the heating oil segment undertook to consolidate certain heating oil operational activities in an attempt to create operating efficiencies and cost savings with service technicians being dispatched from two consolidated locations rather than local offices and oil delivery being managed from regional locations rather than local offices 
a transition to outsourcing in the area of customer relationship management was undertaken as both a customer satisfaction and a cost reduction strategy 
the partnership believed outsourcing customer inquiries would improve performance and leverage technology to eliminate system redundancy available from third party service organizations 
in addition  an outsourcing partner has greater flexibility to manage extreme seasonal volume 
the complexity of customer interactions combined with the partnership s goal for service excellence led to protracted training efforts 
the heating oil segment began introducing call based technology enhancements including capabilities for customer inquiries via automated interactive telephone response and the web 
the million incremental expense in fiscal million of actual fiscal expense related to this redesign project largely consisted of consulting fees  employee termination benefits and separation cost and travel related expenditures 
in connection with this project  the partnership reduced the size of its work force and recognized a liability of approximately million related to certain employee termination benefits and separation costs 
interest expense for fiscal  interest expense increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was largely due to additional interest expense of million for higher average outstanding working capital borrowings and due to additional interest related to the higher interest rate on the partnership s million debt offering partially offset by interest expense related to the debt repaid with the offering 
income tax expense for fiscal  income tax expense increased million to million  as compared to a tax benefit of million for fiscal this increase was due to higher state income taxes based upon the higher pretax earnings achieved for fiscal and the absence in fiscal of the tax benefit from a federal tax loss carryback of million recorded in fiscal income from continuing operations for fiscal  net income from continuing operations increased million  to million  as compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to a million increase in net income at the heating oil segment  a million increase in the propane segment offset by a million increase in the net loss at the partnership level 
this increase was primarily due to the impact of colder weather on continuing operations and lower depreciation and amortization for continuing operations 
income loss from discontinued operations for fiscal  the income from discontinued operations increased million from a loss of million in fiscal to income of million in fiscal tg e was sold on march  for fiscal  the partnership recorded a million decrease in net income arising from the adoption of sfas no 
to reflect the impairment of its goodwill for its tg e segment which is reflected herein as discontinued operations 
net income loss for fiscal  net income increased million or to million  as compared to a loss of million in fiscal this increase was due to the increase in net income from continuing operations of million  the additional net income provided from discontinued operations of million partially offset by the million decrease in net income at the discontinued tg e segment from the adoption of sfas no 

table of contents recent performance the following is a discussion of certain important factors that have had a significant impact on the partnership s recent performance 
volume for the three months ended september   retail volume of home heating oil and propane decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for the three months ended september  retail volume sold in the heating segment declined by million gallons  or  to million gallons for the three months ended september   as compared to million gallons for the three months ended september  the partnership believes that this decline was due to the impact of customer attrition throughout fiscal based on the preliminary data available to it  the partnership believes that for the period from october  to november   retail volume sold in the heating oil segment declined by million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons in the prior year s comparable period 
this was primarily due to the carryover impact of the customer attrition from fiscal temperatures in the heating oil segment s geographic areas of operations for the period october  to november  were approximately similar to the prior year s comparable period 
for the three months ended september   the heating oil segment lost  accounts net or approximately of its customer base  as compared to the three months ended september  in which the heating oil segment lost  accounts net or approximately of its customer base 
the partnership believes that net customer losses are a result of various factors including but not limited to price  service and credit 
the continuous rise in the price of heating oil especially during the fourth quarter of fiscal added to the heating oil segment s difficulties in reducing customer attrition 
as of september   the cost of home heating oil  as measured by the closing price of the new york mercantile exchange  had increased by to from on june  based on the preliminary data available to it  the partnership believes that for the period from october  to november   the heating oil segment lost approximately  accounts net  versus the two months ending november  in which the heating oil segment s net customer loss was approximately accounts net 
while the heating oil segment believes its customer service has improved in october and november versus the comparable two months in the previous year  at this time  the heating oil segment cannot estimate the net customer attrition rate for fiscal however  even if the net customer attrition rate is reduced  the lower customer base resulting from the fiscal customer attrition will continue to adversely affect the partnership during fiscal and perhaps beyond 
retail volume sold in the propane segment increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons for the three months ended september   as compared to million gallons for the three months ended september  the partnership believes that this million gallon increase was due to the additional volume provided from acquisitions  partially offset by the carryover effect of customer attrition in fiscal for the period from october  to november   retail volume sold at the propane segment declined by million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons in the prior year s comparable period 
the decline was due to the carryover effect of customer attrition from fiscal and lower agriculture volume  partially offset by the impact of acquisitions 
temperatures for the propane segment s geographic areas of operations were approximately similar in both periods 
for the three months ended september   the propane segment lost  accounts net or approximately of its customer base  as compared to the three months ended september  in which the propane segment lost  accounts net or approximately of its customer base 
based on the preliminary data available to us  the partnership believes that for the period from october  to november   the propane segment gained approximately  accounts net as compared to the prior year s comparable period in which the propane segment lost approximately accounts net 
at this time  the propane segment cannot estimate the net customer attrition rate for fiscal  however  even if the net customer attrition rate is reduced  the lower customer base resulting from the fiscal customer attrition will continue to adversely effect the partnership through the date of the proposed sale of the propane segment and  if the propane segment is not sold  through the remainder of fiscal and perhaps beyond 

table of contents cost of product as of september   the wholesale cost of home heating oil  as measured by the closing price of the new york mercantile exchange had increased by to from on june  per gallon heating oil prices subsequently increased to a high of per gallon on october   before retreating to per gallon as of december  as of september   the wholesale cost of propane  as reported by oil price information service had increased to per gallon from per gallon on june  the per gallon price of propane subsequently increased to a high of on october  before retreating to per gallon as of december  during the three months ended september   the segments were not able to fully pass these increases on to their respective customers resulting in a decline in per gallon margins in the base business  excluding the impact of acquisitions for the three months ended september  as compared to the three months ended september  of approximately cents at the heating oil segment and cents at the propane segment 
the per gallon margins realized at both segments were significantly less than expectations 
the partnership continues to experience high wholesale supply costs and believes that it will not be able to pass all these increases on to its customers through retail sales prices 
if wholesale supply costs remain at volatile and historically high levels  per gallon profit margins and results are likely to be adversely impacted 
the continuous rise and the volatility in the price of heating oil have adversely impacted the heating oil segment s per gallon gross profit margins 
preliminary indications are that the per gallon margins for the period from october  to november  will be lower than the comparable period for fiscal at the propane segment  preliminary indications are that the per gallon gross profit margins for the period from october  to november  will be lower than the prior year s comparable period 
operating expenses late in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the heating oil segment launched a new marketing campaign and its success has yet to be determined 
for the period from october  to november   based upon the preliminary information available to it  the heating oil segment anticipates that operating expenses will increase by million  as compared to the prior year s two month period  due to wage and cost increases  additional expenses associated with the outsourced call center and higher marketing costs of million 
at the propane segment  the partnership believes that operating expenses will also increase by million 
in addition  the partnership anticipates additional fees and expenses at the heating oil segment and at the partnership level attributable to the refinancings described below 
sale of propane and refinancing costs and expenses the partnership has signed an agreement to sell its propane distribution and services business  held through the propane segment to inergy for million  subject to certain adjustments 
in addition  the partnership has given notice to holders of the secured notes of the heating oil segment of its optional election to prepay the secured notes  representing an aggregate payment  including principal  interest and estimated premium  of approximately million 
the partnership has also given notice to the holders of the secured notes of its propane segment of its optional election to prepay the secured notes representing an aggregate payment including principal  interest and estimated premium  of approximately million 
the aggregate amount payable with regard to both sets of secured notes is approximately million 
as discussed elsewhere herein  these payments are expected to be made from either the proceeds of the sale of the propane segment or the jp morgan chase bridge facility 
the partnership is taking steps to put in place  on or before december   a new asset based loan facility to refinance the working capital indebtedness of the heating oil segment as well as a bridge facility to provide funds to repay the heating oil segment s and propane segment s institutional indebtedness if the sale of the propane segment is not completed by such date 
in connection with the sale of the propane segment  the refinancing of the heating oil segment s working capital facility and certain covenant modifications required of the heating oil segment s current bank facilities  the partnership estimates fees and expenses associated with these transactions will range from million to million 
if these transactions are completed  the partnership estimates that between million and million of fees and expenses will be charged to income during the first quarter of fiscal and between million and million will be capitalized as a deferred charge 
the partnership also expects to record a loss on the early extinguishment of long term debt of approximately million  which includes pre payment premiums paid of million and the write off of approximately million of previously capitalized deferred financing costs 
it is estimated that the partnership will record a gain on the sale of the propane segment in excess of approximately million and is subject to adjustment 
through december   the partnership had paid million in fees and expenses relating to the above transactions  which are included in the above estimates 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the ability of the partnership to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions  the ability to pass on the full impact of record heating oil prices to customers  the effects of higher customer attrition and other factors  most of which are beyond its control 
future capital requirements of the partnership are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand at september  to the extent future capital requirements exceed cash flows from operating activities  the partnership anticipates that a working capital will be financed by the partnership s new revolving credit facility as discussed below and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable  and b maintenance and growth capital expenditures  mainly for customer tanks  will be financed in fiscal by the use of the new revolving credit facility 
see financing and sources of liquidity following refinancing transactions below 
operating activities the net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal consisted of losses from continuing operations of million  non cash charges of million and million provided from a decline in operating assets and liabilities 
for fiscal  net cash provided by the change in operating assets and liabilities was million 
in fiscal  the change in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash amounting to million 
this change of million is largely due to the cash required to finance accounts receivable 
in fiscal  sales increased by million  or  to  million  which resulted in an increase in accounts receivable of million or of the increase in sales 
in contrast to the change from fiscal to  sales for fiscal increased million  or  to  million  as compared to and resulted in an increase in accounts receivable of million or of the increase in sales 
investing activities during fiscal  the partnership completed acquisitions  investing million  and spent million for capital expenditures comprised of million incurred to sustain operations at current levels and million to support growth of operations 
investing activities also includes million from the sale of tg e and million from the sale of excess fixed assets 
as a result  cash flows used in investing activities were million 
during fiscal  the partnership completed ten acquisitions  investing million 
this expenditure for acquisitions is included in the cash used in investing activities of million along with the million invested for capital expenditures 
the million for capital expenditures is comprised of million of capital additions needed to sustain operations at current levels and million for capital expenditures incurred in connection with the heating oil segment s business process redesign program and for customer tanks and other capital expenditures to support growth of operations 
investing activities also includes proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of million 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were million for fiscal during this period  million of cash was provided from the issuance of million in mlp notes and the issuance of million in common units 
also during this period million of cash was used to pay unit distributions of million  million went to repay the acquisition facility and other long term debt  million was used to repay working capital borrowings  and million in deferred charges were paid  primarily million relating to the renewal of the heating oil segment s bank credit facilities and debt related financing costs 
as a result of the above activity and million of cash provided by discontinued operations  cash increased by million to million as of september  
table of contents financing and sources of liquidity following refinancing transactions in accordance with the jp morgan chase bank commitment letter  the heating oil segment and propane segment intend to enter into a million revolving credit facility agreement with a group of lenders led by jp morgan chase bank  as administrative agent on or before december  upon the sale of the propane segment  the revolving credit facility would be reduced to million 
at the same time  the heating oil segment and propane segment intend to enter into a million bridge facility agreement 
the revolving credit facility agreement is intended to close on december   subject to compliance with customary closing conditions 
if the sale of the propane segment closes on or before december   the partnership would not draw down on the bridge facility 
otherwise  the partnership would expect to close the bridge facility agreement at the same time as the closing of the revolving credit agreement 
the proceeds of the revolving credit facility and  as applicable  the bridge facility or the sale of the propane segment  will be used to refinance the heating oil segment and propane segment s existing working capital facilities  to refinance all of the outstanding institutional indebtedness of the heating oil segment and the propane segment  including any premiums that are payable thereunder and to pay various transaction expenses 
the revolving credit facility will provide the heating oil segment and propane segment with the ability to borrow up to million for working capital purposes subject to certain borrowing base limitations  including the issuance of up to million in letters of credit 
obligations under the revolving credit facility will be secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the heating oil segment and the propane segment  accounts receivable  inventory  general intangibles  real property  fixtures and equipment 
if the propane segment is sold either before or after december   the revolving credit facility will be reduced to million subject to borrowing base limitations and the liens on all of the assets of the propane segment would be released 
obligations under the revolving credit facility will be guaranteed by the propane segment and heating oil segment subsidiaries and by the partnership 
if the sale of the propane segment does not close until after the partnership has drawn down on the bridge facility  the partnership will use a portion of the sales proceeds to repay the bridge loan 
thereafter  pursuant to the terms of the indenture relating to the partnership s mlp notes  the partnership will be obligated  within days of the sale  to apply the net proceeds of the sale of the propane segment either to reduce indebtedness of the partnership or of a restricted subsidiary  or to make an investment in assets or capital expenditures useful to the partnership s or any subsidiary s business 
to the extent any net proceeds that are not so applied exceed million excess proceeds  the indenture requires the partnership to make an offer to all holders of mlp notes to purchase for cash that number of mlp notes that may be purchased with excess proceeds at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the mlp notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
the partnership cannot determine the amount of excess proceeds that will result from the sale of the propane segment 
accordingly  the partnership cannot predict the size of any offer to purchase mlp notes and whether or to what extent holders of mlp notes will accept the offer to purchase when made 
if the agreement for the sale of the propane segment is terminated  the partnership will seek to repay the bridge facility through the issuance of senior secured notes issued by the heating oil segment and propane segment in a public or private offering 
following consummation of the refinancing transactions  the partnership s primary source of liquidity will be internally generated cash the remaining proceeds from the sale of the propane segment  if such segment is sold  and the revolving credit facility 
at september   the partnership would have had million of cash and cash equivalents available to fund its operations on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the refinancing transactions  sale of the propane segment and before the application of excess proceeds to purchase mlp notes 
total bank borrowing would be reduced from million to zero 
if the propane segment is not sold  the partnership would have had million of cash and cash equivalents available to fund its operations on a pro forma basis as of september  after giving effect to the refinancing transactions 
total bank borrowing would increase from million to million and the partnership s total availability under its new revolving credit facility would have been million after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit and expected borrowing base limitations 
after giving effect to the refinancing transactions and sale of the propane segment  and before the application of excess proceeds to purchase mlp notes  the partnership s total long term debt would have been approximately million as of september  compared to million on an actual basis 
if the partnership does not sell the propane segment  its total long term debt on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the refinancing transactions would have been million as of such date 

table of contents the following summarizes the long term debt maturities that the partnership would have had as of september   on a pro forma basis  in the first case after giving effect to the refinancing transactions and sale of the propane segment and in the second case if the propane segment is not sold in millions refinancing transactions and sale of propane segment thereafter refinancing transactions without sale of propane segment thereafter the partnership expects that its significant liquidity requirements after the refinancing transaction will consist of payments on mlp notes and the bridge facility or senior secured notes if the propane segment is not sold and working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the revolving credit facility and  as applicable  the bridge facility or the senior secured notes  will impose certain restrictions on the partnership  including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness  to pay distributions  make investments  grant liens  sell its assets and engage in certain other activities 
the revolving credit facility and  as applicable  the bridge facility or the senior secured notes  will also require the partnership to maintain certain financial ratios  and will contain borrowing conditions and customary events of default  including nonpayment of principal or interest  violation of covenants  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  cross defaults to other indebtedness  bankruptcy and other insolvency events 
the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration under the revolving credit facility and  as applicable  the bridge facility or the senior secured notes  would result in its inability to obtain further borrowings under that facility  which could adversely affect its liquidity 
an acceleration under the revolving credit facility and  as applicable  the bridge facility or the senior secured notes  would result in a default under the mlp notes and  as applicable  the partnership s other funded debt 
based on the partnership s current level of operations  the partnership believes that its existing financial resources together with its current and anticipated cash from operations  the revolving credit facility and the proceeds of the sale of the propane segment or the bridge facility or senior secured notes  if the propane segment is not sold  should be adequate for the foreseeable future to make required payments of principal and interest on its debt and fund its working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
the partnership cannot assure you  however  that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable the partnership to service its debt  including the mlp notes and  as applicable  the bridge facility or the senior secured notes  and to fund its other liquidity needs 
if the partnership is unable to close the revolving credit facility and either the bridge facility or the sale of the propane segment by december   the partnership would not be able to find other sources of financing before december  to refinance the heating oil segment s and propane segment s credit facilities and to repay the heating oil segment s and propane segment s institutional indebtedness  which are due and payable on such date 
in such event  if the partnership is not successful in rescheduling the maturity dates of such indebtedness  the partnership may be forced to seek the protection of the bankruptcy courts 
to the extent the partnership makes acquisitions  or otherwise expand its operations in the future  it may require new sources of funding  including additional debt which could further increase its leverage 
the partnership cannot assure you that it will be able to raise any necessary funds in addition to those currently available to the partnership through bank financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities on terms acceptable to the partnership  if at all 
the revolving credit facility and  as applicable  the bridge facility or the senior secured notes  will impose certain restrictions on the partnership s ability to pay distributions to unitholders 
the partnership believes that the sale of the propane segment would  by de leveraging the partnership s balance sheet  likely advance the time when it would be possible for the partnership to resume regular distributions on the common units 
the partnership believes that whether or not the propane segment is sold  it is unlikely that the partnership will resume regular distributions on the senior subordinated units  junior subordinated units and general partner units for the foreseeable future 

table of contents historical financing and sources of liquidity at september   the partnership s heating oil segment had a bank credit facility consisting of three facilities totaling million having a maturity date of june  these facilities consisted of a million revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which are to be used for working capital purposes  a million revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which were to be used for the issuance of standby letters of credit in connection with surety  worker s compensation and other financial guarantees  and a million revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which were to be used to finance or refinance certain acquisitions and capital expenditures  for the issuance of letters of credit in connection with acquisitions and  to the extent that there is insufficient availability under the working capital facility 
at september   million of working capital borrowings and million of the insurance letters of credit were outstanding 
at september   the partnership s propane segment had a bank credit facility  which consisted of a million acquisition facility  a million parity debt facility that could be used to fund maintenance and growth capital expenditures and a million working capital facility 
the working capital facility expired on september  borrowings under the acquisition and parity debt facilities revolved until september   after which time any outstanding loans thereunder  would amortize in quarterly principal payments with a final payment due on september  at september   million of parity debt facility borrowings were outstanding 
the partnership s bank credit facilities and debt agreements contain several financial tests and covenants restricting the various segments and partnership s ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general these tests are based upon achieving certain debt to cash flow ratios and cash flow to interest expense ratios 
in addition  the heating oil segment s working capital facility requires the heating oil segment to maintain a zero balance for at least forty five consecutive days 
the propane segment s working capital facility has a similar requirement which is thirty consecutive days 
failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of the partnership s various bank and note facility agreements could negatively impact the partnership s ability to incur additional debt and or pay distributions and could cause certain debt to become currently payable 
as of september   the partnership was in compliance with all debt covenants  except for the required ratio of consolidated cash flow to consolidated interest expense as defined in the heating oil segment s bank facilities 
the heating oil segment obtained a waiver of this covenant on november  through december  on october   the heating oil segment advised its bank lenders that it would not be able to make the required representations included in the borrowing certificate under its working capital line 
in addition  the heating oil segment notified its lenders that  for the quarter ending december  and for the foreseeable future thereafter  the heating oil segment will be unlikely to satisfy the drawing condition that requires that the consolidated funded debt of the partnership not exceed times its consolidated operating cash flow 
further  the heating oil segment advised the lenders that the heating oil segment may not be able to maintain a zero balance under the working capital facility except for letter of credit obligations for consecutive days from april  to september   as required by the heating oil segment s covenants 
see recent events 
on november   the heating oil segment entered into a letter amendment and waiver under its heating oil segment credit agreement 
as a result of the amendment  the heating oil segment expects to be able to continue to borrow funds under the credit agreement to support its working capital requirements for the near term 
the amendment provides for the waiver  through december   of various terms under the credit agreement 
the amendment also amends for the waiver period the financial covenant regarding the partnership s consolidated funded debt to cash flow ratio and the financial covenant regarding the heating oil segment cash flow to interest expense ratio 
the partnership is relying upon the closing of the revolving credit facility to provide funds to repay the amounts outstanding under the heating oil segment and propane segment s current bank facilities and to provide an ongoing source of working capital 
on january   the partnership and star gas finance company jointly issued million face value senior notes due on february  these notes accrue interest at an annual rate of and require semi annual interest payments on february and august of each year commencing on february  these notes are redeemable at the option of the partnership  in whole or in part  from time to time by payment of a premium as defined

the following summarizes the partnership s long term debt maturities during fiscal years ending september  exclusive of amounts that have been repaid through september  in millions a thereafter a on november   the partnership gave notice to holders of the heating oil segment s secured notes of its optional election to prepay such secured notes and gave notice of its optional election to prepay its propane segment s secured notes 
as a result  the amount due in fiscal increases by million to million 
the partnership s heating oil segment s bank facilities allow for the refinancing of up to million of existing senior debt and the partnership s propane segment s bank facilities allow for the refinancing of up to million of existing senior debt 
the refinancing capabilities are subject to capacity and other restrictions 
the partnership is dependent upon the closing of the bridge facility and or the sale of the propane segment to fund the repayment of this indebtedness 
in general  the partnership distributes to its partners on a quarterly basis  all of its available cash in the manner described in note quarterly distribution of available cash of the consolidated financial statements 
available cash is defined for any of the partnership s fiscal quarters  as all cash on hand at the end of that quarter  less the amount of cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of the general partner to i provide for the proper conduct of the business  ii comply with applicable law  any of its debt instruments or other agreements  or iii provide funds for distributions to the common unitholders and the senior subordinated unitholders during the next four quarters  in some circumstances 
on october   the partnership announced that it would not pay a distribution on the common units as a result of the requirements of its lenders 
the partnership had previously announced the suspension of distributions on the senior subordinated units on july  and it is unlikely that regular distributions on the senior subordinated units will be resumed in the foreseeable future 
for more information on the relative rights and preferences of the senior subordinated units  see the partnership s partnership agreement which is incorporated by reference in this annual report as described in item the partnership believes that the purchase of weather insurance could be an important element in the partnership s ability to maintain the stability of its cash flows 
the partnership purchased weather insurance that could have provided up to million of coverage for the impact of warm weather on the heating oil segment s operating results for the and heating seasons 
no amounts were received under the policies during fiscal and due to colder than normal temperatures 
in addition  the partnership purchased a base of million of weather insurance coverage for each year from and purchased an additional million of weather insurance coverage for fiscal the amount of insurance proceeds that could be realized under these policies is calculated by multiplying a fixed dollar amount by the degree day deviation from an agreed upon cumulative degree day strike price

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
star gas evaluates its policies and estimates on an on going basis 
the partnership s consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
the partnership s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the partnership s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
star gas believes the following are its critical accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets the partnership calculates amortization using the straight line method over periods ranging from to years for intangible assets with definite useful lives 
star gas uses amortization methods and determines asset values based on its best estimates using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
star gas assesses the useful lives of intangible assets based on the estimated period over which star gas will receive benefit from such intangible assets such as historical evidence regarding customer churn rate 
in some cases  the estimated useful lives are based on contractual terms 
at september   the partnership had million of net intangible assets subject to amortization 
if circumstances required a change in estimated useful lives of the assets  it could have a material effect on results of operations 
for example  if lives were shortened by one year  the partnership estimates that amortization for these assets for fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
sfas no 
requires the partnership s goodwill to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
these assessments involve management s estimates of future cash flows  market trends and other factors to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  which includes the goodwill to be assessed 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value and is determined to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded 
at september   the partnership had million of goodwill 
intangible assets with finite lives must be assessed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
similar to goodwill  the assessment for impairment requires estimates of future cash flows related to the intangible asset 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds it future cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded based on the fair value of the asset 
the partnership tests the carrying amount of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
the partnership has determined that there is no impairment of goodwill at either the heating oil segment or propane segment as of september  and depreciation of property  plant and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from to years 
net property  plant and equipment was million for the partnership at september  if circumstances required a change in estimated useful lives of the assets  it could have a material effect on results of operations 
for example  if lives were shortened by one year  the partnership estimates that depreciation for fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
assumptions used in the measurement of the partnership s defined benefit obligations sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions as amended by sfas no 
employers disclosure about pensions and other postretirement benefits requires the partnership to make assumptions as to the expected long term rate of return that could be achieved on defined benefit plan assets and discount rates to determine the present value of the plans pension obligations 
the partnership evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate enables the partnership to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the rate is required to represent the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rated used for fiscal would have increased pension expense by approximately million and would have increased the minimum pension liability by another million 
the partnership assumed a discount rate of as of september  the partnership considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets to determine its expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the partnership s qualified actuaries 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscals and was and respectively 
as of september   this assumption was reduced to for determining net periodic pension expense 
a further basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would have increased pension expense in fiscal by approximately million 
over the life of the plans  both gains and losses have been recognized by the plans in the calculation of annual pension expense 
as of september   million of unrecognized losses remain to be recognized by the plans 
these losses may result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the partnership periodically reviews past due customer accounts receivable balances 
after giving consideration to economic conditions  overdue status and other factors  the partnership establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts at each of its segments which it deems sufficient to cover future potential losses 
as a result  actual losses could differ from management s estimates  however  based on historical experience  the partnership does not expect its estimate of uncollectible accounts to vary significantly from actual losses 
insurance reserves the partnership s heating oil segment has in the past and is currently self insuring a portion of workers compensation  auto and general liability claims 
in february  the propane segment also began self insuring a portion of its workers compensation claims 
the partnership establishes reserves based upon expectations as to what its ultimate liability may be for these claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience 
the partnership continually evaluates the potential for changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries 
as of september   the heating oil segment had approximately million of insurance reserves and the propane segment had million of insurance reserves 
the ultimate settlement of these claims could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its bank credit facilities 
the partnership utilizes these borrowings to meet its working capital needs and also to fund the short term needs of its acquisition program 
at september   the partnership had outstanding borrowings totaling million  of which approximately million is subject to variable interest rates under its bank credit facilities 
in the event that interest rates associated with these facilities were to increase basis points  the impact on future cash flows would be a decrease of approximately million annually 
the partnership also selectively uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risk related to changes in the current and future market price of home heating oil and propane 
the value of market sensitive derivative instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market prices 
consistent with the nature of hedging activity  associated unrealized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the purchase price the partnership would pay for the home heating oil  propane or natural gas being hedged 
sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes 
based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of product at september   the potential impact on the partnership s hedging activity would be to increase the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value of million  and conversely a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of product would decrease the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value of million
