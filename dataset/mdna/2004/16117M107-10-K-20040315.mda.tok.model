our working capital deficit was million at december  for the year ended december   our revenues  net loss applicable to common stock and loss per common share were approximately billion  million and  respectively 
we have a history of net losses 
further  we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover our interest costs we incur because of our high level of debt  the depreciation expenses that we incur resulting from the capital investments we have made in our cable properties  and the amortization and impairment of our franchise intangibles 
we expect that these expenses other than amortization and impairment of franchises will remain significant  and we therefore expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
additionally  reported losses allocated to minority interest on the statement of operations will be limited to the extent of any remaining minority interest on the balance sheet related to charter communications holding company  llc charter holdco

restatement of prior results there were no restatements in of prior results 
however  certain reclassifications have been made to and amounts to conform to presentation 
also  as discussed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   as part of a re audit performed by kpmg llp  we concluded that it was appropriate to make certain adjustments to previously reported results 
in the restatement of our results  adjustments were made  among other things  to previous interpretations and applications of generally accepted accounting principles that had been consistently followed by us since and throughout the restatement period 
these adjustments reduced revenues reported in our quarterly reports on form q for the first three quarters of by a total of million  and in our annual report on form k for the years ended december  and by million and million  respectively 
such adjustments represent approximately  and of previously reported revenues for the respective periods in  and our previously reported consolidated net loss increased by a total of million for the first three quarters of and decreased by million for the year ended december  our previously reported net loss increased by million for the year ended december   primarily due to adjustments related to the original accounting for acquisitions and elements of our rebuild and upgrade activities

certain significant developments in and early in  we substantially completed the upgrade of our cable systems that we had commenced in our systems upgrade increased our bandwidth capacity  enabling us to offer digital video service  two way communication capability and other advanced services 
in addition  our upgrade has enabled us to reduce the number of headend control centers  or headends  which house the equipment to receive broadcast and satellite signals  transmit signals to customers and connect customers for data services 
in  we invested approximately million to upgrade our systems 
at december   approximately of our customers were served by bandwidth of megahertz or greater  approximately are served by bandwidth of megahertz or greater and approximately of our plant was two way enabled 
see our network technology 
during  we undertook a number of transition activities including reorganizing our workforce  adjusting our video pricing and packages  completing call center consolidations and implementing billing conversions 
due to the focus on such activities and certain financial constraints  we reduced spending on marketing our products and services 
we believe that the reduction in marketing activities and other necessary operational changes negatively impacted customer retention and acquisition  primarily during the first half of the year 
during the second half of  we increased our marketing efforts and implemented promotional campaigns to slow the loss of analog video customers  and to accelerate advanced services penetration  specifically in high speed data 
in  we had a net decline in analog video customers from approximately million to approximately million 
during the same period  our number of high speed data customers increased by approximately  contributing to a revenue increase of approximately in see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the ebu method of estimating analog video customers is consistent with the methodology used in determining costs paid to programmers and has been consistently applied year over year

in  we expect to increase availability in strategic competitive markets and we are working on making our i tv channels local content oriented 
although we do not charge our customers for this service  we believe our ability to enhance our interactive content with local information such as local movie times  local sports and local weather provides us with an important advantage over satellite competition 
commercial services 
we offer integrated network solutions to commercial and institutional customers 
these solutions include high speed data and video services 
in addition  we offer high speed data services to local businesses 
digital video recorder in december  we launched digital video recording capabilities service in four los angeles systems serving  digital video customers at year end 
we expect to further expand dvr deployment in and we expect to end with dvr deployment in systems serving approximately million digital video customers  which would be approximately of our digital video customers as of december  sale of advertising we receive revenue from the sale of local advertising on satellite delivered networks such as mtv  cnn and espn 
in any particular market  we generally insert local advertising on a minimum of four networks  and have covered up to channels 
our system rebuild and digital service launches have increased the number of available channels on which we are able to insert local advertising 
we also provide cross channel advertising to some programmers 
from time to time  certain of our equipment vendors have purchased advertising from us 
for the years ending december   and  advertising revenues from equipment vendors was recognized in the amounts of  million  and million  respectively 
these revenues resulted from purchases at market rates pursuant to executed binding agreements 
however  in connection with our restatement announced in april  we reversed all advertising revenues  approximately million  from two set top terminal manufacturers recognized in based on a reassessment of the underlying structure of the arrangements during  the prices paid for the set top terminals and the advertising revenue recognized were determined to be in excess of fair value 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of prior results 
pricing for our products and services our revenues are derived principally from the monthly fees our customers pay for the services we offer 
a one time installation fee  which is often waived during certain promotional periods for a standard installation  is charged to new customers 
the prices we charge vary based on the level of service the customer chooses and the particular geographic market 
most of our pricing is reviewed and adjusted on an annual basis 
in accordance with the federal communications commission s rules  the prices we charge for cable related equipment  such as set top terminals and remote control devices  and for installation services are based on actual costs plus a permitted rate of return 

table of contents although our cable service offerings vary across the markets we serve because of various factors including competition and regulatory factors  our services  when offered on a stand alone basis  are typically offered at monthly price ranges  excluding franchise fees and other taxes  as follows price range as of service december  analog video packages premium channel pay per view per movie or event digital video packages including high speed data service for higher tiers high speed data service video on demand per selection high definition television in addition  from time to time we offer free service or reduced price service during promotional periods in order to attract new customers 
there is no assurance that these customers will remain as customers when the period of free service expires 
our network technology we have substantially completed the build out of our systems to a minimum bandwidth of megahertz or greater  which enables us to offer digital television  high speed data services and other advanced services  offer up to analog channels  and even more channels when our bandwidth is used for digital signal transmission  and permit two way communication for internet access and interactive services  and potentially  telephony services 
as part of the upgrade of our systems during the last several years  we reduced the number of headends that serve our customers from  at january  to at december  because headends are the control centers of a cable system  where incoming signals are amplified  converted  processed and combined for transmission to the customer  reducing the number of headends reduces related equipment  service personnel and maintenance expenditures 
we expect that headend consolidation  together with our other upgrades  will allow us to provide enhanced picture quality and greater system reliability 
as a result of the upgrade  approximately of our customers were served by headends serving at least  customers as of december  the following table sets forth the technological capacity of our systems as of december  megahertz less than to two way two way megahertz megahertz megahertz megahertz capability enabled see products and services for statistics regarding the approximate number of our customers who purchase the various services enabled by these upgrades 
as of december  our cable systems consisted of approximately  strand miles  including approximately  strand miles of fiber optic cable  passing approximately million households and serving approximately million customers 
we adopted the hybrid fiber coaxial cable hfc architecture as the standard for our systems upgrades 
hfc architecture combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable 
fiber optic cable is a communication medium that uses glass fibers to transmit signals over long distances with minimum signal loss or distortion 
fiber optic cable has excellent broadband frequency characteristics  noise immunity and physical durability and can carry 
table of contents hundreds of video  data and voice channels over extended distances 
coaxial cable is less expensive and requires a more extensive signal amplification in order to obtain the desired transmission levels for delivering channels 
in most systems  we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes  and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes passed served by that node 
our system design enables a maximum of homes passed to be served by a single node 
currently  our average node serves approximately homes passed 
our system design provides for six strands of fiber to each node  with two strands activated and four strands reserved for spares and future services 
we believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and superior signal quality 
the design also provides reserve capacity for the addition of future services 
the primary advantages of hfc architecture over traditional coaxial only cable networks include increased bandwidth capacity  for more channels and other services  dedicated bandwidth for two way services  which avoids reverse signal interference problems that can occur with two way communication capability  and improved picture quality and service reliability 
we currently maintain a national network operations center to monitor our data networks and to further our strategy of providing high quality service 
monitoring previously done by our regional operations centers has been migrated to our national network operations center 
centralized monitoring becomes increasingly important as we increase the number of customers utilizing two way high speed data service 
our local dispatch centers focus primarily on monitoring the hfc plant  also replacing our existing regional operating centers 
management of our systems many of the functions associated with our financial management are centralized  including accounting  billing  finance and acquisitions  payroll and benefit administration  information system design and support  internal audit  purchasing  marketing  programming contract administration and internet service  network and circuits administration 
to improve efficiency and operational consistency throughout our systems  we have consolidated from three divisions and ten regions to five operating divisions  eliminating certain layers of middle management 
each division is supported by operational  financial  marketing and engineering functions 
the reorganization has facilitated the establishment of and adherence to standard practices  charter branding throughout our systems and improved internal communication 
we believe these improvements enhance consistency of service delivery 
customer care historically  we have fielded customer service requests  inquiries and complaints through a large number of small customer service centers throughout the country 
as a consequence of our aggressive acquisition program in through  the number of these service centers grew rapidly and in was in excess of service centers 
we believe that maintaining such a large number of service centers hindered our ability to maximize the consistency of our service delivery and related customer satisfaction due to the logistical challenges and poor economies of scale inherent in maintaining and supervising such a large number of service centers 
in an effort to better serve our customers  we are consolidating our local customer care functions by operating technologically advanced  high volume customer contact centers  and as a result we have closed and expect to continue to close a number of local payment and customer service centers 
by establishing regional customer contact centers  we are able to service our customers hours a day  seven days a week and utilize technologically advanced equipment that we believe enhances interactions with our customers 
our customer care specialists receive specialized training to develop customer contact skills and product knowledge that are targeted towards prompt and responsive resolution of customer complaints and customer retention  as well as towards selling additional and higher levels of service to our customers 
as of december   we had customer service locations  and our largest customer service locations serviced approximately of our customers 

table of contents sales and marketing charter and its subsidiaries have a single team responsible for overseeing the sales and marketing strategies of our individual systems 
for most of our systems with over  customers  an assigned marketing manager implements our marketing decisions  while smaller systems are handled at the divisional level 
due to our focus in on certain other operational matters and due to certain financial constraints  we reduced spending in on marketing our products and services 
for the year ended december   we had marketing expenditures of million 
we expect to increase our spending on marketing in our marketing efforts are intended to promote good interaction  quick information flow and sharing of best practices between our corporate office  which handles programs and administration  and our field offices  which implement our various marketing programs 
we monitor government regulation  customer perception  competition  pricing and product preferences  among other factors  to increase our responsiveness to our customers 
our coordinated marketing techniques include door to door solicitation  telemarketing  media advertising  e marketing  direct mail solicitation and retail locations 
we also market and sell our services through consumer electronics retailers and other retailers that sell televisions or cable modems 
in january  we introduced the first national branding campaign in charter s history 
the get hooked branding initiative will be a key focal point of our national marketing campaigns throughout the year  designed to promote our long term objective of increasing our cash flow through deeper market penetration and growth in revenue per customer 
our goal for is for our corporate team to produce six to eight national marketing campaigns employing our new national get hooked charter branding to promote customer awareness and loyalty  attract former customers and households that have never subscribed to our services  promote our advanced services such as dvr  high definition television  vod and svod with the goal that our customers will view their cable connection as one stop shopping for video  voice  high speed data and interactive services  promote our bundling of digital video and high speed data services and pricing strategies  and announce the launch of our advanced services as they become available in our systems 
programming general we believe that offering a wide variety of programming is an important factor that influences a customer s decision to subscribe to and retain our cable services 
we rely on market research  customer demographics and local programming preferences to determine channel offerings in each of our markets 
we obtain basic and premium programming from a number of suppliers  usually pursuant to a written contract 
our programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time  usually from three to ten years  and are subject to negotiated renewal 
some program suppliers offer financial incentives to support the launch of a channel and ongoing marketing support or launch fees 
we also negotiate volume discount pricing structures 
programming costs are usually payable each month based on calculations performed by us and are subject to adjustment based on the results of periodic audits by the programmers 
costs programming tends to be made available to us for a license fee  which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom we make such programming available 
such license fees may include volume discounts available for higher numbers of customers  channel placement or service penetration 
some channels are available without cost to us for a limited period of time  after which we pay for the programming 
for home shopping channels  we receive a percentage of the amount our customers spend on home shopping purchases 
our cable programming costs have increased  in every year we have operated  in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increases 
we expect them to continue to increase due to a variety of factors  including annual increases imposed by programmers  additional programming being provided to customers as a result of system rebuilds and bandwidth reallocation  both of which increase channel capacity  and 
table of contents increased cost for certain previously discounted programming 
in particular  sports programming costs have increased significantly over the past several years 
in addition  contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes contain built in cost increases for programming added during the term of the contract 
historically  we have been able to absorb increased programming costs through increased prices to our customers 
however  with the impact of competition and other marketplace factors  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so 
in order to maintain margins despite increasing programming costs  we plan to continue to migrate certain program services from our analog level of service to our digital tiers 
we expect that this migration will result in enhanced quality of programming offered on digital tiers and provide our video customers more value and more choice 
additionally  as we migrate our programming to our digital tier packages  certain programming that was previously available to all of our customers via an analog signal  may be part of an elective digital tier package 
as a result  the customer base upon which we pay programming fees will proportionately decrease  and the overall expense for providing that service would likewise decrease 
reductions in the size of certain programming customer bases may result in the loss of specific volume discount benefits 
we plan to seek to renegotiate the terms of our agreements with certain programmers as these agreements come due for renewal 
as measured by programming costs  and excluding premium services substantially all of which were renegotiated and renewed in  as of february  approximately of our current programming contracts are scheduled to expire by the end of  and approximately another by the end of there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms 
to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable  we may be forced to remove such programming channels from our line up by the programmers  which could result in a further loss of customers 
in addition  our inability to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our customers would have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins 
franchises as of december   our systems operated pursuant to a total of approximately  franchises  permits and similar authorizations issued by local and state governmental authorities 
each franchise is awarded by a governmental authority and such governmental authority often must approve a transfer to another party 
most franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach 
in addition  most franchises require us to pay the granting authority a franchise fee of up to of revenues as defined in the various agreements  which is the maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law 
we are entitled to and generally do pass this fee through to the customer 
prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises  we initiate renewal proceedings with the granting authorities 
this process usually takes three years but can take a longer period of time 
the communications act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals 
in connection with the franchise renewal process  many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make certain commitments 
historically we have been able to renew our franchises without incurring significant costs  although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise 
our failure to obtain renewals of our franchises  especially those in the major metropolitan areas where we have the most customers  would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or our liquidity  including our ability to comply with our debt covenants 
approximately of our franchises covering approximately of our video customers expire on or before december  we expect to renew substantially all of these franchises 
under the telecommunications act of the telecom act  state and local authorities are prohibited from limiting  restricting or conditioning the provision of telecommunications services 
they may  however  impose competitively neutral requirements and manage the public rights of way 
granting authorities may not require a cable operator to provide telecommunications services or facilities  other than institutional networks  as a condition of an initial franchise grant  a franchise renewal  or a franchise transfer 
the telecom act also limits franchise fees to an operator s cable related revenues and clarifies that they do not apply to revenues that a cable operator derives from providing new telecommunications services 
in a march decision  the federal communications commission fcc held that revenue derived from the provision of cable modem service should not be added to franchise fee payments already limited by federal law to of traditional cable service revenue 
the same decision tentatively limited local franchising authority regulation of cable modem service 
on october   the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit vacated in part the fcc s march decision and remanded for 
table of contents further proceedings 
the ninth circuit affirmed the portion of the fcc s march decision holding that cable modem service is not a cable service 
although the ninth circuit s decision should not subject cable operators to additional cable franchise fee requirements for the provision of cable modem service  it could possibly result in other telecommunications regulation 
competition we face competition in the areas of price  services  and service reliability 
we compete with other providers of television signals and other sources of home entertainment 
in addition  as we continue to expand into additional services such as high speed internet access and telephony  we face competition from other providers of each type of service 
we operate in a very competitive business environment  which can adversely affect our business and operations 
in terms of competition for customers  we view ourselves as a member of the broadband communications industry  which encompasses multi channel video for television and related broadband services  such as high speed data and other interactive video services 
in the broadband industry  our principal competitor for video services throughout our territory is direct broadcast satellite dbs  and in markets where it is available  our principal competitor for data services is digital subscriber line dsl 
we do not consider other cable operators to be significant one on one competitors in the market overall  as traditional overbuilds are infrequent and spotty geographically although in a particular market  a cable operator overbuilder would likely be a significant competitor at the local level 
as of december   we are aware of traditional overbuild situations impacting approximately of our total homes passed 
although cable operators tend not to be direct competitors for customers  their relative size may affect the competitive landscape in terms of how a cable company competes against non cable competitors in the market place as well as in relationships with vendors who deal with cable operators 
for example  a larger cable operator might have better access to and pricing for the multiple types of services cable companies offer 
also  a larger entity might have different access to financial resources and acquisition opportunities 
our key competitors include dbs direct broadcast satellite is a significant competitor to cable systems 
the dbs industry has grown rapidly over the last several years  far exceeding the growth rate of the cable television industry  and now serves more than million subscribers nationwide 
dbs service allows the subscriber to receive video and high speed internet access services directly via satellite using a relatively small dish antenna 
consistent with increasing consolidation in the communications industry  news corp  one of the world s largest media companies  recently acquired a controlling interest in directv  inc directv  the largest domestic dbs company 
this business combination could significantly strengthen directv s competitive posture  particularly through favorable programming arrangements with various news corp 
affiliates and subsidiaries  such as the fox television network 
in addition to the two established dbs providers  directv and echostar communications corporation echostar  cablevision systems corp 
launched a satellite enabling a third dbs provider  r l dbs company  llc  which commenced offering service in the fall of additionally  echostar and directv both have entered into joint marketing agreements with major telecommunications companies to offer bundled packages combining phone service  dsl and dbs services 
video compression technology and high powered satellites allow dbs providers to offer more than digital channels from a single transponder satellite  thereby surpassing the typical analog cable system 
in  major dbs competitors offered a greater variety of channel packages  and were especially competitive at the lower end pricing  such as a monthly price of approximately for channels compared to approximately for the closest comparable package in most of our markets 
in addition  while we continue to believe that the initial investment by a dbs customer exceeds that of a cable customer  the initial equipment cost for dbs has decreased substantially  as the dbs providers have aggressively marketed offers to new customers of incentives for discounted or free equipment  installation and multiple units 
dbs providers are able to offer service nationwide and are able to establish a national image and branding with standardized offerings  which together with their ability to avoid franchise fees of up to of revenues and property tax  leads to greater efficiencies and lower costs in the lower tiers of service 
however  we believe that most consumers continue to prefer our stronger local presence in our markets 
we believe that cable delivered vod and svod service are superior to dbs service because cable headends can store thousands of titles which customers can access and control independently  whereas dbs 
table of contents technology can only make available a much smaller number of titles with dvr like customer control 
we also believe that our higher tier products  particularly our bundled premium packages  are price competitive with dbs packages and that many consumers prefer our ability to economically bundle video packages with data packages 
further  cable providers have the potential in some areas to provide a more complete whole house communications package when combining video  high speed data and voice 
we believe that this  combined with the introduction of more new products that dbs cannot offer local high definition television and local interactive television differentiates us from dbs competitors and could enable us to win back some of our former customers who migrated to satellite 
recent joint marketing arrangements between dbs providers and telecommunications carriers allow similar bundling of services in certain areas 
dbs companies historically were prohibited from retransmitting popular local broadcast programming 
however  a change to the copyright laws in eliminated this legal impediment 
as a result  dbs companies now may retransmit such programming  once they have secured retransmission consent from the popular broadcast stations they wish to carry  and honor mandatory carriage obligations of less popular broadcast stations in the same television markets 
in response to the legislation  directv and echostar have begun carrying the major network stations in the nation s top television markets 
dbs  however  is limited in the local programming it can provide because of the current capacity limitations of satellite technology 
dbs companies currently offer local broadcast programming only in the larger us markets  although the number of markets covered is increasing 
directv is now providing two way high speed internet access services 
another satellite company called wildblue communications  inc formerly isky  inc reports that it plans to deliver two way high speed internet access to residential and small business markets in the contiguous united states and portions of canada in using the ka band and spot beam technology 
echostar is offering its video programming services with the internet services provided by earthlink  an internet service provider  using digital subscriber line technology 
in addition  echostar is using a recently launched satellite to test a dish based broadband service and hughes network systems is developing a new ka band broadband service for enterprise markets 
dsl the deployment of dsl allows internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds greater than those available over conventional telephone lines 
dsl service therefore is competitive with high speed internet access over cable systems 
several telephone companies which already have plant  an existing customer base  and other operational functions in place such as  billing  service personnel  etc 
and other companies offer dsl service 
dsl actively markets its service and many providers have offered promotional pricing with a one year service agreement 
the fcc has initiated a rulemaking proceeding that could materially reduce existing regulation of dsl service  essentially freeing such service from traditional telecommunications regulation 
it is also possible that federal legislation could reduce regulation of internet services offered by incumbent telephone companies 
legislative action and the fcc s decisions and policies in this area are subject to change 
we expect dsl to remain a significant competitor to our data services 
dsl and other forms of high speed internet access provide competition to our own provision of internet access 
for example  as discussed above  satellite based delivery options are in development 
in addition  local wireless internet services have recently begun to operate in many markets using available unlicensed radio spectrum 
this service option  popularly known as wi fi  offers another alternative to cable based internet access 
high speed internet access facilitates the streaming of video into homes and businesses 
as the quality and availability of video streaming over the internet improves  video streaming may compete with the traditional delivery of video programming services over cable systems 
it is possible that programming suppliers will consider bypassing cable operators and market their services directly to the consumer through video streaming over the internet 
we believe that pricing for residential and commercial data services on our system is generally comparable to that for similar dsl services and that some residential customers prefer our ability to bundle data services with video services 
however  dsl providers may currently be in a better position to offer data services to businesses since their networks tend to be more complete in commercial areas 
they also have the ability to bundle telephony with data services for a higher percentage of their customers  and that ability is appealing to many consumers 
recent joint marketing arrangements between dsl providers and dbs providers may allow some additional bundling of services 

table of contents broadcast television cable television has long competed with broadcast television  which consists of television signals that the viewer is able to receive without charge using an off air antenna 
the extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signals available through off air reception compared to the services provided by the local cable system 
traditionally  cable television has provided a higher picture quality and more channel offerings than broadcast television 
however  the recent licensing of digital spectrum by the fcc will provide traditional broadcasters with the ability to deliver high definition television pictures and multiple digital quality program streams  as well as advanced digital services such as subscription video and data transmission 
walt disney co 
recently announced the launching of a movie service that bypasses cable through direct access to homes by data streams sent over the television broadcast spectrum 
traditional overbuilds cable systems are operated under non exclusive franchises granted by local authorities 
more than one cable system may legally be built in the same area 
it is possible that a franchising authority might grant a second franchise to another cable operator and that such a franchise might contain terms and conditions more favorable than those afforded us 
in addition  entities willing to establish an open video system  under which they offer unaffiliated programmers non discriminatory access to a portion of the system s cable system  may be able to avoid local franchising requirements 
well financed businesses from outside the cable industry  such as public utilities that already possess fiber optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve  may over time become competitors 
there are a number of cities that have constructed their own cable systems  in a manner similar to city provided utility services 
there also has been interest in traditional overbuilds by private companies 
constructing a competing cable system is a capital intensive process which involves a high degree of risk 
we believe that in order to be successful  a competitor s overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses in the overbuilt area on a more cost effective basis than we can 
any such overbuild operation would require either significant access to capital or access to facilities already in place that are capable of delivering cable television programming 
as of december   we are aware of overbuild situations impacting approximately of our total homes passed and potential overbuild situations in areas servicing approximately of our total homes passed  together representing a total of approximately of our homes passed 
additional overbuild situations may occur in other systems 
in response to such overbuilds  these systems have been designated priorities for the upgrade of cable plant and the launch of new and enhanced services 
as of december   we have upgraded many of these systems to at least megahertz two way hfc architecture 
telephone companies and utilities the competitive environment has been significantly affected by technological developments and regulatory changes enacted under the telecom act  which was designed to enhance competition in the cable television and local telephone markets 
federal cross ownership restrictions historically limited entry by local telephone companies into the cable business 
the telecom act modified this cross ownership restriction  making it possible for local exchange carriers  who have considerable resources  to provide a wide variety of video services competitive with services offered by cable systems 
although telephone companies can lawfully enter the cable television business  activity in this area is currently quite limited 
local exchange carriers do provide facilities for the transmission and distribution of voice and data services  including internet services  in competition with our existing or potential interactive services ventures and businesses 
we cannot predict the likelihood of success of the broadband services offered by our competitors or the impact on us of such competitive ventures 
the entry of telephone companies as direct competitors in the video marketplace may become more widespread and could adversely affect the profitability and valuation of established cable systems 
as we expand our offerings to include internet access and other telecommunications services  we will be subject to competition from other telecommunications providers 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive and includes competitors with greater financial and personnel resources  who have brand name recognition and long standing relationships with regulatory authorities and customers 
moreover  mergers  joint ventures and alliances among franchise  wireless or private cable operators  local exchange carriers and others may result in providers capable of offering cable television  internet  and telecommunications services in direct competition with us 
for example  major local exchange carriers have entered into arrangements with echostar and directv in which they will market packages combining phone service  dsl and dbs services 

table of contents additionally  we are subject to competition from utilities which possess fiber optic transmission lines capable of transmitting signals with minimal signal distortion 
utilities are also developing broadband over power line technology  which will allow the provision of internet and other broadband services to homes and offices 
private cable additional competition is posed by satellite master antenna television systems  or smatv systems  serving multiple dwelling units  or mdus  such as condominiums  apartment complexes  and private residential communities 
these private cable systems may enter into exclusive agreements with such mdus  which may preclude operators of franchise systems from serving residents of such private complexes 
private cable systems can offer both improved reception of local television stations and many of the same satellite delivered program services that are offered by cable systems 
smatv systems currently benefit from operating advantages not available to franchised cable systems  including fewer regulatory burdens and no requirement to service low density or economically depressed communities 
exemption from regulation may provide a competitive advantage to certain of our current and potential competitors 
the fcc ruled in that private cable operators can lease video distribution capacity from local telephone companies and distribute cable programming services over public rights of way without obtaining a cable franchise 
in  both the fifth and seventh circuit courts of appeals upheld this fcc policy 
wireless distribution cable systems also compete with wireless program distribution services such as multi channel multipoint distribution systems or wireless cable  known as mmds  which uses low power microwave frequencies to transmit television programming over the air to paying customers 
wireless distribution services generally provide many of the programming services provided by cable systems  and digital compression technology increases significantly the channel capacity of their systems 
both analog and digital mmds services  however  require unobstructed line of sight transmission paths and mmds ventures have been quite limited to date 
the fcc recently completed its auction of multichannel video distribution data service mvdds licenses 
mvdds is a new terrestrial video and data fixed wireless service that the fcc hopes will spur competition in the cable and dbs industries 
regulation and legislation the following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry 
cable system operations are extensively regulated by the fcc  some state governments and most local governments 
a failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial penalties 
our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework  whether triggered by legislative  administrative  or judicial rulings 
congress and the fcc have expressed a particular interest in increasing competition in the communications field generally and in the cable television field specifically 
the telecom act altered the regulatory structure governing the nation s communications providers 
it removed barriers to competition in both the cable television market and the local telephone market 
at the same time  the fcc has pursued spectrum licensing options designed to increase competition to the cable industry by wireless multichannel video programming distributors 
we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new regulations that do not equally impact our key competitors 
congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation  and they are likely to do so in the future 
in addition  franchise agreements with local governments must be periodically renewed  and new operating terms may be imposed 
future legislative  regulatory  or judicial changes could adversely affect our operations 
we can provide no assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future 
cable rate regulation the cable industry has operated under a federal rate regulation regime for more than a decade 
the regulations currently restrict the prices that cable systems charge for basic service and associated equipment 
all other cable offerings are now universally exempt from rate regulation 
although rate regulation operates pursuant to a federal formula  local governments  commonly referred to as local franchising authorities  are primarily responsible for 
table of contents administering this regulation 
the majority of our local franchising authorities have never certified to regulate basic cable rates  but they retain the right to do so and order rate reductions and refunds  except in those specific communities facing effective competition 
federal law defines effective competition as existing in a variety of circumstances that historically were rarely satisfied  but are increasingly likely to be satisfied with the recent increase in dbs competition 
there have been frequent calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry 
confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming costs  it is possible that congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming 
such constraints could adversely affect our operations 
the federal rate regulations also require cable operators to maintain a geographically uniform rate within each community  except in those communities facing effective competition 
as we attempt to respond to a changing marketplace with competitive pricing practices  we may face legal restraints and challenges that impede our ability to compete 
must carry retransmission consent federal law currently includes must carry regulations  which require cable systems to carry certain local broadcast television stations that the cable operator would not select voluntarily 
alternatively  popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent  which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions 
either option has a potentially adverse effect on our business 
the burden associated with must carry could increase significantly if the fcc requires cable systems to simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of each television station  as the broadcast industry transitions from an analog to a digital format 
the burden could also increase significantly if the fcc requires cable systems to carry multiple program streams included within a single digital broadcast transmission 
although the fcc tentatively ruled against this expansion in a ruling  it is reviewing the issue and could reach a contrary result in the near future 
if these expanded must carry requirements were adopted  we would have less freedom over our distribution capacity 
access channels local franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels for public  educational and governmental access programming 
federal law also requires cable systems to designate a portion of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties 
increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable systems 
access to programming the fcc recently extended a regulation prohibiting video programmers affiliated with cable companies from favoring cable operators over new competitors and requiring such programmers to sell their satellite delivered programming to other multichannel video distributors 
this provision limits the ability of vertically integrated cable programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable companies 
dbs providers traditionally had no similar restriction on exclusive programming  but the fcc recently imposed that restriction as part of its approval of the directv news corp 
merger 
the fcc has also adopted regulations to avoid unreasonable conduct in retransmission consent negotiations between broadcasters and multichannel video programming distributors  including cable and dbs 
it recently imposed special conditions on the directtv news corp 
merger  including a requirement that fox affiliated broadcast stations enter into commercial arbitration for disputes over retransmission consent 
given the heightened competition and media consolidation that charter faces  it is possible that we will find it increasingly difficult to gain access to popular programming at favorable terms 
such difficulty could adversely impact our business 
ownership restrictions federal regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of ownership restrictions  which limited the size of certain media entities and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises 
through a series of legislative  regulatory  and judicial actions  most of these restrictions recently were eliminated or substantially relaxed 
for example  historic restrictions on local exchange carriers offering cable service within their telephone service area  as well as those prohibiting broadcast stations from owning cable systems within their broadcast service area  no longer exist 
changes in this regulatory area  including some still subject to judicial review  could 
table of contents alter the business landscape in which we operate  as formidable new competitors including electric utilities  local exchange carriers  and broadcast media companies may increasingly choose to offer cable services 
the relaxation of ownership restrictions could  for example  simplify comcast corporation s recent bid for walt disney company  notwithstanding overlapping cable and broadcast properties 
the fcc previously adopted regulations precluding any cable operator from serving more than of all domestic multichannel video subscribers and from devoting more than of the activated channel capacity of any cable system to the carriage of affiliated national video programming services 
these cable ownership restrictions were invalidated by the courts  and the fcc is now considering adoption of replacement regulations 
internet service over the past several years  proposals have been advanced at the fcc and congress that would require cable operators offering internet service to provide non discriminatory access to unaffiliated internet service providers 
several local franchising authorities actually adopted mandatory open access requirements  but various federal courts rejected each of these actions  relying on different legal theories 
it remains unclear today precisely what regulatory regime ultimately will be applied to the cable industry s high speed internet service 
the fcc has ruled that cable modem service is an interstate information service  rather than a cable or telecommunications service 
this classification left cable modem service exempt from the burdens associated with traditional cable and telecommunications regulation 
however  the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit recently vacated in part the fcc s ruling and remanded for further proceedings 
the ninth circuit held that cable modem service is not cable service  but is part telecommunications service and part information service 
various parties have sought en banc review of this ninth circuit decision 
although the fcc previously suggested that regulatory forbearance of cable modem service would be appropriate  regardless of the technical classification ultimately assigned to it  a number of technology companies continue to press the fcc to subject cable modem service to certain nondiscrimination principles 
the final regulatory status of cable modem service remains uncertain 
its outcome could materially affect our business 
it could also affect whether local franchising authorities can collect franchise fees on cable modem service and whether cable systems will have any payment obligations to the federal government s universal service fund 
as the internet has matured  it has become the subject of increasing regulatory interest 
there is now a host of federal laws affecting internet service  including the digital millennium copyright act  which affords copyright owners certain rights against us that could adversely affect our relationship with any customer accused of violating copyright laws 
recently enacted anti spam legislation also imposes new obligations on our operations 
moreover  congress has not yet extended the five year moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access  which expired in late taxation of internet access or the adoption of new internet regulations could adversely affect our business 
phone service the telecom act created a more favorable regulatory environment for us to provide telecommunications services 
in particular  it limited the regulatory role of local franchising authorities and established requirements ensuring that we could interconnect with other telephone companies to provide a viable service 
many implementation details remain unresolved  and there are substantial regulatory changes being considered that could impact  in both positive and negative ways  our primary telecommunications competitors and our own entry into the field of phone service 
the fcc and state regulatory authorities are considering  for example  whether common carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carriers should be modified and how new alternative technologies  like voip  should be regulated 
it is unclear how these proceedings will be resolved and how they will affect charter s potential expansion into phone service 
pole attachments the communications act requires most utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits and simultaneously regulates the rates charged for this access 
the act specifies that significantly higher rates apply if the cable plant is providing telecommunications service  as well as traditional cable service 
the fcc has clarified that a cable operator s favorable pole rates are not endangered by the provision of internet access 
although that determination was upheld by the united states supreme court  a subsequent decision by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit regarding the proper regulatory classification of internet service has once again 
table of contents created controversy in this area 
it remains possible that the underlying pole attachment formula  or its application to internet and telecommunications offerings  will be modified in a manner that substantially increases our pole attachment costs 
cable equipment the fcc has undertaken several steps to promote competition in the delivery of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technology 
the fcc has expressly ruled that cable customers must be allowed to purchase set top terminals from third parties and established a multi year phase in during which security functions which would remain in the operator s exclusive control would be unbundled from the basic converter functions  which could then be provided by third party vendors 
the first phase of implementation has already passed 
a prohibition on cable operators leasing digital set top terminals that integrate security and basic navigation functions is currently scheduled to go into effect as of july  the fcc recently adopted rules implementing an agreement between major cable operators and manufacturers of consumer electronics on plug and play specifications for one way digital televisions 
the rules require cable operators to provide cablecard security modules and support to customer owned digital televisions and similar devices already equipped with built in set top terminal functionality 
cable operators must support basic home recording rights and copy protection rules for digital programming content 
the fcc has adopted companion broadcast flag rules  requiring cable carriage of a code embedded in digital broadcast programming that will regulate the further use of copyright programming 
the fcc is conducting additional related rulemakings  and the cable and consumer electronics industries are currently negotiating an agreement that would establish additional plug and play specifications for two way digital televisions 
the fcc rules are subject to challenge and inter industry negotiations are ongoing 
it is unclear how this process will develop and how it will affect our offering of cable equipment and our relationship with our customers 
other communications act provisions and fcc regulatory matters in addition to the communications act provisions and fcc regulations noted above  there are other statutory provisions and fcc regulations affecting our business 
the communications act  for example  includes cable specific privacy obligations 
the act carefully limits our ability to collect and disclose personal information 
fcc regulations include a variety of additional areas  including  among other things equal employment opportunity obligations  customer service standards  technical service standards  mandatory blackouts of certain network  syndicated and sports programming  restrictions on political advertising  restrictions on advertising in children s programming  restrictions on origination cablecasting  restrictions on carriage of lottery programming  sponsorship identification obligations  closed captioning of video programming  licensing of systems and facilities  and maintenance of public files 
it is possible that the fcc will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems in the future  and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact our business 
copyright cable systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals 
the possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming 
we cannot predict the outcome of this legislative activity 
moreover  the copyright office has not yet provided any guidance as to the how the compulsory copyright license should apply to newly offered digital broadcast signals 
copyright clearances for non broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations 
cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations 
these licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past  and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future 
franchise matters cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to cross public rights of way 
cable franchises generally are granted for fixed 
table of contents terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions 
the specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary materially between jurisdictions 
each franchise generally contains provisions governing cable operations  franchise fees  system construction  maintenance  technical performance  and customer service standards 
a number of states subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies  such as public utility commissions 
although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms  there are certain federal protections 
for example  federal law caps local franchise fees and includes renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees from arbitrary denials of renewal 
even if a franchise is renewed  however  the local franchising authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requirements as a condition of renewal 
similarly  if a local franchising authority s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system  the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent

in general  the lawsuits allege that charter utilized 
table of contents misleading accounting practices and failed to disclose these accounting practices and or issued false and misleading financial statements and press releases concerning charter s operations and prospects 
the federal class actions were specifically and individually identified in public filings made by charter prior to the date of this annual report 
in october  charter filed a motion with the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation the panel to transfer the federal class actions to the eastern district of missouri 
on march   the panel transferred the six federal class actions not filed in the eastern district of missouri to that district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings with the eight federal class actions already pending there 
the panel s transfer order assigned the federal class actions to judge charles a

no reserves have been established for potential losses or related insurance recoveries on these matters because we are unable to predict the outcome 
charter intends to vigorously defend the lawsuits 
government investigations in august  charter became aware of a grand jury investigation being conducted by the us attorney s office for the eastern district of missouri into certain of its accounting and reporting practices  focusing on how charter reported customer numbers  and its reporting of amounts received from digital set top terminal suppliers for advertising 
the us attorney s office has publicly stated that charter is not currently a target of the investigation 
charter has also been advised by the u 
s 
attorney s office that no member of its board of directors  including its chief executive officer  is a target of the investigation 
on july   a federal grand jury charged four former officers of charter with conspiracy and mail and wire fraud  alleging improper accounting and reporting practices focusing on revenue from digital set top terminal suppliers and inflated customer account numbers 
on july  one of the former officers who was indicted entered a guilty plea 
we are fully cooperating with the investigation 
on november   charter received an informal  non public inquiry from the staff of the sec 
the sec has subsequently issued a formal order of investigation dated january   and subsequent document and testimony subpoenas 
the investigation and subpoenas generally concern charter s prior reports with respect to its determination of the number of customers  and various of its accounting policies and practices including its capitalization of certain expenses and dealings with certain vendors  including programmers and digital set top terminal suppliers 
we are fully cooperating with the sec staff 
indemnification we are generally required to indemnify each of the named individual defendants in connection with the matters described above pursuant to the terms of our bylaws and where applicable such individual defendants employment agreements 
in accordance with these documents  in connection with the pending grand jury investigation  sec investigation and the above described lawsuits  some of our current and former directors and our

other litigation in october  two customers  nikki nicholls and geraldine m 
barber  filed a class action suit against charter in south carolina court of common pleas south carolina class action  purportedly on behalf of a class of charter customers  alleging that charter improperly charged them a wire maintenance fee without request or permission 
they also claimed that charter improperly required them to rent analog and or digital set top terminals even though their television sets were cable ready 
charter removed this case to the united states district court for the district of south carolina in november  and moved to dismiss the suit in december the federal judge remanded the case to the south carolina court of common pleas in august without ruling on the motion to dismiss 
the plaintiffs subsequently moved for a default judgment  arguing that upon return to state court  charter should have but did not file a new motion to dismiss 
the state court judge granted the plaintiff s motion over charter s objection in september charter immediately appealed that decision to the south carolina court of appeals and the south carolina supreme court  but those courts have ruled that until a final judgment is entered against charter  they lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal 
in january  the court of common pleas granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification 
in october and november  charter filed motions a asking that court to set aside the default judgment  and b seeking dismissal of plaintiffs suit for failure to state a claim 
in january  the court of common pleas granted in part and denied in part charter s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim
