overview we provide a suite of solutions that automate employee centric processes and provide tools to optimize the workforce 
our solutions  which include human resources  payroll  scheduling and time and labor applications  are designed for a wide range of businesses from single site to large multisite enterprises 
we derive revenues from the licensing of our software solutions  sales of our hardware solutions and by providing professional services as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
we have been successful in continuing to increase revenues in all periods presented 
while we believe that the current economic environment is improving  certain factors such as a lack of job creation and the apparent lag in technology purchasing in the current economic recovery  as well as the diversion of resources toward compliance with new regulatory requirements on internal controls  may result in many customers deferring or reducing their technology purchases in the future 
our revenues in fiscal increased million  or over fiscal continued growth in all components of our business contributed to this growth 
product revenues increased million  or  maintenance revenues increased million  or  and professional services revenues increased million  or 
net income for fiscal increased to million from million  with earnings per share increasing to from per diluted share 
net income growth for fiscal was primarily the result of our leveraging growth in revenues to increase gross margins  an improvement in productivity in sales and marketing to drive higher volume of revenues  and to a lesser extent continued corporate wide efforts to contain costs  and a reduction in the income tax rate  primarily resulting from the resolution of certain tax audits during fiscal although we will continue our efforts to contain costs  our ongoing investments in infrastructure and the costs associated with the integration of acquired businesses may partially offset these efforts in the near term 
regarding expectations for fiscal  we presently anticipate that revenue growth  excluding revenues from customers obtained in the acquisition of businesses to range between for the entire fiscal and for the first quarter of fiscal  with earnings per share in the range of for the entire fiscal and for the first quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
please refer to note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
revenue recognition we license software and sell data collection hardware and related ancillary products to end user customers through our direct sales force as well as indirect channel customers  which include automatic data processing  inc  or adp  and other independent resellers 
substantially all of our software license revenue is earned from perpetual licenses of off the shelf software requiring no modification or customization 
the software license  data collection hardware and related ancillary product revenues from our end user customers and indirect channel customers are generally recognized using the residual method when o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is typically when a non cancelable sales and software license agreement has been signed  o delivery  which is typically fob shipping point  is complete for the software either physically or electronically  data collection hardware and related ancillary products  o the customer s fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  o collectibility is probable  and o vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  typically maintenance and professional services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
substantially all of our product revenue is recognized in this manner 
if we cannot determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in an arrangement  we will defer revenue until all elements are delivered  services are performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
as part of an arrangement  end user customers typically purchase maintenance contracts as well as professional services from us 
maintenance services include telephone and web based support as well as rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements  when and if we make them generally available 
professional services are deemed to be non essential to the functionality of the software and typically are for implementation planning  loading of software  installation of the data collection hardware  training  building simple interfaces  running test data  and assisting in the development and documentation of pay rules and best practices consulting 
revenues from maintenance services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract period based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the amount charged when purchased separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
maintenance services are typically stated separately in an arrangement 
we have classified the allocated fair value of revenues pertaining to the contractual maintenance obligations that exist for the month period subsequent to the balance sheet date as a current liability  and the contractual obligations with a term beyond months as a non current liability 
revenues from time and material customer support services are recognized as the services are delivered 
revenues from professional services are generally recognized based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when o a non cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customer s purchase order has been received  o the professional services have been delivered  o the customer s fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and o collectibility is probable 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the price charged when these services are sold separately and are typically an hourly rate for professional services and a per class rate for training 
based upon our experience in completing product implementations  we have determined that these services are typically delivered within a month period subsequent to the contract signing and therefore have classified deferred professional services as a current liability 
our arrangements with end user customers and indirect channel customers do not include any rights of return or price protection  nor do arrangements with indirect channel customers include any acceptance provisions 
our arrangements with end user customers generally include our standard acceptance provision 
our standard acceptance provision provides the end user customer with a right to a refund if the arrangement is terminated because the product did not meet our published technical specifications 
generally  we determine that these acceptance provisions are not substantive and therefore should be accounted for as a warranty in accordance with sfas no 
at the time we enter into an arrangement  we assess the probability of collection of the fee and the terms granted to the customer 
for end user customers  our typical payment terms include a deposit and subsequent payments  based on specific due dates  such that all payments for the software license  data collection hardware and related ancillary products  as well as services included in the original arrangement  are ordinarily due within one year of contract signing 
our payment terms for indirect channel customers are less than days and payments are typically due within days of the invoice date 
if the arrangement includes a substantive acceptance provision  we defer revenue not meeting the criterion for recognition under statement of position  software revenue recognition  and classify this revenue as deferred revenue  including deferred product revenue 
this revenue is recognized  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied  when the uncertainty regarding acceptance is resolved as generally evidenced by written acceptance or payment of the arrangement fee 
if the payment terms for the arrangement are considered extended  other than those arrangements that are financing arrangements as discussed below  we defer revenue on the arrangement until the payment of the arrangement fee becomes due 
the deferred amounts related to arrangements with extended payment terms are removed from deferred revenue and accounts receivable  as we have determined that these amounts do not represent either a receivable or deferred revenue until the payment becomes due 
we report the allocated fair value of revenues related to the product element of arrangements as a current liability because of the expectation that these revenues will be recognized within months of the balance sheet date 
since fiscal  we have had a standard practice of providing creditworthy end user customers the option of financing arrangements beyond one year 
our policy for recognizing revenue and the timing of the recognition for arrangements that are financed is the same as our non financed arrangements 
the financed arrangements  which encompass separate fees for software license  data collection hardware and ancillary products  maintenance and support contracts  and professional services  are evidenced by distinct standard sales  license and maintenance agreements and typically require equal monthly payments 
the terms of these arrangements typically range between and months 
at the time we enter into an arrangement  we assess the probability of collection and whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
we consider our history of collection without concessions as well as whether each new transaction involves similar customers  products and arrangement economics to ensure that the history developed under previous arrangements remains relevant to current arrangements 
if the fee is not determined to be collectible  fixed or determinable  we will initially defer the revenue and recognize it when collection becomes probable  which typically is when payment is due  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
as a financing arrangement  we apply a present value factor using interest rates ranging from to 
these rates may vary depending upon when the financing arrangement is entered into and the length of the financing arrangement 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on estimates made by us after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging and bad debt history 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
in addition  we maintain a sales returns allowance to reflect estimated losses for sales returns and adjustments 
sales returns and adjustments are generally due to incorrect ordering of product  general customer satisfaction issues or incorrect billing 
this allowance is established by us using estimates based on historical experience 
if we experience an increase in sales returns and adjustments  additional allowances and charges against revenue may be required 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
for intangible assets  this evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over their estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit that houses goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
we have only one reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon the net present value of future cash flows  including a terminal value calculation 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed its carrying value  then further analysis would be required to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
if we determine that there is an impairment in either an intangible asset or goodwill  we will be required to record an impairment charge in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
during fiscal and fiscal  we completed the annual testing of the impairment of goodwill  and as a result of these tests  we concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed as of july  or june   the annual goodwill impairment measurement dates for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  we have determined that no events or circumstances currently exist or existed during fiscal or fiscal that would indicate that either the fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced  or the carrying value of the intangible assets is no longer recoverable 
therefore  no impairment charges have been recorded in fiscal or capitalization of software development costs costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established 
thereafter  software development costs are capitalized and amortized to product cost of sales on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or the estimated economic lives of the respective products 
costs incurred in the development of software for internal use are charged to expense until it becomes probable that future economic benefits will be realized 
thereafter  certain costs are capitalized and amortized to operating expense on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or the estimated economic life of the software 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations revenues 
we derive revenues from the licensing of our software solutions  sales of our hardware solutions and by providing professional services as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
total revenues dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal total revenues    the principal factors driving revenue growth in fiscal and were increased demand for our software and hardware products from new customers  and continued demand for our professional and maintenance services from new and existing customers  as well as revenues from acquired businesses 
fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues from acquired businesses    percentage of total revenues revenues from acquired businesses are revenues generated from customers that have been part of an acquired business transaction over the preceding four fiscal quarters 
product revenues dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product revenues    product revenues as a percent of total revenues product revenues grew in fiscal primarily due to an increase in customer demand for our workforce central suite and related software modules  our kronos iseries central suite  as well as our kronos terminal 
the increased demand was primarily the result of the introduction of new software modules  as well as new and platform conversion sales 
the rate of product revenue growth and the decline in the proportion of product revenues to total revenues was principally due to the high product sales volume in fiscal also impacting the rate of product revenue growth was the growth in deferred product revenues recorded on our balance sheet 
deferred product revenue increased from million at september   to million at september  in addition  the product revenues in fiscal benefited less from incremental revenues from acquired businesses due to the timing of acquisitions than in fiscal the principal factors driving product revenue growth in fiscal were increased demand for our kronos terminal  as well as software capacity upgrades and platform conversions eg  conversions by our customers from our windows product to the current workforce central product  which is web based 
fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues from acquired businesses    percentage of product revenues maintenance revenues dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal maintenance revenues    maintenance revenues as a percent of total revenues the increase in maintenance revenues in fiscal and fiscal was principally the result of expansion of the installed base and an increase in the dollar value of maintenance contracts 
the increase in the dollar value of the maintenance contracts was principally attributable to the sales of platform and capacity upgrade licenses to existing customers 
platform and capacity upgrade sales typically result in an increase in the dollar value of maintenance contracts due to the higher dollar value typically associated with the new platform s product or increased dollar value in the product resulting from the additional capacity 
the maintenance dollar value is typically based on the related product s dollar value 
the reduced rate of maintenance revenue growth experienced in fiscal as compared to the rate of growth experienced in fiscal was primarily due to the large proportion of maintenance renewals from our existing installed base  which annual growth rate is substantially lower than the growth experienced from new customers  as well as the timing of acquisitions 
fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues from acquired businesses    percentage of maintenance revenues professional services revenues dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal professional services revenues    professional services revenues as a percent of total revenues the growth in professional services revenues in fiscal and fiscal was principally due to an increase in customer demand for professional services  which was the result of an increase in product sales to new customers 
also contributing to the growth in professional services revenue was an increase in the level of professional services accompanying new and platform conversion sales  which resulted in the delivery of additional professional services hours during the implementations 
further contributing to the growth of the professional services revenue in fiscal and fiscal was an increase in the utilization rate experienced in the services organization in both years as compared to the prior fiscal year 
fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues from acquired businesses    percentage of professional services revenues international revenues dollars in thousands international revenues include revenues from our international subsidiaries and sales to independent international resellers 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal international revenues    international revenues as a percent of total revenues the growth in international revenues in fiscal and fiscal was primarily attributable to the timing of several large customer orders that were executed during both fiscal and we presently anticipate that international revenues in  excluding revenue from customers obtained in the acquisition of businesses  to remain relatively consistent with fiscal gross profit 
gross profit is the net result of revenues  less cost of sales 
product cost of sales primarily consists of salaries  facilities and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  costs of materials for the manufacturing of certain hardware products  amortization of capitalized software costs  as well as the cost of royalties paid to third parties for certain products 
service cost of sales primarily consists of salaries  facilities and related expenses for service personnel  as well as the cost of maintenance contracts paid to third parties for certain products 
gross profit gross margin dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product gross profit    service gross profit    total gross profit    product gross margin service gross margin total gross margin total gross margin increased in fiscal to from in fiscal due to an increase in product gross margin in fiscal this increase in product gross margin was partially offset by a higher proportion of services revenues  which typically carry a lower gross margin 
total gross margin in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal primarily due to a higher proportion of service revenues 
product gross margin increased in fiscal primarily due to a favorable product mix during the periods 
product revenues from hardware and software  which typically carry a higher gross margin than sales of third party product for resale  were a greater proportion of total product revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  a decrease in product gross margin related to a greater proportion of hardware revenues  which typically carry a lower gross margin than software revenues  was offset by a lower proportion of sales of third party product for resale 
although the proportion of professional services revenues which carries a lower gross profit than maintenance revenues to total service revenues in fiscal increased as compared to fiscal  the impact on service gross margin related to this unfavorable service mix was offset by an increase in the utilization rate of the service personnel as compared to fiscal the utilization rate increase was in part due to an increase in the productivity in our implementations related to sales of our human resources and payroll products 
although we anticipate continued productivity increases in our human resources and payroll implementations in fiscal due to improvements in our service delivery tools and processes  we expect these benefits to be partially offset by our continued investments in personnel and programs related to the promotion of kronos products and services to our largest customers 
net operating expenses 
net operating expenses includes sales and marketing expenses  engineering  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  amortization of intangible assets and other income  net 
total net operating expenses dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal net operating expenses    net operating expenses as a of total revenues the increase in total net operating expenses in fiscal and was principally attributable to investments in personnel and related compensation and overhead costs in response to increased customer demand and to support the development of new products 
the increase in total net operating expenses in fiscal was also attributable to an increase in the investments in information systems and infrastructure 
the increase in total net operating expenses in fiscal was also attributable to increased spending for outside consultants and professional fees related to engineering consulting fees and legal  audit and tax consulting fees 
the reduction in total net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in both fiscal and fiscal was attributable to the leveraging of investments in infrastructure to generate higher sales volumes  and continued corporate wide efforts to contain costs 
although we intend to continue efforts to contain costs and to leverage our infrastructure to generate higher sales volume  we anticipate that spending associated with the replacement of certain information systems  spending related to the development and introduction of new products  spending related to the introduction of a new sales force structure  as well as costs associated with compliance efforts related to new regulatory requirements on internal controls  will offset any savings realized through general corporate cost containment efforts  and we believe that net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain relatively consistent to fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and overhead related expenses for sales and marketing functions  as well as costs associated with advertising  promotions  tradeshows  seminars  training and other sales and marketing programs dollars in thousands 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal sales and marketing expenses    sales and marketing expenses as a of total revenues the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal and fiscal was primarily attributable to investment in sales personnel and related compensation and support costs to add new customers and to maximize the penetration of existing accounts  which includes the hiring of additional personnel 
in addition  the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal was also due to additional spending on programs related to the expansion of market awareness of our products and services  as well as additional spending for personnel training 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for both fiscal and fiscal was primarily attributable to leveraging the investments in infrastructure to generate higher sales volumes  as well as an improvement in productivity 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and overhead related expenses for engineering functions  as well as costs associated with training and third party consulting dollars in thousands 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal total engineering  research and development spending    capitalized software development costs    engineering  research and development expenses    engineering  research and development expenses as a of total revenues the increase in engineering  research and development spending in both fiscal and fiscal was attributable to continued investment in engineering personnel and their compensation related expenses 
this increase in spending was the result of the continued development and support of new products 
in addition  the increase in spending in fiscal was also attributable to an increase in training expenses  partially offset by the reallocation of certain engineering resources focused upon information systems support to general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in spending as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to higher sales volume in fiscal the significant project development efforts in fiscal were principally related to further development and enhancement of the workforce central suite  including scheduling  activities and workflow modules as well as workforce hr and workforce payroll software  and the kronos terminal 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and other overhead related expenses for administrative  information technology  finance  legal and human resources support functions dollars in thousands 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal general and administrative expenses    general and administrative expenses as a of total revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to investment in personnel and related compensation and support costs required for the continued support of our growing operations  which includes the hiring of additional personnel  and an increase in fees related to consulting services and training associated with the replacement of information technology systems 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to kronos investment in personnel and related compensation and support costs including those costs associated with the previously discussed reallocation of engineering resources to general and administrative expenses  an increase in fees related to tax planning and other professional services  and continued investment in infrastructure to support the growth of operations 
amortization of intangible assets and other income  net amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense related to the identified intangible assets recorded by us related to acquisitions of other businesses 
other income  net is principally interest income earned from cash as well as investments in our marketable securities and financing arrangements dollars in thousands 
fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal amortization of intangible assets    amortization of intangible assets as a of total revenues other income  net    other income  net as a of total revenues the increase in amortization of intangible assets in both fiscal and fiscal was principally attributable to amortization charges related to acquisitions that were completed during those years 
the increase in other income  net in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was principally attributable to the reversal of excess interest and other tax related accruals as a result of the favorable completion of certain tax audits during fiscal  as well as an increase in interest income generated from the increased portfolio of marketable securities 
these increases were partially offset by lower levels of foreign exchange gains realized during fiscal as a result of less favorable changes in foreign exchange rates experienced as compared to fiscal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the provision for income taxes was favorably impacted in fiscal as a result of the completion of certain tax audits during fiscal and certain tax planning strategies 
we currently anticipate that the income tax rate will range approximately between and in fiscal our effective income tax rate may fluctuate between periods as a result of various factors  including income tax credits  foreign tax rate differentials  state income taxes  and the resolution of tax audits or accruals for tax exposures 
newly issued accounting standards 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity as defined by its primary beneficiary 
primary beneficiaries are those companies that are subject to a majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns  or both 
in determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  a company with a variable interest must also treat a variable interest held by the company s related parties in that same entity as its own interest 
in december  the fasb published a revision to fin to clarify some of the provisions of fin and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
fin  as revised  applies to variable interest entities that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  our fiscal first quarter and for all other types of variable interest entities for periods ending after march  our fiscal second quarter 
we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of fin no 
and no 
did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on october   the fasb concluded that statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  would be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  retroactive application of the requirements of sfas no 
not sfas no 
r to the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the effective date would be permitted  but not required 
we would be required to apply sfas no 
r beginning with the fiscal quarter commencing on july   and could choose to apply sfas no 
retroactively from october  to july  the cumulative effect of applying sfas no 
 if any  would be measured and recognized upon adoption 
we have not yet determined the impact of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our business through cash generated by operations 
if near term demand for our products weakens  or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  the availability of such funds may be adversely impacted 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities dollars in thousands as of september  september  percent change cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities including short and long term   working capital   the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was due primarily to cash generated from operations 
the decrease in working capital was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenues of million  which includes increases in deferred product million  professional services million and maintenance revenues million 
although cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  this increase had limited impact on working capital as of september   as a significant portion of our cash reserves approximately million is invested in long term marketable securities 
cash flow highlights dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal cash provided by operations    cash used for property  plant and equipment    cash used for acquisitions of businesses    increases in marketable securities    net proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans    repurchases of common stock    the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase in net income  an increased rate of growth in our deferred product and maintenance revenues  and an increased rate of growth of accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of vendor payments and incentive payments 
these were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable during fiscal as compared to the same period in the prior year  which was attributable to an increase in sales volume associated with trade accounts receivable and financing arrangements beyond one year 
the accounts receivable balance from the prior year benefited from significant collection efforts  which offset any increases related to sales volume 
a decrease in the rate of growth in our deferred professional services revenues further offset the increases in net income  deferred product and maintenance revenue  and accounts payable and accrued expenses discussed above 
this decrease was attributable to an increase in our practice of billing customers in arrears as professional services are delivered rather than billing customers in advance of service delivery 
although cash flow from operations may be negatively impacted in the short term as our practice of billing in arrears increases  we believe this practice will benefit the sales cycle as it is consistent with industry practice 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal was principally attributable to higher net income  an increase in accruals related to taxes and compensation expenses due to the timing of payments  as well as increased non cash charges that are added back in the calculation of cash flow from operations 
these were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales volume 
our use of cash for property  plant and equipment in fiscal includes investments in information systems and infrastructure to improve and support expanding operations 
we anticipate making significant capital investments during fiscal in conjunction with the replacement of information technology systems 
to date  we have invested approximately million excluding internal personnel related costs related to this project  of which million has been capitalized  with the remainder expensed through operations 
we expect our total investment in this project excluding internal personnel related costs to range between million and million through the end of fiscal our use of cash for property  plant and equipment in fiscal includes investments in information systems and infrastructure to improve and support expanding operations 
our use of cash for the acquisition of businesses in all periods presented was principally related to the acquisitions of specified assets and or businesses of our resellers and or other providers of labor management solutions 
on november   we acquired  through kronos acquisition inc  a canadian corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary  approximately million common shares of ad opt technologies inc ad opt  a canadian corporation  representing approximately of the outstanding common shares  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately cdn million approximately usd million  net of cash and short term investments acquired of cdn million approximately usd million 
the company intends to exercise its rights to acquire all ad opt common shares that were not tendered to us through the compulsory acquisition provisions of the canada business corporations act 
the company anticipates that the aggregate purchase price for these common shares will be approximately cdn million approximately usd million 
the purchase price paid on november  was funded through the use of cash and investments shown on our balance sheet 
the purchase price anticipated to be paid for the remaining shares will also be funded through the use of cash and investments shown on our balance sheet 
we are assessing several other acquisition opportunities that may be completed over the next months  although there can be no assurance that these acquisitions will be completed 
excess cash reserves not required for operations  stock repurchases  investments in property  plant and equipment or acquisitions are invested in marketable securities 
stock repurchases under stock repurchase program dollars in thousands fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal shares of common stock repurchased    cost of shares of common stock repurchased    the common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program is used to partially cover the shares required for our employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we received million upon the maturity of a call option arrangement 
since the first quarter of fiscal  we have not had any outstanding call option arrangements 
please refer to note a in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding call option arrangements 
we lease certain office space  manufacturing facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements 
in addition  certain acquisition agreements contain provisions that require us to make a guaranteed payment and or contingent payments based upon profitability of the business unit or if specified minimum revenue requirements are met 
future minimum rental commitments under operating leases with non cancelable terms of one year or more  and future payment obligations related to guaranteed payments are as follows payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than year more than year  less than years more than years  less than years more than years operating lease obligations      guaranteed payment obligations   total      we believe that we have adequate cash and investments and operating cash flow to fund our investments in property  plant and equipment  software development costs  cash requirements under operating leases  cash payments related to acquisitions  if any  and any additional stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 
certain factors that may affect future operating results except for historical matters  the matters discussed in this annual report and or form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act and include this statement for the express purpose of availing ourselves of the protection of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual operating results may differ from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and or form k and presented elsewhere by us from time to time because of a number of factors including the potential fluctuations in quarterly results  timing and acceptance of new product introductions by us and our competitors  the dependence on our time and labor product line  the ability to attract and retain sufficient technical personnel  the protection of our intellectual property and the potential infringement on our intellectual property rights  competitive pricing pressure  and the dependence on alternate distribution channels and on key vendors  as further described below 
competition 
the workforce management market  which includes time and labor  scheduling  human resources and payroll  is highly competitive 
technological changes such as those allowing for increased use of the internet have resulted in new entrants into the market 
increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through price reductions and or loss of market share 
with our efforts to expand our workforce management offering with the introduction of our human resources and payroll product suite  and the expansion of our scheduling product offerings  we will continue to meet strong competition 
many of these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their human resources and payroll products 
many of our human resources and payroll competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources than us  as well as more experience in delivering human resources and payroll solutions 
although we believe our organization has core competencies that position us strongly in the marketplace  maintaining our technological and other advantages over competitors will require continued investment in research and development as well as marketing and sales programs 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or be able to achieve the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the human resources and payroll marketplace  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact upon our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
potential fluctuations in results 
our operating results  including revenue growth  sources of revenue  effective tax rate and liquidity  may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and related effect on workforce size  the purchasing patterns of our customers  the diversion of public companies resources to address compliance with new regulatory requirements on internal controls  mix of products and services sold  the ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations  the timing of the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us and our competitors  the strategy employed by us in the human resources and payroll market  market acceptance of new products  competitive pricing pressure and costs associated with the transition related to the replacement of our information technology systems 
we currently anticipate completing the transition to our new information technology systems during fiscal and we may experience some short term erosion to our productivity resulting from duplicate data entry  troubleshooting and mitigation of any issues related to the rollout of these systems 
we historically have realized a relatively larger percentage of our annual revenues and profits in the third and fourth quarters and a relatively smaller percentage in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year  although there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue 
in addition  substantially all of our product revenue and profits in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
if near term demand for our products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  our revenues for that quarter will be adversely affected 
we believe that our operating results for any one period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
dependence on time and labor product line 
to date  more than of our revenues have been attributable to sales of time and labor systems and related services 
although we have introduced products for scheduling solutions  and the licensed human resources and payroll market  we expect that our dependence on the time and labor product line for revenues will continue for the foreseeable future 
competitive pressures or other factors could cause our time and labor products to lose market acceptance or experience significant price erosion  adversely affecting the results of our operations 
product development and technological change 
continual change and improvement in computer software and hardware technology characterize the markets for workforce management systems 
our future success will depend largely on our ability to enhance the capabilities and increase the performance of our existing products and to develop new products and interfaces to third party products on a timely basis to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
although we are continually seeking to further enhance our workforce management offerings and to develop new products and interfaces  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that  if successful  such product enhancements or new products will achieve widespread market acceptance  or that our competitors will not develop and market products that are superior to our products or achieve greater market acceptance 
integration of acquired businesses 
as part of our overall growth strategy  we acquire from time to time resellers of our products and  in certain instances  complementary business lines 
even if we are successful in identifying and acquiring businesses strategic to us  these acquisition activities involve a number of risks  including o we may find the acquired business does not further our business strategy  that we overpaid for the company or the economic assumptions underlying our acquisition decision have changed or were not accurate  o difficulties integrating the acquired companies products and services and customer base with our existing product and service offerings  o difficulties integrating the operations  technology and personnel of an acquired company  or retaining the key personnel of the acquired company critical to its continued operation and success  o disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management s attention by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises  o difficulties maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations and businesses  o litigation by terminated employees or third parties  and o problems or liabilities associated with product quality  technology and legal contingencies relating to the acquired business or technology  such as intellectual property matters 
these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time 
acquisitions may also have a negative effect on our earnings per share 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions or investments in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition or investment 
to the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock  including options and warrants  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions and investments may result in the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs  such as acquired in process research and development costs  and restructuring charges 
they may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests  which could result in future impairment charges 
dependence on alternate distribution channels 
we market and sell our products through our direct sales organization  independent resellers and adp under an oem agreement 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated through sales to resellers and adp 
during fiscal we signed an agreement with adp extending our business relationship for an additional term of five years  and during fiscal  signed an amendment to that agreement which provides for minimum purchasing requirements and further extends the agreement for an additional six months 
a reduction in the sales efforts of either our major resellers or adp  or termination or changes in their relationships with us  could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
attracting and retaining sufficient technical personnel for product development  support and sales 
we have encountered intense competition for experienced technical personnel for product development  technical support and sales and expect such competition to continue in the future 
any inability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel could adversely affect our ability to produce  support and sell products in a timely manner 
protection of intellectual property 
we have developed  and through our acquisitions of businesses and software  acquired proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
our success is dependent upon our ability to further develop and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we seek to protect products  software  documentation and other written materials primarily through a combination of trade secret  patent  trademark and copyright laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  it is unknown whether we have been or will be successful in doing so 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that is regarded as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we can offer no assurance that we can adequately protect our proprietary rights or that our competitors will not reverse engineer or independently develop similar technology 
infringement of intellectual property rights 
we cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that our developed or acquired intellectual property rights infringe on their intellectual property rights or that we do not in fact infringe on those intellectual property rights 
any litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements  and in this event  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may also be subject to significant damages or an injunction against the use of our products 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could cause immediate and substantial damage to our business and financial condition 
additional stock option program information option program description 
we intend that our stock option program be our primary vehicle for offering long term incentives and rewarding executives and key employees 
stock options are granted to key employees based upon prior performance  the importance of our retaining their services and the potential for their performance to help us attain our long term goals 
however  there is no set formula for the award of options to individual executives or employees 
stock options are generally granted annually in conjunction with the compensation committee s formal review of the individual performance of key executives  including our chief executive officer  and their contributions to the company 
in fiscal  of the options granted went to employees other than our named executive officers as set forth in the table that follows 
all the options awarded are granted from the same plan 
options  which are granted at the fair market value on the date of grant  typically vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant and have a contractual life of four years and six months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments  foreign currency fluctuations and decreases in our common stock price affecting capped call options 
refer to note a  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding marketable securities  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and capped call option arrangements 
our marketable securities that expose us to market rate risks are comprised of debt securities 
a decrease in interest rates would not adversely impact interest income or related cash flows pertaining to securities held at september   as all of these securities have fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not adversely impact the fair value of these securities by a material amount due to the size and average duration of the portfolio 
our exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency relate primarily to the amounts due from subsidiaries 
exchange gains and losses related to amounts due from subsidiaries have not been material 
for foreign currency exposures existing at september   a unfavorable movement in the foreign exchange rates for each subsidiary location would not expose us to material losses in earnings or cash flows 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar
