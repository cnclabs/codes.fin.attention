item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   and certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in reference should also be made to our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
company overview business strategy maximizing the value of our existing core assets is the focal point of our business strategy 
our core assets are our fully integrated upstream and midstream assets in the powder river and greater green river basins in wyoming and colorado and our midstream operations in west texas  oklahoma and new mexico 
our long term business plan is to increase stockholder value by i doubling proven reserves and equity production of natural gas from the levels achieved in over a five year period  ii meeting or exceeding throughput projections in our midstream operations  and iii optimizing annual returns 
industry and company overview in north america  our industry has experienced several consecutive years of declining natural gas production 
most of the major gas producing areas  such as the gulf of mexico  are mature and are in production decline 
we are concentrating our efforts in the rocky mountain gas producing basins where there are estimated to be large quantities of undeveloped gas 
the us government largely retains the mineral rights to these undeveloped reserves  accordingly  the development and production of these reserves require permits from several governmental agencies including the blm 
we are well positioned for future production growth with a large inventory of undeveloped drilling locations in the powder river and greater green river basins to meet the growing demand for clean burning natural gas 
in addition  our experience and technical expertise position us to acquire new opportunities to develop natural gas in the rocky mountain region 
our challenges will be to accomplish these goals with the difficulties encountered by the industry in obtaining the necessary permits from the blm 
we believe that our technical expertise in developing environmentally responsible solutions to the problems encountered in the development of gas reserves will be a competitive advantage in overcoming these challenges 
our operations are conducted through the following four business segments upstream we explore for  develop and produce natural gas reserves independently and to enhance and support our existing gathering and processing operations 
our producing properties are primarily located in the powder river and green river basins of wyoming 
these plays are low risk  long lived development projects 
these provide us with the opportunity to steadily increase our production volume at low operating and finding and development costs 
in our production grew compared to levels and far exceeded the industry average for of a three percent decline in production 
our production level represented a increase towards meeting our goal of doubling our equity production of natural gas 
also benefiting us in were higher prices received for natural gas 
as a result operating income in this segment increased by to million in the year ended december  compared to at december   we had a total of bcfe of proved natural gas reserves in our various operating areas 
our business strategy is to double our proven reserves from those in place at december  by the end of at december   we are toward meeting this goal of doubling proved reserves 
we are also actively seeking to add additional upstream core projects that are focused on rocky mountain natural gas 
we will utilize our expertise in exploration and low risk development of tight gas sands  coal bed methane and fractured shale plays to evaluate acquisitions of either additional leaseholds  proven and undeveloped reserves or companies with operations focused in the rockies 
toward this goal  we have acquired the drilling rights on approximately  net acres  in the northeastern area of the denver julesburg basin in northeast colorado and southwest nebraska 
gathering  processing and treating our core operations are in well established areas such as the permian  anadarko  powder river  greater green river  and san juan basins 
we connect natural gas from gas and oil wells to our gathering systems for delivery to our processing or treating plants under long term contracts 
at our plants we process natural gas to extract ngls and we treat natural gas in order to meet pipeline specifications 
we provide these services to major oil and gas companies  to independent producers of various sizes and for our own production 
we believe that our low cost of operations  our high on line time  and our safety records are key elements in our ability to compete effectively and provide service to our customers 
our expertise in gathering  processing and treating operations can enhance the economics of developing new upstream projects 
this segment of our operations has provided a stream of operating profit that is available for reinvestment into other projects or other segments of our business 
in  we realized operating profit from this segment of million  which is a increase from this segment benefited from significantly higher product prices in compared and from increased drilling activity by third party producers behind our facilities 
overall throughput in our facilities during increased from and averaged a total of bcf per day 
transportation in the powder river basin  we own one interstate pipeline  migc  and one intrastate pipeline  mgtc  which transport natural gas for producers and energy marketers under fee schedules regulated by state or federal agencies 
in  we realized operating profit from this segment of million  which is a decrease from the decrease in profit in this segment is due to lower interruptible transportation volume in as more gas was transported out the basin through other pipelines 
marketing our gas marketing segment is an outgrowth of our gas processing and upstream activities 
one of the primary goals of our gas marketing operations is the preservation and enhancement of the value received for our equity volumes of natural gas 
this goal is achieved through the use of hedges on the production of our equity natural gas and ngls and through the use of firm transportation capacity 
we also buy and sell natural gas and ngls in the wholesale market in the united states and in canada 
these third party sales  our firm transportation capacity on interstate pipelines and our gas storage positions  combined with the stable supply of gas from our facilities and production  enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions and to take advantage of seasonal price variations and peak demand periods 
in order to protect the profitability of this segment  we continually monitor and review credit exposure to our marketing counterparties 
during  we experienced no uncollectible accounts 
in  we realized operating profit from this segment of million  which is a decrease from the decrease in operating profit is primarily due to lower profitability on transactions associated with our firm transportation capacity from the rocky mountain region to the mid continent 
our firm transportation allows us to purchase gas in the rocky mountain region for resale in the higher priced mid continent markets 
new transportation capacity added in out of the rocky mountain region has resulted in a decrease in the difference between the prices for natural gas received in this region compared to the prices received in the mid continent marketing area 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  s  except per share amounts and operating data year ended december  percent change financial results revenues   gross profit   net income   earnings per share of common stock earnings per share of common stock diluted net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in financing activities   operating data average gas sales mmcf d   average ngl sales mgal d   average gas prices mcf average ngl prices gal 

net income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase in net income was primarily attributable to a significant increase in gas and ngl prices in compared to last year 
this increase in prices was supplemented by increased equity production from the powder river basin cbm project and the green river basin 
partially offsetting the increase in net income in the year ended december  was a million after tax loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle from the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  revenues from the sale of gas increased million to  million for the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in product prices  which more than offset a decrease in sales volume in average gas prices realized by us increased per mcf to per mcf for the year ended december  compared to included in the calculation of the realized gas price were approximately million of losses recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity gas volumes 
we have entered into additional futures positions for approximately half of our equity gas for see further discussion in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
average gas sales volumes decreased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in third party sales volume resulting from the increase in product prices and an intentional effort to reduce related credit exposure 
revenues from the sale of ngls increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to this increase is primarily due to a significant increase in product prices  which was partially offset by a reduction in third party sales volumes 
average ngl prices realized by us increased per gallon to per gallon for the year ended december  compared to included in the calculation of the realized ngl price were approximately million of losses recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity ngl volumes 
we have entered into additional futures positions for approximately half of our equity ngl production for see further discussion in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
average ngl sales volumes decreased mgal per day to  mgal per day for the year ended december  compared to product purchases increased by million for the year ended december  compared to as a result of the significant increase in commodity prices 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products remained relatively constant at approximately for both and plant and transportation operating expense increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was primarily due to increased throughput at our facilities  the acquisition of several gathering systems in the first quarter of and additional leased compression in the powder river basin coal bed development 
also contributing to this increase were the fees paid to other companies  primarily rendezvous  for gas gathering services 
rendezvous is a owned entity that delivers gas to our granger complex 
rendezvous is accounted for under the equity method  and our share of its gathering revenues is reflected in earnings from equity investments 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased by million for the year ended december  compared to in our operating areas  the significant increase in residue gas prices in resulted in substantially higher severance tax expenses 
overall  lease operating expense  or loe  for the year ended december  increased by approximately per mcfe compared to and averaged per mcfe 
the increase in lease operating expense per mcfe is primarily due to unsuccessful well expenses of million in depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease was the result of revisions to the operating lives  and salvage values  of our operating assets partially offset by increased production in the powder river basin and additional depreciation in from new projects 
the revisions to the operating lives and salvage values of our operating assets were the result of analysis performed in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
on january  and were treated as a revision of an estimate and are accounted for on a prospective basis 
selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately million in the year ended december  as compared to this increase was the result of higher compensation expenses due to an increased employee count in resulting from our growing exploration and production operations  and a modification in to our incentive compensation plan to pay this compensation on a current basis as opposed to a vesting schedule used in prior years 
also contributing to the increase were higher professional fees resulting from litigation concluded in and our ongoing research associated with the cftc investigation of our price reporting to trade publications 
partially offsetting these increases were fewer charges for doubtful accounts in as compared to in  in order to properly align our hedged volumes of natural gas to our forecasted equity production  we discontinued hedge treatment on financial instruments for mmcf per day of natural gas and  barrels per month of ethane 
as a result  a pre tax loss of million was reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income 
cash flow information cash flows from operating activities increased by million in compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in net income in compared to the prior year and the timing of cash receipts and payables 
cash flows used in investing activities increased by million in compared to this increase was primarily due to a higher level of capital expenditures 
cash flows used in financing activities increased by million in compared to this increase was due to increased cash flows from operating activities  which was used to reduce our long term debt 
other information acquisition and disposition of gathering systems 
effective february   we acquired several gathering systems in wyoming  primarily located in the green river basin with smaller operations in the powder river and wind river basins  for a total of million 
several of the systems located in the powder river and wind river did not integrate directly into our existing systems  and accordingly these systems were sold 
during the year ended december   the income  if any  generated by the assets sold was immaterial for separate presentation as a discontinued operation 
acquisition of sand wash properties 
in august  through the acquisition of the stock of a private corporation for million  we acquired additional reserves  production and acreage in this area 
the assets of this private entity consisted primarily of the remaining interests in various sand wash properties that we operate 
this acquisition included approximately billion cubic feet equivalent  or bcfe  of proved reserves  mmcfe per day of production and approximately  net acres under lease 
segment information gas gathering  processing and treating 
the gas gathering  processing and treating segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase in operating profit in this segment in is primarily due to higher commodity prices  increased gathering volumes and the acquisition of several gathering systems in february exploration and production 
the exploration and production segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in operating profit in this segment in was primarily due to substantially higher natural gas prices and production volume growth from the powder river basin cbm area and the pinedale anticline 
marketing 
the marketing segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease in the marketing margin is primarily due to transactions associated with our firm transportation capacity from the rocky mountain region to the mid continent 
our firm transportation allows us to purchase gas in the rocky mountain region for resale in the higher priced mid continent markets 
in the second quarter of  additional transportation capacity out of the rocky mountain region became operational  which reduced the price difference between the two regions 
we expect that the reduced margins will continue in future periods 
there is no assurance that the margins we realized on the sale of gas in will continue in the future  or that we will continue to originate the same amount of transactions in future years 
transportation 
the transportation segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the transportation segment includes the results from the migc and mgtc pipelines in the powder river basin 
the decrease in profit in this segment is due to lower interruptible transportation volume in as more gas was transported out the basin through other pipelines 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  s  except per share amounts and operating data year ended december  percent change financial results revenues   gross profit   net income loss   earnings per share of common stock earnings per share of common stock diluted net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in financing activities   operating data average gas sales mmcf d   average ngl sales mgal d   average gas prices mcf average ngl prices gal 

net income decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to significantly lower gas and ngl prices in this period as compared to the prior year and lower margins per unit earned on our sales of natural gas 
these decreases more than offset increased production from the powder river basin cbm development 
revenues from the sale of gas decreased million to billion for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decline in product prices  which more than offset an increase in sales volume in the year ended december  average gas prices realized by us decreased per mcf to per mcf in the year ended december  compared to included in the realized gas price were approximately million of gains recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity gas volumes 
average gas sales volumes increased minimally to  mmcf per day in the year ended december  compared to revenues from the sale of ngls decreased approximately million to million in the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in product prices and to a reduction in sales volume 
average ngl prices realized by us decreased per gallon to per gallon in the year ended december  compared to included in the realized ngl price were approximately million of losses recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity ngl volumes 
average ngl sales volumes decreased mgal per day to  mgal per day in the year ended december  compared to product purchases decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of the decrease in commodity prices 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products decreased to for the year ended december  from for the decrease in the product purchase percentage for the year ended december  versus resulted from a decrease in product prices and an increase of sale of our production from the powder river basin development 
in the year ended december   we expensed a total of million for doubtful accounts  primarily due to the bankruptcy filing of a large mid western co op during the year 
this compared to an expense of million for doubtful accounts in these charges are not included in the calculation of the marketing margins and are reported in selling and administrative expenses 
plant and transportation operating expense increased by million in the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily due to additional leased compression  repair and maintenance and labor costs in the powder river basin coal bed development and higher property tax expenses at our plant facilities 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to in our operating areas  the significant reduction in residue gas prices in the periods resulted in substantially lower severance tax expenses 
these reductions were substantially offset by increased lease operating expenses  or loe  in the powder river basin coal bed development 
overall  loe averaged per mcf in the year ended december  loe in the powder river basin coal bed development averaged per mcf in the year ended december  this represented increases of per mcf and per mcf from the comparable periods in  respectively 
the increases were substantially due to higher utility charges  increased use of leased generators  increased labor charges and prior period adjustments for operating supplies  utilities and technical supervision billed to us by the well operator 
the increased loe in were substantially offset by lower severance taxes resulting from the significant reduction in residue gas prices in as compared to selling and administrative expenses increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to  due to higher health insurance costs and higher compensation expenses 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to primarily as a result of our increasing operations in the powder river basin cbm development 
the provision for income taxes increased to a effective rate for the year ended december  from in this change is due to increased sales of third party product in states with higher corporate tax rates and in canada 
cash flow information cash flows from operating activities decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in net income in compared to the prior year and the timing of cash receipts and payables 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures 
cash flows used in financing activities increased by million in the year ended december  compared to this increase was due to the application of the proceeds received in the sale of our toca processing facility in to reduce the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
other information toca processing facility 
in june  we entered into an agreement for the sale of our toca processing facility in louisiana 
this sale closed in september the sale price was million  subject to accounting adjustments  and resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately  the purchase price included a natural gas processing plant with a capacity of million cubic feet per day and a fractionator that can separate  barrels per day of mixed natural gas liquids into propane  normal butane  iso butane and natural gasoline 
the sale also includes ngl storage as well as truck  rail and barge loading facilities  which support the complex 
during the year ended december   this facility generated net after tax earnings of approximately  or 
per share of common stock  respectively 
approximately million of the proceeds received from this asset sale were initially used to reduce amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
at december   the remaining amount of million was on deposit with a trustee in anticipation of the completion of a like kind exchange transaction and was reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under the caption other current assets 
these funds  along with additional amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility  were used in a february acquisition of several gathering systems 
bethel treating facility 
in december  we signed an agreement for the sale of all the outstanding stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  pinnacle gas treating  inc  or pinnacle  for million 
the only asset of this subsidiary was a mmcf per day treating facility and miles of associated gathering assets located in east texas 
the sale closed in january and resulted in a net pre tax gain for financial reporting purposes of million in the first quarter of segment information gas gathering  processing and treating 
the gas gathering  processing and treating segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the decrease in operating profit in this segment in is primarily due to lower commodity prices  partially offset by gains in equity hedges 
exploration and production 
the exploration and production segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in operating profit in this segment in was primarily due to production volume growth from the powder river basin cbm area and the pinedale anticline  substantially offset by lower commodity prices 
marketing 
the marketing segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the margins earned from the sale of third party natural gas averaged and per mcf in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in margin for compared to primarily resulted from reduced margins associated with the mark to market of forward transactions in the current year versus the prior year 
this reduction in margin is primarily the result of our electing hedge accounting on several of our transactions in utilizing our firm transportation capacity and fewer long dated transactions utilizing our transportation capacity in place at the end of compared to under hedge accounting  the margin to be realized on a transaction is recorded in the month the transportation capacity is used  and under mark to market accounting  the anticipated margin on a transaction to be realized over the term of the transaction is recorded in the month of origination 
transportation 
the transportation segment realized segment operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the transportation segment includes the results from the migc and mgtc pipelines in the powder river basin 
critical accounting estimates the application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an interpretation and implementation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
for further details on our accounting policies  and the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in applying these policies and a discussion of new accounting rules  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
however  actual results may differ significantly from the estimates used 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates will be recorded in the period in which the facts that necessitate a revision become known 
although there are a number of areas where we use estimates  what we believe to be the most significant ones are discussed below 
property and equipment 
depreciation on our property and equipment is provided using the straight line method based on the estimated useful life of each facility  which ranges from three to years 
useful lives are determined based on the shorter of our estimate of the life of the equipment or our estimate of the reserves serviced by the equipment 
among other factors  the estimates consider our experience with similar assets and technical analysis of the reserves 
the cost of acquired gas purchase contracts is amortized using the straight line method or units of production 
if the actual lives of the equipment or the reserves serviced by the equipment were less than we originally estimated  we may be required to record a loss upon retirement of a specific asset 
oil and gas reserves  properties and equipment 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 
producing properties and related equipment are depleted and depreciated by the units of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the units of production method is sensitive to the determination of proved reserves 
to the extent the reserves are modified  the depletion determined under the units of production method will be increased or decreased on a prospective basis 
our reserve estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves  the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of these estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
reserve estimates are imprecise and should be expected to change as additional information becomes available 
estimates of economically recoverable reserves and of future net cash flows prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
results of subsequent drilling  testing and production may cause either upward or downward revisions of previous estimates 
in addition  the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of those reserves are based upon certain assumptions about production levels  prices and costs  which may not be correct 
further  the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices and operating costs 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
actual results may differ materially from the results estimated 
asset retirement obligations 
we use significant judgment in estimating our future liability for asset retirement 
we evaluate each asset and in some cases individual components of assets to determine and estimate the future cost and timing of retiring those assets 
the estimate of the future cost is then discounted back to the present and recorded as a liability 
this liability will vary based upon the probability  timing and the extent of remediation necessary to reclaim those facilities  the discount factor used in those determinations and the projected costs of the remediation 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and modify our assumptions as appropriate 
impairment of long lived assets 
if changes in the expected performance of an asset occur  or if overall economic conditions warrant  we will review our assets to determine their economic viability 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  assets are to be evaluated at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
accordingly  our review is completed at the plant facility  the related group of plant facilities or the oil and gas producing field or producing coal seam level 
in order to determine whether an impairment exists  we compare the net book value of the asset to the estimated fair market value or the undiscounted expected future net cash flows  determined by applying future prices estimated by management over the shorter of the lives of the facilities or the associated reserves 
if an impairment exists  write downs of assets are based upon expected future net cash flows discounted using an interest rate commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying asset 
this analysis is sensitive to  among other things  management s expectation of commodity prices  operating costs  drilling plans  production rates and the evaluation in determining asset groupings for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted a review of our oil and gas producing properties  which included an evaluation of the geologic formations and production history for these properties 
this review indicated that the cash flows from individual wells in our operating areas were not largely independent of the cash flows of other wells producing in the same field or coal seam 
as a result of this review  we redefined the asset groupings to a field wide analysis for impairment for the jonah  pinedale and sand wash basins and to a grouping of all wells drilled into related coal seams for the powder river basin 
these asset groupings were used to determine if any impairment was necessary for the year ended december  and it was determined that none of these asset groups were impaired 
in addition  while we did not recognize any impairment of our producing properties in the years ended december  or under the asset groupings utilized in those years  a reevaluation of those years using our new asset groups also did not result in an impairment of our producing properties 
identification of derivatives and mark to market valuations 
the determination of which contractual instruments meet the definition of a derivative under accounting rules is subject to differing interpretations as is the valuation of those derivatives 
management uses its judgment to analyze all contracts to determine whether or not they qualify as derivatives and to determine their value 
a specific area in which management s judgment is required includes identifying contracts meeting the criteria for exclusions from derivatives treatment  market liquidity  and market valuation 
this analysis is sensitive to commodity prices  outside market factors and management s intent upon entering into these contracts 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
we continually monitor and revise our accounting policies as new rules are issued 
at this time  there are several new accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued  but not yet adopted  which will have an impact on our accounting when these rules become effective in the following pronouncements have been issued but not yet adopted 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets were issued in june and became effective for us on july  and january  sfas no 
requires companies to disaggregate and report separately from goodwill certain intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized  but rather are reviewed annually for impairment 
one interpretation being considered relative to these standards is that oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds should be classified separately from oil and gas properties  as intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  the disclosures required by sfas no 
and no 
relative to intangibles would be included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
historically  we have included these oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves as part of the oil and gas properties and equipment  even after sfas no 
and no 
became effective 
this interpretation of sfas no 
and no 
described above would only affect the consolidated balance sheet classification of oil and gas leaseholds 
our results of operations and cash flows would not be affected  since these oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves would continue to be amortized in accordance with accounting rules for oil and gas companies provided in sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
at december   we had undeveloped leaseholds of million that would be classified on the consolidated balance sheet as intangible undeveloped leaseholds and developed leaseholds of million that would be classified as intangible developed leaseholds if the interpretation currently being considered was applied 
we will continue to classify our oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual rights representing the right to extract such reserves as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided 
fin in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity  or vie  and determine when the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
fin also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders in a vie 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for all vies created after january  for vies created before february   the provisions of fin  as amended  must be adopted at the beginning of the first quarter of we did not create any vies after january  and we are continuing to evaluate the impact of fin on any vies created prior to that date and will adopt this pronouncement as required 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under our financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of debt and equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet our needs and finance the growth of our business 
we can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and we may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources 
product prices  hedges of equity production  sales of inventory  the volumes of natural gas processed by our facilities  the volume of natural gas produced from our producing properties  the margin on third party product purchased for resale  as well as the timely collection of our receivables are all expected to have significant influences on our future net cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  our future growth will be dependent upon obtaining additions to dedicated plant reserves  acquisitions  new project development  marketing results  efficient operation of our facilities and our ability to obtain financing at favorable terms 
during the past several years  we have been successful in developing additional reserves of natural gas and increasing our equity natural gas production 
however  the overall level of drilling and production associated with our producing properties will depend upon  among other factors  the price for gas  availability of transportation capacity to market centers  the energy and environmental policy and regulation by governmental agencies  and the issuance of drilling and water disposal permits  none of which is entirely within our control 
any reduction in the levels of exploration  development and production by us or a significant reduction in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
although some of our plants have experienced natural declines in dedicated reserves  overall we have been successful in connecting additional reserves to more than offset these declines 
however  the overall level of drilling associated with our plant facilities will depend upon  among other factors  the prices for oil and gas  the drilling budgets of third party producers  availability of transportation capacity to market centers  the energy and environmental policy and regulation by governmental agencies  the pace at which drilling permits are received  and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which is within our control 
there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in replacing the dedicated reserves processed at our facilities 
any prolonged reduction in prices for natural gas and ngls may depress the levels of exploration  development and production by third parties 
lower levels of these activities could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our gathering  processing and treating services 
a reduction in any of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with net cash provided by operating activities  will provide us with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain our existing facilities and complete our current capital expenditure program 
depending on the timing and the amount of our future projects  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
our ability to secure such capital is restricted by our financing facilities  although we may request additional borrowing capacity from our lenders  seek waivers from our lenders to permit us to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement financing facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for acquisitions  sell existing assets or may use a combination of alternatives 
while we believe that we would be able to secure additional financing  if required  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so or as to the terms of any additional financing 
during  we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility and utilized a portion of that facility to fund million in scheduled payments on the master shelf agreement discussed below 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet scheduled principal repayments during of million under the master shelf agreement and our projected preferred stock dividend requirements during we have effective shelf registration statements filed with the sec for an aggregate of million of debt securities and preferred stock  along with the shares of common stock  if any  into which those securities are convertible  and million of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
these shelf registrations allow us to access the debt and equity markets 
preferred stock redemption 
during the fourth quarter of  we issued two notices of redemption for a total of  shares of our cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the holders of these shares had the right to convert them into shares of our common stock in lieu of receiving the redemption price in cash 
in total  we issued an additional  shares of common stock and paid million in cash proceeds to complete these redemptions 
after completing these redemptions  we have a total of  shares of our cumulative convertible preferred stock outstanding and  assuming no further redemption  we would anticipate paying in a total of million in preferred dividends

we currently anticipate capital expenditures in of approximately million 
the capital budget is a increase over the amount expended in this increase is the result of an expected increase in drilling activity in each of our upstream areas and additional drilling activity by third party producers whose acreage is dedicated to our midstream facilities 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin cbm development and in southwest wyoming operations represent and  respectively  of the total budget 
due to drilling and regulatory uncertainties that are beyond our control  we can make no assurance that our capital budget for will not change 
this budget may be increased to provide for acquisitions if approved by our board of directors 
the capital budget and our capital expenditures during the year ended december   which totaled approximately million  are presented in the following table dollars in thousands 
type of capital expenditure amount expended during the year ended december  capital budget gathering  processing  treating and pipeline assets exploration and production and lease acquisition activities acquisition of gathering systems  which closed in february acquisition of all the capital stock of a private corporation which closed in august information technology and other items capitalized interest and overhead total includes million and million in and  respectively  for maintaining existing facilities 
contractual commitments and obligations contractual cash obligations 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  is as follows dollars in thousands payments by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in due thereafter guarantee of fort union project financing   operating leases      firm transportation capacity and gathering agreements   firm storage capacity agreements     long term debt      total contractual cash obligations    guarantee of fort union project financing 
we own a equity interest in fort union gas gathering  llc  or fort union  and are the construction manager and field operator 
fort union gathers and treats natural gas in the powder river basin in northeast wyoming 
initial construction and any expansions of the gathering header and treating system have been project financed by fort union 
this debt is amortizing on an annual basis and is scheduled to be fully paid in all participants in fort union have guaranteed fort union s payment of the project financing on a proportional basis  resulting in our guarantee of million of the debt of fort union at december  our requirement to fund under this guarantee would be reduced by the value of assets held by fort union 
this guarantee is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
operating leases 
in the ordinary course of our business operations  we enter into operating leases for office space  office equipment  communication equipment and transportation equipment 
in addition  we have entered into operating leases for compression equipment 
payments made on these leases are a component of operating expenses and are reflected on the consolidated statement of operations and  as operating leases  are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
these leases have terms ranging from one month to ten years with return or fair market purchase options available at various times during the lease 
if we were to exercise the purchase options on all the leased equipment  these purchase options would require the capital expenditure of approximately million between and firm transportation capacity and gathering agreements 
access to firm transportation is also a significant element of our business strategy 
firm transportation ensures that our equity production has access to downstream markets and allows us to capture incremental profit when pricing differentials between physical locations occur 
as of december   we had contracts for approximately mmcf per day of firm transportation 
this amount represents our total contracted amount on many individual pipelines 
in many cases it is necessary to utilize sequential pipelines to deliver gas into a specific sales market 
in total  we have the capacity to transport mmcf per day of gas from the rocky mountain area to the mid continent 
this utilizes a total of approximately mmcf per day of firm capacity on three separate pipelines 
the total rate under these long term contracts to transport this gas to the mid continent from the southern powder river basin approximates per mcf 
our remaining firm capacity consists of mmcf per day to markets within the rocky mountains and mmcf per day contracted in various other markets throughout the country 
in addition  we hold mmcf per day of firm gathering capacity on the fort union gathering line 
these agreements are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of this firm transportation capacity was contracted for use in our marketing operations 
for example  our marketing segment purchases gas in the rocky mountain region  transports this gas utilizing its mmcf per day of our firm transportation capacity to the mid continent  and resells the gas to various markets 
during the year ended december   these types of transactions have been profitable as the price difference  or basis  between the rocky mountain and mid continent regions has exceeded the cost of transportation 
the fixed fees associated with our existing contracts for firm transportation capacity during will average approximately per mcf per day 
the associated contract periods range from one month to fourteen years 
under firm transportation contracts  we are required to pay the fees associated with these contracts whether or not the transportation is used 
firm storage capacity agreements 
we customarily store gas in underground storage facilities to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and to capture seasonal price differentials 
as of december   we had contracts in place for approximately bcf of storage capacity at various third party facilities 
of the total storage capacity under contract  approximately bcf is under contract to our canadian subsidiary  wgr canada  inc  and western guarantees the subsidiary s performance under these contracts 
this subsidiary is wholly owned by us and fully consolidated in our financial statements 
the fees associated with these contracts in will average per mcf of annual capacity 
the associated contract periods at december  have an average term of twenty nine months 
at december   we held gas in our contracted storage facilities and in imbalances of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  these positions are for storage withdrawals within the next twelve months 
at the time we place product into storage  we contract for the sale of that product  physically or financially  and do not speculate on the future value of the product 
these agreements for storage capacity are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
from time to time  we lease ngl storage space at major trading locations to facilitate the distribution of products 
at december   we held ngls in storage at various third party facilities of  mgal  consisting primarily of propane and ethane  at an average cost of per gallon compared to  mgal at an average cost of per gallon at december  these agreements for storage capacity are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
long term debt revolving credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding under our existing four year  million revolving credit facility 
this facility matures in april loans made under this facility are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of our significant subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries also guarantee the borrowings under the facility 
the facility contains a provision that requires us to secure loans under the facility with of our oil and gas reserves 
this provision would only be triggered in the event of a reduction to a debt rating on the revolving credit facility of ba or lower by moody s investors service  inc  or moody s  or the reduction to a debt rating on the revolving credit facility of bb or lower by standard poor s rating services  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc  or s p 
this facility has been rated ba by moody s and bb by s p 
the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at eurodollar rates or a base rate  as requested by us  plus an applicable percentage based on our debt to capitalization ratio 
the base rate is the agent s published prime rate 
we also pay a quarterly facility fee ranging between and  depending on our debt to capitalization ratio 
this fee is paid on the total commitment 
at december   the interest rate payable on borrowings under this facility was approximately 
under the credit facility  we are subject to a number of covenants  including maintaining a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than  maintaining a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than  and maintaining a ratio of ebitda  as defined in the credit facility  to interest and dividends on preferred stock over the last four quarters in excess of to  increasing to to at march  and to to at march  the credit facility ranks equally with borrowings under our master shelf agreement with the prudential insurance company 
master shelf agreement 
amounts outstanding under the master shelf agreement with the prudential insurance company of america at december  are as indicated in the following table dollars in thousands issue date amount interest rate final maturity principal payment schedule october   october  single payment at maturity july   july   on each of july  through january   january  single payment at maturity our borrowings under the master shelf agreement are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of our significant subsidiaries  some of which have also provided a guaranty of payments we owe under the facility 
the master shelf requires us to secure loans under the facility with of our oil and gas reserves 
this provision would only be triggered in the event of a reduction to the debt rating on the revolving credit facility of ba or lower by moody s or the reduction to the debt rating on the revolving credit facility of bb or lower by s p 
under our master shelf agreement  we are subject to a number of covenants  including maintaining a minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of million plus of consolidated net earnings earned from january  plus of the net proceeds of any equity offerings after january   maintaining a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than  maintaining a quarterly test of ebitda  as defined in the master shelf agreement  to interest for the last four quarters in excess of to  increasing to to at march  and to to at march   and maintaining a ratio of senior debt to ebitda of no greater than to in the fourth quarter of  we utilized funds available under the revolving credit facility to fund million in scheduled payments under the master shelf agreement  and in we will make scheduled payments totaling million on this facility 
we intend to fund these repayments with funds available under the revolving credit facility 
senior subordinated notes 
in  we sold million of senior subordinated notes in a private placement with a final maturity of due in a single payment which were subsequently exchanged for registered publicly tradable notes under the same terms and conditions 
the subordinated notes bear interest at per annum and were priced at to yield 
these notes contain covenants  which include limitations on debt incurrence  restricted payments  liens and sales of assets 
the subordinated notes are unsecured and are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by our material subsidiaries 
we incurred approximately million in offering commissions and expenses  which were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the notes 
the senior subordinated notes are callable at our option  in whole or in part  at of par value beginning in june and are callable at decreasing premiums thereafter 
our ability to call these notes may be restricted by the covenants under our other debt facilities 
covenant compliance 
we were in compliance with all covenants in our debt agreements at december  environmental the construction and operation of our gathering systems  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  processing  treating or transporting of gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at our facilities or at facilities to which we send wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or waste management 
we employ specialists in environmental engineering  safety and regulatory compliance to monitor environmental and safety compliance at our facilities 
in addition  on an ongoing basis  our environmental engineers perform environmental assessments of our existing facilities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  constructing and operating our facilities 
the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have not had and  we believe  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
prior to consummating any major acquisition  our environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
in conducting this audit on the gathering systems we acquired in february  we identified many well sites that include underground sump tanks  pits  or tinhorns that are not properly permitted according to wyoming oil and gas conservation commission  or wyogcc  regulations 
we have reported these violations to wyogcc and have provided our remediation plan to them 
all of the underground facilities that were out of compliance have been removed and in addition  all but three of the sites have been completely remediated 
these remaining three sites are currently under going remediation according to the plan approved by the wyogcc 
the seller of these assets established a million escrow account to cover the costs of remediation 
to date  actual expenditures have been less than million  and we believe that total remediation costs will be less than the escrow amount 
the texas council on environmental quality  which has authority to regulate  among other things  stationary air emissions sources  has created a committee to make recommendations to it regarding a voluntary emissions reduction plan for the permitting of existing grand fathered air emissions sources within texas 
a grand fathered air emissions source is one that does not need a state operating permit because it was constructed prior to we operate a number of these sources within texas  including portions of our midkiff benedum  gomez and mitchell puckett systems 
in connection with a modernization program  which was completed in march  we replaced the majority of our grand fathered equipment in texas 
we believe that the potential cost of complying with these regulations for our remaining grand fathered equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we anticipate that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be toward stricter standards 
federal regulations regarding spill prevention and containment have recently been modified to establish a lower threshold of storage capacity of petroleum and petroleum by products at a site for which a spill prevention plan is required 
we are evaluating all of our assets for compliance with this regulation and estimate that approximately existing sites will need to be modified to meet the new requirements 
we currently estimate our costs for compliance to be approximately million 
the new spill prevention plans must be in place for covered assets by august all modifications called for by those plans must be in place by february we are in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at certain facilities that we operate 
our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been significant in relation to our results of operations and totaled approximately million for the year ended december   including approximately  in air emissions fees to the states in which we operate 
although we anticipate that such environmental expenses per facility will increase over time  we do not believe that such increases will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of our equity volumes of gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow and net income in relation to those anticipated by our operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to our marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to fixed price purchase and sale commitments  the value of storage inventories and exposure to physical market price volatility 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter  or otc  market to accomplish these goals 
these instruments allow us to preserve value and protect margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments offset gains or losses in the physical market 
we also use financial instruments to reduce basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
we enter into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  and through otc swaps and options with various counterparties  consisting primarily of investment banks  financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
we conduct credit reviews of all of our otc counterparties and have agreements with many of these parties that contain collateral requirements 
we generally use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative otc exposures 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
our exposure to otc credit risk is reduced by our ability to require a margin deposit from our counterparties based upon the mark to market value of their net exposure 
we are also subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements and under margin deposit requirements for our nymex transactions 
at december   we had million of margin deposits outstanding 
we continually monitor and review the credit exposure to our marketing counterparties 
in order to minimize our credit exposures  we have utilized existing netting agreements to reduce our net credit exposure  established new netting agreements with additional customers  terminated several long term marketing obligations  negotiated accelerated payment terms with several customers  and reduced the amount of credit which we make available to various customers 
although netting agreements similar to those that we utilize have been upheld by bankruptcy courts in the past  if any of these customers with whom we have netting agreements were to file for bankruptcy  we can provide no assurance that our agreements will not be challenged or as to the outcome of any challenge 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including instances when i our equity volumes are less than expected  ii our customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii our otc counterparties fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in these prices 
risk policy and control 
we control the extent of risk management and marketing activities through policies and procedures that involve the senior level of management 
on a daily basis  our marketing activities are audited and monitored by our independent risk oversight department  or iro 
this department reports to the chief financial officer  thereby providing a separation of duties from the marketing department 
additionally  the iro reports monthly to the risk management committee  or rmc 
this committee is comprised of corporate managers and officers and is responsible for developing the policies and guidelines that control the management and measurement of risk 
the rmc is also responsible for setting risk limits including value at risk and dollar stop loss limits 
our board of directors approves the risk limit parameters and risk management policy 
hedge positions 
as of january   we have hedged approximately of our projected equity natural gas volumes and approximately of our estimated equity production of crude oil  condensate  and ngls 
all of these contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as such  gains and losses related to the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
realized gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through product purchases when the hedged transactions occur 
to qualify as cash flow hedges  the hedge instruments must be designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value must be highly correlated with changes in the price of the forecasted transaction being hedged so that our exposure to the risk of commodity price changes is reduced 
to meet this requirement  we hedge the price of the commodity and  if applicable  the basis between that derivative s contract delivery location and the cash market location used for the actual sale of the product 
this structure attains a high level of effectiveness  insuring that a change in the price of the forecasted transaction will result in an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the hedged commodity 
we utilize crude oil as a surrogate hedge for natural gasoline  butane and condensate 
our hedges are tested for effectiveness at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter 
we use regression analysis based on a five year period of time for this test 
based on the results of the regression analysis  these hedges are expected to continue to be highly effective under sfas no 
in the future 
gains or losses from the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized currently in earnings through price risk management activities 
during the year ended december   we recognized a loss of  from the ineffective portions of our hedges 
outstanding equity hedge positions and the associated basis for the following table details our hedge positions as of january  in order to determine the hedged price to the particular operating region  deduct the basis differential from the nymex price 
the prices for ngls do not include the cost of the hedges of approximately million

based on prices as of december   approximately million of losses in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in value at risk 
we measure market risk in our natural gas and liquid marketing portfolios using value at risk  or var 
we define var as a measure of the maximum expected loss over a given horizon under normal market conditions 
var does not explicitly indicate potential realized losses 
var does  however  implicitly indicate a firm s potential realized loss if market conditions were to remain constant or if the portfolio is liquidated within the specified time period 
our calculations are derived from financial engineering association s var works using the variance co variance method 
we assume a one day holding period with a confidence level 
there is a out of business days chance that the portfolio loss will be less than a specified amount if the entire portfolio were liquidated the next day 
as of december   our var position for natural gas and ngl marketing portfolios was  and the average for all of was  this figure includes the risk related to our entire marketing portfolio of natural gas and ngl financial instruments and the related underlying physical transactions 
we also measure market risk by sensitivity valuations 
as of december   an increase in natural gas prices of per mmbtu would lead to an increase in the fair value of our marketing portfolio of  and an increase in crude oil prices of per barrel would lead to an increase in the fair value of our marketing portfolio of  to the extent that a transaction is not fully hedged or there is any hedge ineffectiveness  additional gains or losses associated with the transaction may be reported in future periods

foreign currency derivative market risk 
as a normal part of our business  we enter into physical gas transactions which are payable in canadian dollars 
we enter into forward purchases and sales of canadian dollars from time to time to fix the cost of our future canadian dollar denominated natural gas purchase  sale  storage  and transportation obligations 
this is done to protect marketing margins from adverse changes in the us and canadian dollar exchange rate between the time the commitment for the payment obligation is made and the actual payment date of such obligation 
as of december   the net notional value of such contracts was approximately million in canadian dollars  which approximates fair market value
