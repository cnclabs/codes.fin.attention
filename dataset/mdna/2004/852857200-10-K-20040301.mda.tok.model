overview stamps 
com is the leading provider of internet based postage solutions 
stamps 
com s service allows customers to buy and print usps approved postage using a pc  an ordinary inkjet or laser printer and an internet connection 
customers use our service to mail and ship a variety of mail pieces including postcards  envelopes  flats and packages using a wide range of mail classes 
our customers include home businesses  small businesses  corporations  shippers and individuals 
stamps 
com was approved by the usps as a licensed vendor to offer pc postage in august and launched our service in october during  we continued to execute our restructuring strategy to decrease our operating losses and enhance our ability to achieve profitability by reducing the total number of employees by approximately to employees in february and by an additional to approximately employees in august we also sold the iship multi carrier shipping service assets to united parcel service for million in may with the restructuring completed  we spent the majority of improving our service offering by adding two significant new product features 
on july  we launched netstamps 
customers print netstamps on blank label stock containing labels per page 
netstamps can be printed for any amount and used with any mail piece 
netstamps do not have a mailing date and do not contain a destination address and thus can be used like regular postage stamps 
we believe netstamps increased the value of our service by meeting more of our customers mailing and shipping needs 
one of the more significant results of the netstamps launch is the incremental revenue generated by the sale of the associated special label stock 
each netstamps sheet contains labels and is sold in packs of and sheets 
we have experience strong netstamps label sales since launch in july of in the third and fourth quarters of  sales were approximately  and  respectively 
during the four quarters ended december   sales of these labels were approximately    and  respectively 
on november  we launched our plain paper shipping feature within version of our client software 
this version of our software was designed to enhance shipping functionality  including the ability to print a shipping label with electronic delivery confirmation 
customers are now able to print a shipping label on a plain piece of by printer paper 
this eliminates the need to use part labels and reduces the risk of misprinted postage 
using our new plain paper shipping label allows customers to receive free electronic delivery confirmation with priority mail 
prior to this technology  the usps required separate confirmation labels that added an additional step to the process  and an additional cost of 
per package 
electronic signature confirmation and electronic delivery confirmation on other mail classes are also available at discounted rates with a 
savings per package 
customers may also track their packages within our software with an easy one click status check  thus eliminating the need to key in a long tracking number 
during  we continued to focus on improving our core product software features and launched new products to generate incremental revenue from our customer base 
on january   we announced the launch of our first specialty netstamps tm labels called love netstamps 
specialty netstamps labels contain new images and improved designs compared with our original netstamps labels 
specialty netstamps were further expanded with the launch of liberty netstamps and holiday netstamps in june and november  respectively 
also in january  we successfully implemented a new process called instant access  which enables our new customers to immediately begin printing postage after registration for the service  a dramatic improvement over the previous process that required two to hours of wait time 

table of contents on april   we launched the first of many new product features with the release of our new shipping capability called hidden postage 
this new feature enhances our service  resulting in a more powerful shipping solution for businesses  e commerce sites and online auctioneers 
hidden postage allows the customers to print a shipping label without printing the actual value of the postage on the label 
by hiding the postage amount of the shipment  businesses can more easily cover their full shipping and handling costs without causing customer complaints 
on october  we launched version of our client software  which provided enhanced integration with microsoft office system  our stamps 
com package insurance  broader support for shipping and an expanded online store platform 
we worked in collaboration with microsoft to improve integration with microsoft word and outlook 
the enhanced integration allows users to add postage to an envelope or a mail merge without leaving the familiar microsoft office environment 
our insurance offering allows users to insure their packages in a fully integrated  online process that eliminates any trips to the post office or the need to complete any forms 
further  customers on select plans currently receive a discount over usps insurance rates 
other shipping improvements include the ability to send shipment notification emails with a tracking link  the ability to print shipping labels for express mail and bound printed matter  and support for additional usps services such as collect on delivery cod 
finally  we expanded and redesigned our online store in order to support a larger selection of items 
we made available for sale new labels for use with our internet postage and shipping labels features 
in october  we completed a study to understand the status of our net operation losses nol or nols 
based on that study  we believe that we have not undergone an internal revenue code irc section change of control that would trigger an impairment of the use of our nols since our secondary offering in december under the complicated irc section rules  a change in ownership can occur whenever there is a shift in ownership by more than percentage points by one or more five percent shareholders within a three year period 
when a change of ownership is triggered  the nols may be impaired 
as of december  we estimate that we are currently below the level that would trigger impairment of our nol asset 
therefore  we request that all of our investors contact us prior to allowing their respective ownership interest to reach a five percent level 
in december  we reached a settlement in all patent infringement litigation with pitney bowes 
the settlement included a five year patent cross licensing agreement 
in addition  there will be no material financial payment between the companies 
for further discussion  please refer to the legal proceedings section of this report 
on january  our board of directors declared a one time return of capital cash dividend of per share  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february   which dividend was paid on february  based on the number of common shares outstanding as of february   the total amount of the dividend was approximately million 
in addition  our board of directors also has authorized a reverse stock split of our common stock  subject to shareholder approval 
at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on april   shareholder of stamps 
com will be asked to grant the board of directors the authority to select the exact exchange ratio of either one for two  one for three or one for four  with the exact ratio to be determined by our board of directors at the time it elects to effect a split 
the par value of our common stock would remain unchanged at per share  and the number of authorized shares of common stock and preferred stock would be reduced proportionately  by the reverse split ratio  from  and  respectively

following this exercise  we identified approximately  customers who we deemed as hopelessly uncollectible based on the most recent credit card decline codes we were receiving from our new payment processor

sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value

this standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount

in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirement of sfas no

critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to patents  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring 
we have recorded reserves in connection with our restructuring programs 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
patents and intangibles 
we make estimates of the estimated useful lives of our patents and other amortizable intangibles 
these estimates are made using various assumptions that could change as economic and 
table of contents competitive conditions change 
if events were to occur that would cause our assumptions to change  the amounts recorded as amortization would be adjusted 
contingencies and litigation 
we are involved in various litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant and we record any amount recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and estimatable 
any amounts recorded would be based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management 
actual results may differ from estimates 
see note of notes to financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and investments are comprised of money market  us government obligations and public corporate debt securities with weighted average maturities of less than days at december  our cash equivalents and investments  net of restricted cash  approximated million and had a related weighted average interest rate of 
interest rate fluctuations impact the carrying value of the portfolio 
we do not believe that the future market risks related to the above securities will have material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity
