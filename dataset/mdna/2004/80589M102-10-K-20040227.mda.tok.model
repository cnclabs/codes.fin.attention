electric operations the electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of sce g  genco and fuel company  and is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity in south carolina 
at december  sce g provided electricity to over  customers in an area of approximately  square miles 
genco owns and operates a coal fired generating station and sells electricity solely to sce g 
fuel company acquires  owns and provides financing for sce g s nuclear fuel  fossil fuel and sulfur dioxide emission allowance requirements 
operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity  which is currently 
demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather  customer growth and the economy 
in addition  significant legislative and regulatory matters could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment 
in south carolina the state legislature is not actively pursuing electric restructuring 
however  both houses of the us congress passed energy legislation in  with the house of representatives passing an energy conference report 
the senate failed to pass the conference report due to its inability to reach a compromise on certain key issues unrelated to utilities 
if a compromise is reached in  such legislation is expected to contain provisions that would repeal puhca and transfer additional regulatory authority to ferc 
this legislation may also impose stringent requirements on retail electric suppliers to generate electricity from renewable energy resources  which sources may or may not include hydroelectric generation 
in addition  largely in response to the august blackout in eight northern states and parts of canada  the energy legislation would likely include provisions to develop and enforce reliability standards for high voltage transmission systems and to expedite construction of transmission lines 
the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted  and if it is  the conditions it would impose on utilities 
if the energy legislation stalls in  or if it fails to address certain issues  ferc is expected to proceed with regulatory initiatives that would significantly change the country s existing regulatory framework governing transmission  open access and energy markets and would attempt  in large measure  to standardize the national energy market 
in july ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on standard market design smd which ferc supplemented with the issuance of a white paper in april if implemented  the proposed rule could have a significant impact on sce g s access to or cost of power for its native load customers and on sce g s marketing of power outside its service territory 
the company is currently evaluating ferc s action to determine potential effects on sce g s operations 
additional directives from ferc are expected  and would likely be significantly influenced by the energy legislation discussed in the preceding paragraph 
the north american electric reliability council nerc is comprised of utilities and other market participants who voluntarily develop and comply with nerc policies and standards which govern the planning and operation of the nation s interconnected bulk power system the grid 
currently these policies and standards are enforceable only through voluntary compliance by nerc members 
since the august blackout  and in response to issues identified during investigation of the blackout  nerc has been developing additional reliability standards  policies  and procedures 
nerc is working with the regions and utilities in north america to strengthen existing enforcement and compliance programs  and is seeking to develop contracts between the regions and utility members to require compliance with these standards 
nerc is also actively pursuing federal legislation to provide it with the authority to enforce reliability standards on all market participants  not just utilities 
sce g continues to work with nerc and directly with other utilities to develop additional reliability policies and standards and continues to comply with nerc s existing policies and standards 
gas distribution the gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of sce g and psnc energy  and is primarily engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of north carolina and south carolina 
at december  this segment provided natural gas to more than  customers in an area of approximately  square miles 
operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity  which is currently for sce g and for psnc energy 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather  customer growth  the economy and  for commercial and industrial customers  the availability and price of alternate fuels 
natural gas competes with electricity  propane and heating oil to serve the heating and  to a lesser extent  other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers 
this competition is generally based on price and convenience 
large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel  such as propane or fuel oil 
natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price 
as a result  any significant disparity between supply and demand  either of natural gas or of alternate fuels  and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors  will affect price and impact the company s ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers 
gas transmission the gas transmission segment is comprised of scpc 
scpc is engaged in the purchase  transmission and sale of natural gas on a wholesale basis to distribution companies including sce g and directly to industrial customers throughout most of south carolina 
operating results for gas transmission are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas  the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers 
embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity  which for scpc is currently to 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
scpc supplies natural gas to sce g for its resale to gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs 
scpc also sells natural gas to large commercial and industrial customers in south carolina and faces the same competitive pressures as the gas distribution segment for these classes of customers 
retail gas marketing scana energy  a division of semi  comprises the retail gas marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas to over  customers throughout georgia 
scana energy s competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in georgia s energy market as well as several electric membership cooperatives 
scana s ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors  its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors 
in addition  the pipeline capacity available for scana energy to serve industrial and other customers is tied to the market share held by scana energy in the retail market 
in december scana energy signed a definitive agreement with another marketer to acquire the approximately  retail natural gas customers being served by that marketer in georgia 
the purchase  which is subject to customary closing conditions  was approved by the gpsc in january and is expected to be completed in march with this transaction  scana energy s total customer base will represent about a percent share of the million customers in georgia s natural gas market 
scana energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state 
in scana energy was selected by the gpsc to serve as georgia s regulated provider for a two year period 
in this capacity  scana energy serves low income customers at a rate subsidized by georgia s universal service fund  and extends service to high credit risk customers who have been denied service by other marketers 
at december  scana energy s regulated division served over  customers 
in the gpsc may extend scana energy s term for an additional year beginning september or may conduct another bidding process  in which scana energy may participate  to select a regulated provider for a new term 
in july the gpsc approved a joint stipulation between the gpsc staff  atlanta gas light company agl and natural gas marketers excluding scana energy 
the joint stipulation  among other things  reduces the frequency whereby agl can recall capacity previously released to the various gas marketers and streamlines certain gas balancing processes 
though scana energy believes the joint stipulation will improve operations for itself and the other gas marketers  scana energy continues to advocate an alternate plan it proposed that would assign interstate asset capacity to those gas marketers choosing assignment and approved by the gpsc 
the gpsc filed a request with ferc to obtain a declaratory order on whether ferc regulation would preempt or have jurisdiction over scana energy s proposal 
comments were due to ferc by december  it is uncertain how long it will take for ferc to issue an order 
however  once an order is issued the gpsc will determine what action  if any  the gpsc should take on scana energy s proposal 
scana energy and scana s other natural gas distribution  transmission and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments  including futures contracts and options  to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  at any given time  a portion of scana s projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
since scana energy operates in a competitive market  it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
energy marketing the divisions of semi  excluding scana energy  comprise the energy marketing segment 
this segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to producers and customers 
the operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs 
demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth 
results of operations the company s reported earnings loss are prepared in accordance with gaap 
management believes that  in addition to reported earnings loss under gaap  the gaap adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of the company s fundamental earnings power and period over period financial performance 
a reconciliation of reported gaap earnings loss per share to gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share is provided in the table below earnings loss and dividends reported gaap earnings loss per share and gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share of common stock and cash dividends declared for  and were as follows reported gaap earnings loss per share less gains from sales of investments and assets 

investment impairments 

cumulative effect of accounting change  net of taxes gaap adjusted net earnings from operations per share cash dividends declared per share o vs gaap adjusted net earnings from operations increased 
primarily due to higher electric margins of  higher gas margins of

pension income pension income was recorded on the company s financial statements as follows millions of dollars income statement impact component of reduction in employee benefit costs other income balance sheet impact component of reduction in capital expenditures component of reduction in amount due to summer station co owner total pension income for the last several years  the market value of the company s retirement plan pension assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits 
however  pension income for decreased significantly compared to and  primarily as a result of a less favorable investment market 
see also the discussion of pension accounting in critical accounting policies 
allowance for funds used during construction afc afc is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress is capitalized 
the company includes an equity portion of afc in nonoperating income and a debt portion of afc in interest charges credits as noncash items  both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income 
afc represented approximately of income before income taxes in  in and in the ratio in was significantly higher than historical norms due to the inclusion in income before income taxes of million of impairments related to the other than temporary decline in market value of the company s investment in dtag and itc deltacom 
the ratio in was lower than historical norms due to the inclusion in income before income taxes of a gain of million on the exchange of the company s investment in powertel for shares of dtag 
in addition to the effect of impairments  the decrease in afc for vs is partially due to the completion of the urquhart station repowering project in june also  in january the scpsc issued an order allowing sce g to include all jasper county generating project expenditures as of december  and other construction work in progress expenditures as of june  in electric rate base 
at the time the expenditures were included in the rate base  afc was no longer calculated on those amounts 
these decreases were partially offset by increased afc from subsequent construction expenditures related to the jasper county generating and lake murray dam projects see discussion at capital projects 
in addition to the effect of impairments in and the gain in  the increase in afc for vs was primarily the result of increased construction expenditures for the urquhart station repowering  jasper county generating and lake murray dam projects

income taxes income taxes increased approximately million in compared to and decreased approximately million in compared to changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in other income described above 
the company s effective tax rate for was approximately  which reflects the impact of the change in tax regulations effective in allowing for the tax deductibility of certain dividends paid on scana stock held in the company s stock purchase savings plan 
the company s effective tax rate has also been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of federal investment tax credits and the recovery of the equity portion of afc 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements for scana s regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs  funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to scana 
the ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas  will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  rate increases will be sought 
the future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief  if requested 
the company s leverage ratio of debt to capital increased significantly in  when scana issued million of long term debt in connection with the purchase of psnc energy 
at december  the leverage ratio was 
the company s goal is to reduce this leverage ratio to between to 
if the agencies rating the company s credit determine that the company will not be able to achieve sufficient improvement in the leverage ratio  these rating agencies may downgrade the company s debt 
such a downgrade would adversely affect the interest rate the company may obtain when issuing debt and would increase the rates applicable to the company s short term commercial paper programs 
in order to bring the leverage ratio in line with rating agency expectations  the company may apply cash flows from operations  sell equity securities  pay down debt with proceeds from the sale of telecommunications investments  or a combination of the three 
in addition  sce g anticipates finishing construction on its jasper county generating station and placing it in commercial operation in mid once the plant is complete  sce g s capital expenditure budget is expected to decline significantly

many of these forward contracts include customary make whole or default provisions  but are not considered to be take or pay contracts 
certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses  therefore  the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates 
also included in other commercial commitments is a year take and pay contract for natural gas beginning in the spring of  estimated obligations for coal supply purchases and certain obligations related to the lake murray dam reinforcement project 
included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so 
the company may terminate such purchase obligations without penalty 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations above  the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees 
the pension plan is adequately funded  with no contributions having been required since no further contributions are anticipated until after cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were approximately million in  and similar payments are expected in the future 
in addition  the company is party to certain nymex futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements through december  are funded in cash 
these derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur 
the company also has nuclear fuel obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations above 
while no specific monetary amount is specified for nuclear fuel contracts  the company s two thirds share of expected cost is million for the year  a total of million for the years  a total of million for the years and a total of million for the years the company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of summer station that is not listed in the contractual cash obligations above 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness 
sales of additional equity securities may also occur 
the company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash outlays for estimated and actual for certain expenditures are as follows millions of dollars property additions and construction expenditures  net of afc nuclear fuel expenditures investments total included in cash outlays are the following specific projects o ferc mandated that sce g s lake murray dam be reinforced to comply with new federal safety standards

financing cash flows during the company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately million primarily due to the reduction of long and short term debt and payment of dividends 
conversely  sce g experienced net cash inflows related to financing activities of approximately million primarily arising from borrowings in support of sce g s construction program and for general corporate purposes 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
these swap agreements provide for the company to pay variable and receive fixed rate interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of certain debt instruments 
the company may terminate a swap agreement and may replace it with a new swap also designated as a fair value hedge 
payments received upon termination of such swaps are recorded as basis adjustments to long term debt and are amortized as reductions to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt 
at december  the estimated fair value of the company s swaps totaled million gain related to combined notional amounts of million 
in anticipation of the issuance of debt  the company may use interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk 
payments received or made upon termination of such agreements are recorded within other deferred debits or credits on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt 
in connection with the issuance of first mortgage bonds in may  the company paid approximately million upon the termination of a treasury lock agreement 
in connection with the issuance of first mortgage bonds in december  the company paid approximately million upon the termination of a forward starting interest rate swap 
on february  genco issued million of senior secured promissory notes maturing february  and bearing a fixed interest rate of 
proceeds from this issuance will be used to support genco s construction program and to repay intercompany advances borrowed for that purpose

the new dividend is payable april  to stockholders of record on march  for additional information on significant financing transactions  see the consolidated statements of capitalization and note to the consolidated financial statements for the company 
environmental matters capital expenditures in the years through  the company s capital expenditures for environmental control totaled approximately million 
these expenditures were in addition to expenditures included in other operation and maintenance expenses  which were approximately million  million  and million during  and  respectively 
it is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters  but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the company are million for and million for the four year period through these expenditures are included in the company s construction program  discussed in liquidity and capital resources and include the matters discussed below 
electric operations the caa required electric utilities to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides nox substantially by the year the company remains in compliance with these requirements 
in the epa required the state of south carolina  among other states  to modify its state implementation plan sip to address the issue of nox pollution 
the state s sip requires additional emissions reductions in and beyond 
further  the epa had indicated that it would finalize regulations by december for stricter limits on mercury and other pollutants generated by coal fired plants 
the epa has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry  and the doj has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the caa 
at least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided one favorable to the industry and one not 
neither is binding as precedent on the company 
prior to the suits  those utilities had received requests for information under section of the caa and were issued notices of violation 
the basis for these suits is the assertion by the epa that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly best available control technology bact 
sce g and genco have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the regulations under the caa provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications  including an exemption for routine repair  replacement or maintenance 
on october  epa published a final revised nsr rule in the federal register with an effective date of december  the new rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the nsr enforcement initiative 
however  on motion of several northeastern states  the united states circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia stayed the effect of the final rule 
the ultimate application of the final rule to the company is uncertain 
the company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the epa s requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair  replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation 
the regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth 
the current state of continued doj enforcement actions is the subject of speculation industry wide  but it is possible that the epa will commence enforcement actions against sce g and genco  and the epa has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to  per day for each violation 
the epa also could seek installation of bact or equivalent at the three plants 
the company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the company s  sce g s or genco s compliance with the caa would be without merit 
however  if successful  such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
to comply with current and anticipated state and federal regulations  sce g and genco expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately million over the period to retrofit existing facilities  with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately million per year 
to meet compliance requirements for the years through  the company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately million 
the clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under this act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all  and renewed for nearly all  of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling thermal discharges and strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company is developing compliance plans for these initiatives 
congress is expected to consider further amendments to the clean water act in such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones  the implementation of technology based standards for main condenser cooling water including intake and discharge structures and toxicity based standards 
these provisions  if passed  could have a material impact on the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company  sce g and genco 
nuclear fuel disposal the nuclear waste policy act of required that the united states government make available by a permanent repository for high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and imposes a fee of mil per kwh of net nuclear generation after april  payments  which began in  are subject to change and will extend through the operating life of sce g s summer station 
sce g entered into a contract with the doe in providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel by the doe 
the doe presently estimates that the permanent storage facility will not be available until sce g has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through spent fuel pool reracking  dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available 
the act also imposes on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available 
on january  sce g and santee cooper one third owner of summer station filed suit in the court of federal claims against the doe for breach of the above contract 
the contract known as the standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and or high level radioactive waste standard contract required the federal government to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste beginning not later than january   in exchange for agreed payments fixed in the standard contract at particular amounts 
as of the date of filing  the federal government has accepted no spent fuel from summer station or any other utility for transport and disposal  and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until  at the earliest 
as a consequence of the federal government s breach of contract  the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs 
there are two additional causes of action alleged as well damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and a takings claim demanding just compensation for the taking of the plaintiffs real property necessitated by the storage 
this lawsuit is one of similar lawsuits brought by nuclear utilities as of january  gas distribution the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates 
deferred amounts for sce g  net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters 
o sce g owns a decommissioned mgp site in the calhoun park area of charleston  south carolina 
the site is currently being remediated for benzene contamination in the intermediate aquifer on surrounding properties 
sce g anticipates that the remaining remediation activities will be completed by the end of  with certain monitoring and other activities continuing until as of december   sce g has spent approximately million to remediate the calhoun park site  and expects to spend an additional million 
o sce g owns three other decommissioned mgp sites in south carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals 
two of these sites are currently being remediated under work plans approved by dhec 
sce g is continuing to investigate the remaining site and is monitoring the nature and extent of residual contamination 
in addition  in march sce g signed a consent agreement with dhec related to a site formerly owned by sce g 
the site contained residue material that was moved from the columbia mgp 
the removal action for this site has been completed 
sce g anticipates that major remediation activities for the three owned sites will be completed before as of december   sce g has spent approximately million related to these three sites  and expects to spend an additional million 
in addition  psnc energy is responsible for environmental cleanup at five sites in north carolina on which mgp residuals are present or suspected 
psnc energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of approximately million  which reflects the estimated remaining liability at december  amounts incurred and deferred to date that are not currently being recovered through gas rates are approximately million 
management believes that all mgp cleanup costs incurred will be recoverable through gas rates 
regulatory matters material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
south carolina electric gas company sce g is subject to the jurisdiction of the scpsc as to retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities other than short term borrowings and other matters 
in conjunction with a january order  the scpsc allowed sce g to include all jasper county generating station project expenditures as of december  and other construction work in progress expenditures as of june  in electric rate base 
once this generating station is complete  sce g may seek to include the remaining project expenditures in its electric rate base 
construction expenditures for the lake murray dam construction project  which totaled approximately million as of december   have not been included in electric rate base 
when the lake murray project is completed in  sce g will determine whether to seek inclusion of such expenditures in electric rate base 
synthetic fuel investments sce g holds two equity method investments in partnerships involved in converting coal to non conventional fuel  the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits 
the aggregate investment in these partnerships as of december  is approximately million  and through december   they have generated and passed through to sce g approximately million in such tax credits 
at december  sce g has recorded on its balance sheet million net deferred fuel tax benefits  which include partnership losses  net of tax 
in addition  primesouth  inc  a non regulated subsidiary of scana  operates a synthetic fuel facility for a third party and receives management fees  royalties and expense reimbursements related to these services 
primesouth does not benefit from any synfuel tax credits 
under a plan approved by the scpsc  any tax credits generated and ultimately passed through to sce g from synfuel produced and consumed by sce g  net of partnership losses and other expenses  have been and will be deferred and will be applied to offset the capital costs of projects required to comply with legislative or regulatory actions 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the irs has completed and closed examinations of the company s consolidated federal income tax returns through its tax year ended in  with the exception of the company s interest in the synthetic fuel partnership  s 
c 
coaltech no 
lp the irs has notified the company that it is in the process of closing this partnership examination with no changes being proposed  and that a formal closing letter is forthcoming 
the irs audit report makes no challenge to the declaration that the synthetic fuel facility was properly placed in service  and takes no issue with evidence submitted demonstrating that the facility produces a qualifying fuel 
on october   the irs issued announcement stating that it had completed a review of chemical change issues associated with tax credits claimed under irc section relating to the production and sale of synthetic fuel 
it further stated that it would resume the issuance of private letter rulings plrs concerning synthetic fuel credits consistent with the guidelines regarding chemical change previously set forth in revenue procedures and and certain additional requirements related to sampling  testing and recordkeeping procedures  even though the irs has indicated that the level of chemical change required under that guidance is not sufficient for irc section purposes 
the irs also stated in the announcement that it would continue to issue plrs because it recognized that many taxpayers and their investors have relied on its long standing ruling practice to make investments 
in announcement issued on june   the irs had questioned the validity of certain test procedures and results that had been presented to it by taxpayers with interests in synfuel operations as evidence that the required significant chemical change had occurred  and had initiated a review of these test procedures and results which was completed as noted in announcement separately  the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the government affairs committee of the united states senate subcommittee is conducting an investigation of potential abuses of tax credits by producers of synthetic fuel under irc section the subcommittee chairman  in a memorandum commencing the investigation  has stated that he anticipates the investigation will focus on whether certain synthetic fuel producers are claiming tax credits even though their product is not a qualified synthetic fuel under section and irs regulations 
the memorandum also states that the investigation will address whether certain corporations are engaging in transactions solely to take advantage of unused section credits with no other business purpose  and the irs efforts to curb abuses related to these credits 
while the effect of these two developments is not clear  the company is aware that plrs have been issued since october  the company has not had any communication with the subcommittee staff  and with the imminent conclusion of the irs audit  the company continues to believe that all of its synthetic fuel tax credits have been properly claimed 
nuclear license extension in august sce g filed an application with the nrc for a year license extension for its summer station 
if approved  the extension would allow the plant to operate into at december  sce g had capitalized approximately million related to the application process and expects to capitalize an additional million in sce g expects the extension to be granted in mid public service company of north carolina  incorporated psnc energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the ncuc as to gas rates  issuance of securities other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less  accounting and other matters

department of transportation dot to establish a pipeline integrity management rule for operations of natural gas transmission pipelines that have moderate to high density population areas within close proximity 
the act requires dot to set stringent regulations on segments of transmission pipeline where leaks or ruptures could threaten people or property 
as a result  psnc energy must inspect and assess the physical reliability of the approximately miles of its transmission line that are covered by the act within the initial ten year deadline established by the act 
depending on the assessment method used  psnc energy will be required to reinspect these same lines every five to seven years after the initial deadline

critical accounting policies following are descriptions of the company s accounting policies which are new or most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations 
utility regulation the company s regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated 
in the future  as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment  the company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company s electric distribution and gas distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded 
it is not expected that cash flows or financial position would be materially affected 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  including those associated with the company s environmental assessment program 
the company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in these assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december  the company s net investments in fossil hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately  million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition and unbilled revenues revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers 
because customers of our utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters  the company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period 
such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters 
such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class  the effects of different rate schedules  changes in weather and  where applicable  the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures 
the accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs 
as of december  and  accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of million and million  respectively  compared to total revenues for and of billion and billion  respectively 
provisions for bad debts and allowances for doubtful accounts as of each balance sheet date  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts  assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts  and consideration of actual write off history 
the distribution segments of the company s regulated utilities have established write off histories and regulated service areas that enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts 
the company s retail gas marketing segment operates in georgia s natural gas market 
as such  estimation of the provision for bad debts related to this segment is subject to greater imprecision 
nuclear decommissioning accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
among the factors that could change sce g s accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology  changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements  and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows 
sce g expects to receive a year license extension for summer station that will significantly impact the eventual cost of and funding for decommissioning 
see also the discussion of the company s adoption of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  below 
changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the company s financial position and cash flows although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral  because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers 
sce g s share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for summer station  including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination  totals approximately million  stated in dollars  based on a decommissioning study completed in santee cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station 
the cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the nrc under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use 
under sce g s method of funding decommissioning costs  funds collected through rates are used to pay premiums on insurance policies on the lives of certain company personnel 
sce g is the beneficiary of these policies 
through these insurance contracts  sce g is able to take advantage of income tax benefits and accrue earnings on the fund on a tax deferred basis 
amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates  insurance proceeds  and interest on proceeds  less expenses  are transferred by sce g to an external trust fund 
management intends for the fund  including earnings thereon  to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits scana follows sfas  employers accounting for pensions  in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan 
scana s plan is fully funded and as such  net pension income is reflected in the financial statements see results of operations 
sfas requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and returns on assets 
net pension income of million recorded in reflects the use of a discount rate and an assumed long term return on plan assets 
scana believes that these assumptions were  and that the resulting pension income amount was  reasonable 
for purposes of comparison  using a discount rate of in would have lowered scana s pension income by approximately million 
had the assumed long term return on assets been reduced to in  scana s pension income would have been reduced by approximately million 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  the company considers the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities 
as such  the company selected the beginning of year discount rate of as being within a reasonable range of interest rates for obligations rated aa by moody s as of january  this same discount rate was also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits opeb costs discussed below 
the following information with respect to pension assets and returns thereon should also be noted the company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluated input from actuaries and from pension fund investment advisors  including such advisors review of the plan s historical  and year cumulative actual returns of  and  respectively  all of which have all been in excess of related broad indices 
the company anticipates that investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 
the expected long term rate of return of is based on a target asset allocation of with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
while investment performance in and the recent decline in discount rate have significantly reduced the level of pension income  the pension trust has been and remains adequately funded  and no contributions have been required since as such  recent declines in pension income have had no impact on the company s cash flows 
based on stress testing performed by the company s actuaries  management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after similar to its pension accounting  scana follows sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits 
this plan is unfunded  so no assumptions related to return on assets impact the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
scana used a discount rate of and recorded a net sfas cost of million for had the selected discount rate been  the expense for would have been approximately million higher 
goodwill in connection with the adoption  effective january   of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performed a valuation analysis of its investment in scpc the company s gas transmission segment using a discounted cash flow analysis and of psnc energy part of the company s gas distribution segment using an independent appraisal 
the analysis for scpc indicated that the fair value of related goodwill exceeded its carrying amount 
the independent appraisal made various assumptions related to psnc energy s cash flow projections  discount rates  weighted average cost of capital and market multiples for comparable companies 
the analysis indicated that the carrying amount of psnc energy s acquisition adjustment goodwill exceeded its fair value  and as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million as the cumulative effect of an accounting change  effective january  subsequent annual calculations required by sfas have indicated no need for further write downs 
asset retirement obligations sfas provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to the future obligations to retire assets aro 
sfas applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition  construction  development and normal operation 
because such obligation relates solely to the company s regulated electric utility  adoption of sfas had no impact on results of operations  however  as of january   the company recorded an aro of approximately million  which exceeded the previously recorded reserve for nuclear plant decommissioning of approximately million 
at december  such aro totaled approximately million 
the company believes that there is legal uncertainty as to the existence of environmental obligations associated with certain transmission and distribution properties 
the company believes that any aro related to this type of property would be insignificant and  due to the indeterminate life of the related assets  an aro could not be reasonably estimated 
other matters unconsolidated special purpose entities although scana invests in securities and business ventures  it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  or as described in financial accounting standards board interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
scana does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions other than incidental operating leases in the normal course of business  generally for office space  furniture and equipment

see note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the nymex futures information above includes those financial positions of energy marketing  scpc and psnc energy 
certain derivatives that scpc utilizes to hedge its gas purchasing activities are recoverable through its weighted average cost of gas calculation 
scpc s tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment pga clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred 
the scpsc has ruled that the results of scpc s hedging activities are to be included in the pga and  as such  are subject to the scpsc s annual prudency review 
the offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a current asset or liability 
beginning in january  psnc energy initiated a hedging program for gas purchasing activities using nymex futures and options 
psnc energy s tariffs include a provision for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred 
psnc energy records transaction fees and any realized gains or losses from derivatives acquired as part of its hedging program in deferred accounts as a regulatory asset or liability for the over or under recovery of gas costs
