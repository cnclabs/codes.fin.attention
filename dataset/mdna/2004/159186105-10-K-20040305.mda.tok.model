item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a designer and manufacturer of telecommunications equipment supplied to telephone and broadband network providers worldwide 
in addition to company manufactured products  the company markets complementary products manufactured by third parties 
the company sells products directly to broadband operators and telephone companies throughout the united states  canada  australia  united kingdom and certain other international markets  principally within developed nations 
the company believes that many of its customers periodically review their supply relationships and consequently the company can experience significant changes in buying patterns from specific customers between fiscal periods 
the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog with sales and operating results in any quarter principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  causes the company s operating results to be at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
the company uses numerous raw materials in its manufacturing processes 
although management believes that the company has adequate sources of supply for such raw materials  increases in the market prices of the company s raw materials could significantly increase the company s cost of goods sold and materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company s profitability may also be materially and adversely affected by decreases in its sales volume because many of the costs associated with the company s facilities  product development  engineering  tooling and other manufacturing processes are essentially fixed in nature and must be spread over its sales base in order to maintain historical levels of profitability 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates and assumptions that management believes have the most significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements are accounts receivables reserves allowances for excess and obsolete inventory valuation of goodwill and long lived assets restructuring costs accounting for income taxes foreign currency translation accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
provisions for estimated sales returns  sales allowances and uncollectible accounts are made at the time of sale based on i the company s estimate of the rate on which customers take discounts allowed and ii the company s specific assessment of the collectability of all past due accounts 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s estimates related to doubtful accounts 
allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
the estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including historical sales and usage of items in inventory  current levels of orders and backlog  forecasted demand  product life cycle and market conditions 
management does not believe the company s products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels in response to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions become less favorable than anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
in the event management adjusts estimates such as forecasted sales or expected product lifecycles  the value of the company s inventory may become understated or overstated and recognition of such understatement or overstatement will affect cost of sales in a future period  which could materially affect the company s operating results and financial position 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets 
management reviews goodwill and long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  and or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated from these assets 
future cash flows may be adversely impacted by operating performance  market conditions and other factors 
an impairment charge would be based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is estimated by management based on market prices  if available  and or forecasted discounted cash flows  using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with fasb statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
one time severance benefits for employees terminated are recorded at the time management commits to the plan to reduce the work force  knows the amount of the termination benefit  is unlikely to change the plan and has communicated to employees the intended work force reduction 
liabilities for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without an economic benefit  such as for facility lease payments for premises vacated  are recorded when the company ceases to use the right conveyed by the contract 
in the case of vacated leased facilities  the liability is based on the future lease payments required under the contract less the estimated future rental income the company may earn by subletting the facilities or estimates of costs incurred to terminate a lease with a landlord 
these estimates of future sublet income are based on current economic conditions  current condition of the local leasing market  past experience and judgments supplied by professionals in the local real estate market 
these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and may change 
additional charges could be required as a result in the changes in estimates 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are recorded for each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
management records the actual current income tax payable and assesses the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in addition  the realization of deferred tax assets is also dependent upon audits by tax authorities of tax filings which may result in a revision to previous amounts claimed 
significant management judgment is involved in assessing the company s ability to realize any future benefit from deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from management estimates and management adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
foreign currency translation 
the company has foreign subsidiaries that together accounted for of the company s net revenues and of the company s assets as of and for the year ended december  in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  the company is required to translate the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries from the currencies in which they keep their accounting records into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the company s statement of operations or as a separate part of the company s net equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
under relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses depends upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
this determination involves consideration of relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures  would be considered the functional currency 
however  management must also consider any dependency of the subsidiary upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations 
if management deems any subsidiary s functional currency to be its local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in a cumulative translation adjustment 
however  if management deems the functional currency to be united states dollars  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within the company s statement of operations 
if the company disposes of any of its subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into the company s statement of operations 
if management determines that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to united states dollars  then any translation gains or losses arising after the date of the change would be included within the company s statement of operations 
based on management s assessment of the factors discussed above  the company considers the functional currency of each of its international subsidiaries to be each subsidiary s local currency 
accordingly  the company had cumulative translation losses of that were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss within the company s balance sheet at december  during the year ended december   the company included translation adjustments of a gain of approximately  under accumulated other comprehensive income and loss 
if the company had determined that the functional currency of its subsidiaries was united states dollars  these gains or losses would have decreased or increased the company s loss for the year ended december  the magnitude of these gains or losses depends upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which the company transacted business as compared to the value of the united states dollar 
these currencies include the british pound  the canadian dollar and the australian dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those the company recorded for the year ended december  new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

all forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k are made pursuant to the act 
forward looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature  which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  or which include words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases 
in addition  any statement concerning future financial performance  ongoing business strategies or prospects  and possible future company actions that may be provided by management are also forward looking statements as defined by the act 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions about the company  and economic and market factors in the countries in which the company does business  among other things 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance  and the company has no specific intentions to update these statements 
actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward looking statements due to a number of factors 
the principal important risk factors that could cause the company s actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the risk factors discussed below 
obsolescence and technological change 
the communications industry is in a state of rapid technological change 
the introduction of new technologies  network architectures or changes in industry standards can render the company s existing products or products under development obsolete or unmarketable 
for example  satellite  wireless and other communication technologies under development or currently being deployed may represent a threat to copper  coaxial and fiber optic based systems by reducing the need for wire line networks 
further  while management anticipates that a number of factors  including network capacity requirements  existing investments in wire line networks  security and long term cost effectiveness  will result in growth of wire line networks  there can be no assurance that future advances or further development of these or other new technologies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s growth strategies are designed  in part  to take advantage of opportunities that the company believes are emerging as a result of the development of enhanced voice  video  data and other transmission networks  and high speed internet access in the telecommunications industry 
there can be no assurance that demand resulting from these emerging trends will continue or that the company s products will be met with market acceptance 
importance of new product development to growth 
a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and remain competitive will be its ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards  and to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
new product development often requires long term forecasting of market trends  development and implementation of new designs and processes  and substantial capital commitment 
trends toward consolidation of the communications industry and convergence of technologies may require the company to quickly adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and customer requirements 
the company s manufacturing and marketing expertise has enabled it to successfully develop and market new products in the past 
however  any failure by the company to anticipate or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to technological developments or changes in industry standards or customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
concentration of customers  limited backlog 
the telecommunications industry is concentrated 
a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of the company s available market 
consequently  the company s five largest customers accounted for and of the company s total net sales in and  respectively 
comcast accounted for of the company s total net sales in comcast accounted for of the company s sales in verizon accounted for of the company s total net sales in mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry  which are expected to continue  not only increase the concentration of the industry and of the company s customer base but also from time to time delay customers capital expenditures as newly merged service providers consolidate operations 
in the event one of the company s major customers were to terminate purchases of the company s products  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
the company s customers typically require prompt shipment of the company s products within a narrow timeframe 
as a result  the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog 
sales and operating results in any quarter are principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
further  the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage see operating leverage below and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  may place the company s operating results at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not coincide with the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on the telecommunications industry 
the company expects that sales to the telecommunications industry will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales 
demand for products within this industry depends primarily on capital spending by service providers for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
the amount of capital spending and  therefore  the company s sales and profitability  are affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  access by service providers to financing  government regulation of service providers  demand for services and technological developments in the telecommunications technology 
while the industry generally experienced above average growth in the late s  since the telecommunications equipment industry has been materially adversely affected by service providers reductions of their capital expenditures 
the company s success is dependent upon continued demand by the communications industry for products used in signal transmission systems which may be affected by factors beyond the company s control  including the convergence of video  voice  and data transmission systems occurring within the broadband and telephone markets  continuing consolidation of companies within those markets and the provision of internet access by broadband operators and local telephone companies 
price fluctuations of raw materials  availability of complementary products 
the company s cost of sales may be materially affected by increases in the market prices of the raw materials  including resins  used in the company s manufacturing processes 
the company does not engage in hedging transactions for such materials  although it periodically enters into purchase agreements for certain raw materials for as much as one year or more 
there can be no assurance that price increases in raw materials can be passed on to the company s customers through increases in product prices 
in addition  in order to position itself as a full line product supplier  the company relies on certain manufacturers to supply products  including grade level boxes that complement the products manufactured by the company 
although the company believes there are multiple sources of supply for these products  disruptions or delays in the supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s own products 
energy costs and availability 
the company s cost of sales may be materially affected by increases in the market prices of electricity  natural gas and water used in the company s manufacturing processes 
california is the site of the company s largest manufacturing operation 
the energy costs of california manufacturing firms may increase 
there exists the possibility of interruption s in the supply of energy to california s manufacturing firms 
there can be no assurance that the company s energy costs can be passed on to the company s customers through increases in product prices 
further  disruptions or delays in the supply of electricity  natural gas and water to the company could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s products 
acquisitions and failure to integrate acquired businesses 
in the event the company pursues any acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and acquire attractive acquisition candidates  profitably manage any such acquired businesses or successfully integrate such acquired businesses into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including  but not limited to  adverse short term effects on the company s reported financial condition or results of operations  diversion of management s attention  dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated problems or liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any businesses acquired in the future will be profitable at the time of acquisition or will achieve sales and profitability justifying the company s investment therein or that the company will realize the synergies expected from such acquisitions 
the failure to obtain any or all of the desired results from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
operating leverage 
because the fixed costs of facilities  product development  engineering  tooling and manufacturing are a relatively high percentage of total costs  the company s ability to operate profitably is dependent on generating a sufficient volume of product sales  thereby spreading fixed costs over the sales base 
due to this operating leverage  a reduction in sales or the rate of sales growth has had in the past and could have in the future a disproportionately adverse effect on the company s financial results 
seasonality and fluctuations in operating results 
the company s business is seasonal in nature  with the first and fourth quarters generally reflecting lower sales due to the impact of adverse weather conditions on construction projects that may alter or postpone the needs of customers for delivery of the company s products 
in addition  first quarter sales may also reflect customer delays in implementation of their annual capital expenditure plans 
the company s operating results may also fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to several other factors  including the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to major customers  the timing of new product introductions and deployment as well as the availability of products by the company or its competitors  the overall level of capital expenditures by broadband operators and telephone companies  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  variations in the mix of products the company sells  and the availability and costs of raw materials 
risks associated with international operations 
international sales  including export sales from us operations  accounted for  and of the company s net sales in  and  respectively 
due to its international sales  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the us dollar which could materially adversely affect us dollar revenues or operating expenses  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  longer collection cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes and the burdens of complying with a variety of international laws and communications standards 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  in connection with its international operations 
there can be no assurance that these risks of conducting business internationally will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
competition 
the industries in which the company operates are highly competitive 
the level and intensity of competition may increase in the future 
the company s competitors include companies that are much larger than the company  such as tyco  m  marconi  arris and corning 
the company s business strategy includes increased focus on telephone connectivity 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against its competitors  most of whom have access to greater financial resources than the company 
disruptions at the company s manufacturing facility  lease with related party 
the majority of the company s manufacturing operations are currently located at the company s facilities in temecula  california  which also includes the company s principal warehouse and corporate office operations 
the company s success depends in large part on the orderly operation of these facilities 
because the company s manufacturing operations and administrative departments are concentrated at this facility  a fire  earthquake  power interruption or other disaster at this facility could materially and adversely affect its business and results of operations 
the company maintains property insurance on this facility as well as business interruption insurance 
the company currently leases a portion of its temecula facilities from william h 
channell  sr  a principal stockholder and chairman of the board of the company 
the company believes the terms of these leases are no less favorable than would be available from an unrelated third party after arm s length negotiations 
although the company has renewal options through the year under these leases  there can be no assurance that the company and mr 
channell  sr 
will be able to agree on additional renewal terms for the properties currently leased by the company 
the failure of the company to renew the leases would require the company to relocate its existing facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the future success of the company depends in part on its ability to attract and retain key executive  engineering  marketing and sales personnel 
key personnel of the company include william h 
channell  sr  chairman of the board  william h 
channell  jr  president and chief executive officer and the other executive officers of the company 
the market for qualified personnel in the communications industry is competitive and the loss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has employment contracts with william h 
channell  jr 
and william h 
channell  sr 
changing regulatory environment 
the communications industry is subject to regulation in the united states and other countries 
federal and state agencies regulate most of the company s domestic customers 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could materially adversely affect the company s business 
uncertain ability to manage industry volatility 
the company s business has required and is expected to continue to require significant company resources in terms of personnel  management and other infrastructure 
the company s ability to manage effectively the volatility of the telecommunications industry requires it to attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  to integrate new employees into its overall operations and to continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems 
environmental matters 
the company is subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and uses a limited number of chemicals that are classified or could be classified as hazardous or similar substances 
although management believes that the company s operations are in compliance in all material respects with current environmental laws and regulations  the company s failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company 
selected quarterly financial data set forth below is certain unaudited quarterly financial information 
see also footnote q to the financial statements included elsewhere herein

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitivity instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all financial instruments held by the company and described below are held for purposes other than trading 
market risk the company s loan and security agreement allows the outstanding balance to bear interest at a variable rate based on the lender s base rate 
the credit facility exposes operations to changes in short term interest rates since the interest rates on the credit facility are variable 
if the variable rates on the company s loan and security agreement were to increase by from the rate at december   and if the company had borrowed during all of fiscal the maximum amount million at any time in under its credit facility at the increased interest rate  the company s interest expense would have increased  and net loss would have increased by million 
a marginal income tax rate of was used in this analysis 
this analysis does not consider the effects of economic activity on the company s sales and profitability in such an environment 
foreign exchange risk the company has assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  australia and canada 
the company s investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term 
accordingly  the company does not hedge these net investments 
the company also purchases a limited portion of its raw materials from foreign countries 
these purchases are generally denominated in us dollars and are accordingly not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
the company has not engaged in forward foreign exchange and other similar contracts to reduce its economic exposure to changes in exchange rates because the associated risk is not considered significant
