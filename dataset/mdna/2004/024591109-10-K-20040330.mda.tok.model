item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on december  the company s subsidiary congoleum and two of its subsidiaries each filed their respective voluntary petitions commencing cases for reorganization relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey 
these chapter cases are being jointly administered as case no 
kcf  styled in re congoleum corporation  et al  to resolve claims that have been or might in the future be asserted against congoleum related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum obtained the asbestos personal injury claimant votes necessary for approval of a proposed pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization and in january  filed its pre packaged plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
based on its pre packaged bankruptcy strategy  which included congoleum settling certain asbestos claims prior to commencing its chapter case  congoleum has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its contribution and costs to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through a plan trust established under section g of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum recorded charges of million in the fourth quarter of  and an additional charge of million in the fourth quarter of  to increase its recorded liability to the estimated minimum cost to complete its reorganization 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for obtaining confirmation of and implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher  which could have a material effect on abi s consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the company is also a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
these matters may have a material adverse impact on the company s or congoleum s financial position and results of operations 
during  the company decided to discontinue the operations of its janus flooring corporation subsidiary  a manufacturer of pre finished hardwood flooring  and sell the related assets 
results of janus flooring  including charges resulting from the shutdown  are being reported as a discontinued operation 
due to congoleum s bankruptcy and separate capital structure  the company believes that presenting abi and its non debtor subsidiaries separately from congoleum is the most meaningful way to discuss and analyze its financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  abi and non debtor subsidiaries net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million or from sales of million in jewelry segment sales decreased million or from due to lower sales to a major mass merchandiser  partly offset by increases in sales to other customers 
tape and canadian segment sales increased slightly as a result of foreign currency translation  absent the weaker dollar  these segments would have reported decreases due to the continued weak economic environment in several of their end use markets 
cost of products sold was of net sales in compared with in gross margins in the tape segment  as a percentage of its sales  improved percentage points due to a more profitable product mix  the weaker dollar  and manufacturing cost improvements 
canadian margins declined percentage points principally due to lower volume 
margins in the jewelry business were the same in as in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  up from million or of net sales in selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to higher costs for insurance  employee medical benefits and professional fees as well as the impact of the weaker dollar on expenses of foreign operations 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to slightly higher average borrowings and higher interest rates under certain of the company s debt agreements 
the effective tax rate in was 
the high effective tax rate in relative to statutory rates was primarily the result of the fact that the canadian division recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising from its losses 
future effective tax rates are expected to be closer to statutory rates  but could fluctuate depending on the results of the canadian division and the magnitude of those results relative to those of other segments 
the net loss from continuing operations was thousand in  compared with income from continuing operations of million in  as a result of the lower profitability of the jewelry business and the loss at the canadian division 
the net loss was million in compared with a net income of million in  or net income of million before a required accounting change 
the lower net income before the required accounting change versus income the previous year was due to the increased loss from discontinued operations in when the charges related to closure of janus were incurred 
congoleum congoleum s net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower sales in the do it yourself tile category coupled with continued weakness in the manufactured housing market 
improved resilient sheet volume  particularly in base grade and trade up builder products  coupled with a price increase and lower sales allowances  helped to partially mitigate the sales decline 
congoleum s gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for the year ended december  gross margins improved slightly as improved pricing  manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction programs helped offset raw material cost increases 
congoleum s selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for and included million and million of cost associated with asbestos related claims  respectively 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and respectively 
during  cost savings initiatives were implemented that helped offset increases in pension  medical and other related costs 
congoleum recorded a charge of million during the fourth quarter of  included in selling  general  and administrative expenses  to increase its recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims 
the recorded liability at december  represents the minimum estimated cost that congoleum will incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of congoleum s proposed plan of reorganization 
if congoleum is not successful in obtaining confirmation of its proposed plan of reorganization in a timely manner  actual costs could be significantly higher 
the proposed plan also would require congoleum to make an additional contribution to the plan trust one year after confirmation of the plan equal to of any increase in the market value of congoleum s shares at that time over their value on june  no provision has been made for the cost of this possible additional contribution  which could be material 
congoleum will adjust its recorded liability should its estimates change 
the loss from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   an improvement of million 
this smaller loss from operations was primarily due to the lower asbestos related charge  offset by lower gross margin dollars 
interest income declined from million in to million in due to lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  reflecting increased borrowings under the revolver 
congoleum recorded a tax benefit of million on a loss before income taxes of million in as a result of utilizing certain loss carry forwards that had previously been fully reserved 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  abi and non debtor subsidiaries net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or from sales of million in the increase in sales was due to higher jewelry segment sales 
jewelry sales increased as a result of sales of a line of licensed products acquired in july  as well as continued growth with a major mass merchandiser 
tape and canadian segment sales declined due to the poor economic environment in several of their end use markets 
cost of products sold was of net sales in  down slightly from in within segments  gross margins improved at tape  were level in canada  and declined in jewelry due to costs for the acquired line of licensed products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales  up from million or of net sales in the increase was primarily due higher selling expenses at k m related to increased sales 
in addition  all operations experienced cost increases for insurance and employee benefits 
other income increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of gains on foreign exchange 
income from continuing operations was million in compared with million in results in the jewelry segment improved from to  while income declined at the tape and canadian businesses 
net income after a million charge for a required accounting change in was million  compared to million in the company recorded a non cash transitional charge of million in the first quarter of for impairment of goodwill that resulted from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
congoleum congoleum s net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from strong sales of the durastone product line  which was introduced in august  and improved resilient sheet sales in both the base grade and trade up builder segment  partially offset by lower luxury and contract tile sales 
congoleum s gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales  an increase of million over the year ended december  gross profit margins declined slightly as costs of expanding sales and the product mix impact of increased base grade builder product sales offset improved manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction programs 
congoleum s selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   which includes asbestos related costs of million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to the asbestos related charge  significant investments in additional displays and samples to support the durastone product line and higher promotional support contributed to the increase 
congoleum recorded a charge of million  in the fourth quarter of  included in selling  general and administrative expenses  to adjust its recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims against it 
the recorded liability at december  represented the then minimum estimated cost that congoleum would incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through a plan of reorganization 
loss from operations was million for the year ended december   compared to income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this change was primarily due to the asbestos charge 
interest income declined from million in to million in due to a combination of lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  due to lower capitalized interest in compared to congoleum recorded a tax provision of thousand on a loss before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting change of million in the tax provision included a benefit from the reduction of thousand for a tax valuation allowance as a result of utilizing certain loss carry forwards that had previously been fully reserved 
this benefit was offset by an additional provision for valuation allowance 
for  the effective tax rate was resulting in a tax benefit of thousand which included a reduction for a tax valuation allowance of thousand 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
sfas no 
was effective for congoleum as of january  during the first quarter of  congoleum performed a transitional impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
and concluded that there was impairment 
congoleum compared the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill and it was determined that based on the fair value of congoleum s assets and liabilities  there should be no goodwill recorded 
accordingly  congoleum recorded an impairment loss of million during the first quarter of  which has been recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  during the fourth quarter of  congoleum recorded other comprehensive expense of million relating to the recognition of a minimum pension liability 
congoleum reduced its assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets from to and its discount rate from to 
liquidity and capital resources abi and non debtor subsidiaries at december   consolidated working capital was million  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to  and the debt to equity ratio was to net cash provided by operations during was million 
as discussed below  because the majority of the company s debt agreements must be amended or extended prior to december   the related liabilities are classified as current 
the company anticipates that it will obtain the necessary amendments or extensions  or otherwise refinance the related debt 
if the company were unable to do so  it would have a material adverse effect on liquidity 
although the company currently has no material commitments for capital expenditures  it plans to make expenditures during of approximately million to million 
capital expenditures generally cover normal replacement of machinery and equipment and process improvements 
in  abi entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement with prudential insurance company the prudential agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  abi borrowed million and used the proceeds to retire existing long term and revolving debt 
the prudential agreement was amended in october and january to revise certain financial covenants to afford the company with greater flexibility to comply with those covenants and requires the company to comply with additional covenants consistent with those included in the fleet agreement as discussed below 
in connection with the amendment  the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries granted prudential a security interest in most of the company s and its domestic subsidiaries assets 
the security interest granted to prudential does not include the assets or shares of capital stock of congoleum 
certain domestic subsidiaries of the company have agreed to guaranty the company s obligations under the amended prudential agreement 
the security interests granted under the prudential agreement are on parity with security interests granted under the fleet agreement 
the notes issued under the prudential agreement bear interest at plus an additional fee on each interest payment date if the company s and certain of its subsidiaries ratio of debt to ebitda  as defined under the amended fleet agreement  exceeds certain levels 
the amount of those fees that may be payable by the company varies depending on the extent the company s and certain of its subsidiaries debt exceeds ebitda and is capped at of the outstanding principal amount of the series a notes 
principal is repayable in five annual million installments beginning august  because the prudential agreement  as amended  requires the fleet agreement to be replaced or refinanced effective no later than december  and the related commitment to be in place no later than november   amounts outstanding under the prudential agreement are classified as current liabilities 
in october  the company and k m entered into a new credit agreement the fleet agreement which was further amended on january  the january amendment eliminated a participating lender under the agreement and reduced the maximum borrowings under the agreement from million to million 
the company expects to further amend the agreement to permit the company s canadian subsidiary to grant a security interest under that subsidiary s credit agreement the cibc agreement 
the fleet agreement  as amended  replaces a previous revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the fleet agreement  the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries granted the lender a security interest in most of the company s and its domestic subsidiaries assets 
the security interests granted are on parity with security interests granted under the prudential agreement 
the security interest granted to the lenders does not include the assets or shares of capital stock of congoleum 
under the fleet agreement as amended  the company and k m are subject to various financial and other covenants 
the amount of borrowings that may be outstanding at any time under the fleet agreement are determined by a borrowing base formula applied to inventory  receivables and fixed assets of the company and certain of its subsidiaries  reduced by amounts outstanding under the prudential agreement  subject to a maximum of million 
interest is payable on amounts borrowed under the fleet agreement at rates which generally range from a libor based rate plus to a libor based rate plus depending on the company s leverage ratio  as determined under the fleet agreement 
certain domestic subsidiaries of the company have agreed to guaranty the company s obligations under the fleet agreement 
the fleet agreement expires on december  the company s canadian subsidiary is financed under the cibc agreement that provided a million canadian dollar us million capital loan and provides an operating loan facility of million canadian dollars us million 
proceeds of the capital loan were used to fund acquisitions of property and equipment in canada 
the capital loan is payable in equal quarterly installments which began on february  and bears interest at 
the operating loan is payable on demand and bears interest at a floating rate which was at december  the company has agreed  subject to consent of lenders under the fleet and prudential agreement  to permit borrowings under the cibc agreement to be secured by the canadian division s inventory  receivables  and equipment 
certain borrowing agreements of the company or its subsidiaries restrict the ability of the company or the borrowing subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  or make capital expenditures in excess of a specified aggregate  and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and minimum net worth levels 
the covenants and conditions under those borrowing agreements must be met in order for the company to borrow under those agreements 
in addition  borrowings under the fleet agreement are based upon the amount of domestic inventory  accounts receivable and fixed assets available as collateral 
these considerations could limit the company s ability to fully utilize the million available under its existing lines of credit 
at december   million was outstanding under these lines and million secured outstanding letters of credit  and million was available for borrowing based on collateral levels 
cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  and any dividends or share repurchases are expected to be financed from operating activities and borrowings under existing lines of credit 
existing resources  together with the cash generated from operations  is expected to be sufficient to meet the capital requirements of the current operations for the foreseeable future 
the following table summarizes the company s obligations at december  for future principal payments on its long term debt assuming any necessary amendments or waivers are obtained from its lenders and future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases 
payments due by period amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years years years long term debt      operating leases    on december  the company s subsidiary congoleum and two of its subsidiaries each filed voluntary petitions with the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey case no 
seeking relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as part of congoleum s plan of reorganization  abi expects that congoleum s indemnification obligations to abi with respect to current and future asbestos claims related to its former tile division operations not covered by abi insurance will be channeled to the trust established in connection with congoleum s chapter plan of reorganization 
abi expects to contribute thousand in cash and a pledge of its congoleum shares as collateral for congoleum s obligations to the trust that would be established in connection with congoleum s chapter reorganization 
abi does not expect its cash contribution or pledge would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or capital resources 
in addition  the company is a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits as well  and is a party to congoleum s litigation with its insurance carriers 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is included at item these matters may have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources congoleum congoleum s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business  and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should congoleum be unable to continue as a going concern 
as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about congoleum s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum is a defendant in a large number of asbestos related lawsuits and on december  filed a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  which are contained in item of this annual report on form k 
these matters will have a material adverse impact on congoleum s liquidity and capital resources 
during  congoleum paid million in defense and indemnity costs related to asbestos related claims and million in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter and litigation with certain insurance companies 
congoleum expects to spend a further million at a minimum in fees  expenses  and trust contributions in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan 
congoleum also expects to recover million from the collateral trust or its successor pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents which provide for the trust to reimburse certain expenses of congoleum 
timing of such recovery will depend on when the trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  a decrease of million from december  under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on congoleum s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by congoleum to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
restricted cash represents funds deposited in this account but not immediately applied to the loan balance 
working capital was million at december   down from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to one  compared to to one a year earlier 
the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was 
compared to 
in net cash used by operations during the year ended december  was million  as compared to cash provided by operations of million in cash from operations decreased from to as funds were used to reduce accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by lower inventories and accounts receivables 
expenditures related to asbestos liabilities and congoleum s reorganization plan were million  in  compared to million in  accounting for slightly more than half the decrease 
the remainder of the decrease was primarily due to a low level of manufacturing and shipment activity at the end of  combined with creditors managing their pre petition credit exposure  and congoleum prepaying certain expenses  prior to its december  chapter filing 
these accounts are not expected to remain at the unusually low levels experienced at the end of capital expenditures in totaled million 
congoleum is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between and million in in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing provides a one year revolving credit facility with borrowings up to million 
interest is based on 
above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants which include the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and ebitda 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financial agreement must be met in order for congoleum to borrow from the facility 
congoleum was in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  congoleum had base borrowing availability of million  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
congoleum anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility will be replaced with a revolving credit facility on substantially similar terms upon confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
while congoleum expects the facilities discussed above will provide it with sufficient liquidity  there can be no assurances that it will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants  that congoleum will be able to obtain a similar or sufficient facility upon exit from bankruptcy  or that the debtor in possession facility would be renewed if congoleum s plan of reorganization is not confirmed by that facility s expiration on december  in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  congoleum has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
congoleum is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against congoleum 
among these claims  congoleum is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in legal proceedings in part i  item and environmental regulation in part i  item 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of congoleum s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of congoleum s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
congoleum has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while congoleum believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from congoleum s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on congoleum s costs  congoleum is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against congoleum 
congoleum s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
although congoleum did not generate cash from operations in as more fully discussed above  congoleum anticipates that it will generate cash from operations in congoleum believes these sources will be adequate to fund working capital requirements  debt service payments  planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  and its current estimates for costs to settle and resolve its asbestos liabilities through its pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
congoleum s inability to obtain confirmation of the proposed plan in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on congoleum s ability to fund its operating  investing and financing requirements 
the following table summarizes congoleum s contractual obligations for future principal payments on its debt and future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases at december  congoleum does not have payment obligations under capital leases or long term purchase contracts 
payments due by period amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt   operating leases      total      contingencies the company s subsidiary congoleum is seeking confirmation of a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve liabilities related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to seven years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites

abi has recorded provisions in its consolidated financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the company decided to cease operations at its janus division and recorded a charge of million in the second quarter consisting primarily of million to reduce inventories to net realizable value  million in accounts receivable allowances  a million asset impairment charge related to machinery and equipment and a million income tax provision to write off deferred tax assets deemed not probable of recovery 
the company disposed of substantially all of the assets of janus  other than the real estate  during future expenditures related to this discontinued operation are not expected to be material  and the company expects to realize approximately million in net future cash proceeds from the sale of the real estate 
pursuant to a debt agreement the company has with one of its lenders  the net sales proceeds from any sale or disposition of janus building must be first applied to repay amounts owed by the company s wholly owned subsidiary ab canada under its credit agreement with any remaining net sales proceeds to be applied to repaying amounts outstanding under the company s credit facilities 
if the company is unable to timely sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of janus on terms acceptable to abi and in accordance with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements  including canadian regulations and laws  such inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company and its subsidiary congoleum are parties to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from their previous manufacture of asbestos containing products 
abi has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation and pay for related legal and loss handling costs 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
due to the numerous uncertainties related to future asbestos litigation trends and costs  the company does not believe reasonable estimates can be developed beyond a five year horizon 
accordingly  the company s estimated liability is based on claims currently filed as well as claims anticipated to be filed over the next five years 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from the assumptions used in developing the company s estimates 
the company s subsidiary congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products and is seeking confirmation of a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
congoleum s liability for settlements of asbestos claims is at least million  not including the cost to defend and litigate unsettled or future cases  which is substantially in excess of both the total assets of congoleum as well as congoleum s previous estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for both known and unasserted claims 
while congoleum purchased insurance coverage it believes applies to these claims  some of the insurance carriers are presently insolvent and the remaining solvent insurance carriers have disputed their coverage obligations 
congoleum believes the ultimate amount of its liability  and the amount of recoverable insurance  will be determined through some combination of negotiation  litigation  and bankruptcy court order  but that these amounts can no longer be reasonably estimated given all the uncertainties that presently exist 
congoleum expects that insurance will provide the vast majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of congoleum itself 
congoleum believes that it does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business  and filed for bankruptcy protection on december  in light of its bankruptcy filing and pre packaged plan of reorganization  congoleum believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
congoleum estimates the minimum remaining costs to complete this plan to be million  which it has recorded as a current liability 
the maximum amount of asbestos losses is limited to the going concern or liquidation value of congoleum  an amount which congoleum believes is substantially less than the minimum estimated liability for the known claims against it 
the company also expects to recover million from the collateral trust or its successor pursuant to terms of the claimant agreement and related documents which provide for the trust to reimburse certain expenses of the company 
timing of such recovery will depend on when the trust receives funds from insurance settlements or other sources 
congoleum will update its estimates as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  resulting in potentially material adjustments to congoleum s earnings in future periods 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
management has recorded both liabilities and insurance receivables in its consolidated financial statements for its estimate of future remediation activities 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company will provide for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  management makes certain assumptions as to future events such as the ability to generate future taxable income 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company uses a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below 
sfas no 
requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plans assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on the company s computation of pension income expense be amortized over future periods 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
in  the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency

risk factors that may affect future results the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum have significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and the company s and congoleum s strategies for resolving this exposure may not be successful 
as more fully set forth in notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in this report  the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum have significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos personal injury claims 
congoleum has entered into settlement agreements with various asbestos claimants totaling million 
settlement of this obligation pursuant to the terms of congoleum s proposed pre packaged plan is dependent on bankruptcy court confirmation of the plan  including determinations by the bankruptcy court that the plan has satisfied certain criteria under the bankruptcy code  among other things 
there can be no assurance that congoleum will be successful in obtaining confirmation of congoleum s pre packaged plan in a timely manner or at all 
any alternative plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum or confirmed by the bankruptcy court could vary significantly from the description in this report including descriptions incorporated by reference in this report 
furthermore  the estimated costs and contributions required to confirm and to effect the proposed pre packaged plan of reorganization or an alternative plan could be significantly greater than currently estimated 
any plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum will be subject to numerous conditions  approvals and other requirements  including bankruptcy court approvals  and there can be no assurance that such conditions  approvals and other requirements will be satisfied or obtained 
some additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from congoleum s and the company s objectives for resolving asbestos liability include i the future cost and timing of estimated asbestos liabilities and payments and availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from insurance companies  which underwrote the applicable insurance policies for congoleum and the company  for asbestos related claims  ii costs relating to the execution and implementation of any plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum  iii timely reaching an agreement with other creditors  or classes of creditors  that exist or may emerge  iv the company s and congoleum s satisfaction of the conditions and obligations under their respective outstanding debt instruments and the proposed pre packaged plan  v the response from time to time of the company s and congoleum s lenders  customers  suppliers and other constituencies to the pre packaged chapter process and related developments arising from the strategy to settle asbestos liability  vi congoleum s ability to maintain debtor in possession financing sufficient to provide it with funding that may be needed during the pendency of its chapter case and to obtain exit financing sufficient to provide it with funding that may be needed for its operations after emerging from the bankruptcy process  in each case  on reasonable terms  vii timely obtaining sufficient creditor and court approval of any reorganization plan  viii developments in and the outcome of insurance coverage litigation pending in new jersey state court involving congoleum  abi  and certain insurers  and ix compliance with the bankruptcy code  including section g 
in addition  in view of american biltrite s relationships with congoleum  american biltrite could be affected by congoleum s negotiations  and there can be no assurance as to what that impact  positive or negative  might be 
in any event  the failure of congoleum to obtain confirmation of its anticipated pre packaged plan of reorganization would have a material adverse effect on congoleum s business  results of operations or financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on american biltrite s business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  there has been federal legislation proposed that  if adopted  would establish a national trust to provide compensation to victims of asbestos related injuries and channel all current and future asbestos related personal injury claims to that trust 
due to the uncertainties involved with the pending legislation  the company does not know what effects any such legislation  if adopted  may have upon its or congoleum s businesses  results of operations or financial conditions  or upon any plan of reorganization congoleum may decide to pursue 
to date  congoleum has expended significant amounts pursuant to resolving its asbestos liability relating to its proposed prepackaged chapter plan of reorganization 
to the extent any federal legislation is enacted which does not credit congoleum for amounts paid by congoleum pursuant to its plan of reorganization or requires the company or congoleum to pay significant amounts to any national trust or otherwise  such legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company or congoleum s businesses  results of operations and financial conditions 
as a result of congoleum s significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims  there can be no assurance that if congoleum were to incur any unforecasted or unexpected liability or disruption to its business or operations it would be able to withstand that liability or disruption and continue as an operating company 
any significant increase of the company s asbestos liability and funding exposure would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations and financial condition and possibly its ability to continue as a going concern 
for further information regarding the company s and congoleum s asbestos liability  insurance coverage and strategies to resolve that asbestos liability  please see notes  and of notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum may incur substantial liability for environmental claims and compliance matters 
due to the nature of the company s and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum s businesses and certain of the substances which are or have been used  produced or discharged by them  the company s and congoleum s operations and facilities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  local and foreign legal and regulatory provisions relating to the environment  including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances at company and congoleum facilities and off site disposal locations 
the company and congoleum have historically expended substantial amounts for compliance with existing environmental laws or regulations  including environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company and congoleum owned sites 
the company and congoleum will continue to be required to expend amounts in the future because of the nature of their prior activities at their facilities  to comply with existing environmental laws  and those amounts may be substantial 
although the company and congoleum believe that those amounts should not have a material adverse effect on their respective financial position  there is no certainty that these amounts will not have a material adverse effect on their respective financial positions because  as a result of environmental requirements becoming increasingly strict  neither the company nor congoleum is able to determine the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies 
moreover  in addition to potentially having to pay substantial amounts for compliance  future environmental laws or regulations may require or cause the company or congoleum to modify or curtail their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum  may incur substantial liability for other product and general liability claims 
in the ordinary course of their businesses  the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum become involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings  product liability claims and other matters 
in some of these proceedings  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts and the matters may remain unresolved for several years 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition if the company or congoleum  as applicable  is unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters and its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against it or settlements relating to these matters or the company or congoleum  as applicable  is unable to collect insurance proceeds relating to these matters

most of the raw materials required by the company for its manufacturing operations are available from multiple sources  however  the company does purchase some of its raw materials from a single source or supplier 
any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of raw materials could substantially increase the company s cost of materials  require product reformulation or require qualification of new suppliers  any one or more of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s majority owned subsidiary congoleum  does not have readily available alternative sources of supply for specific designs of transfer print paper  which are produced utilizing print cylinders engraved to congoleum s specifications 
although congoleum does not anticipate any loss of this source of supply  replacement could take a considerable period of time and interrupt production of certain products  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition

furthermore  to the extent any of the company s or congoleum s competitors make a filing under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and emerge from bankruptcy as a continuing operating company that has shed much of their pre filing liabilities  those competitors could have a cost competitive advantage over congoleum 
in addition  in order to maintain their competitive positions  the company and congoleum may need to make substantial investments in their businesses  including  as applicable  product development  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for their products and in the loss of market share for their products 
moreover  due to the competitive nature of their industries  they may be commercially restricted from raising or even maintaining the sales prices of their products  which could result in the incurrence of significant operating losses if their expenses were to increase or otherwise represent an increased percentage of sales 
the markets in which the company and congoleum compete are characterized by frequent new product introductions and changing customer preferences 
there can be no assurance that the company s and congoleum s existing products and services will be properly positioned in the market or that the company and congoleum will be able to introduce new or enhanced products or services into their respective markets on a timely basis  or at all  or that those new or enhanced products or services will receive customer acceptance 
the company s and congoleum s failure to introduce new or enhanced products or services on a timely basis  keep pace with industry or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products  technologies or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition

if the company or congoleum were to realize an unexpected  significant and prolonged disruption of its operations at any of its facilities  including disruptions in its manufacturing operations  it could result in shipment delays of its products  depletion of its inventory as a result of reduced production and increased production costs as a result of taking actions in an attempt to cure the disruption or carry on its business while the disruption remains 
any resulting delay  depletion or increased production cost could result in increased costs  lower revenues and damaged customer and product end user relations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum offer limited warranties on their products which could result in the company or congoleum incurring significant costs as a result of warranty claims 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum offer a limited warranty on many of their products against manufacturing defects 
in addition  as a part of its efforts to differentiate mid and high end products through color  design and other attributes  congoleum offers enhanced warranties with respect to wear  moisture discoloration and other performance characteristics which generally increase with the price of such products 
if the company or congoleum were to incur a significant number of warranty claims  the resulting warranty costs could be substantial 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum rely on a small number of customers and distributors for a significant portion of their sales or to sell their products 
the company s tape division principally sells its products through distributors 
sales to five unaffiliated customers accounted for approximately of the company s tape division s net sales for the year ended december  and of its net sales for the year ended december  the loss of the largest unaffiliated customer and or two or more of the other unaffiliated customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s majority owned subsidiary congoleum principally sells its products through distributors 
although congoleum has more than one distributor in some of its distribution territories and actively manages its credit exposure to its distributors  the loss of a major distributor could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
congoleum derives a significant percentage of its sales from two of its distributors 
these two distributors accounted for approximately of congoleum s net sales for the year ended december  and of congoleum s net sales for the year ended december  the company s subsidiary k m associates lp sells its products through its own direct sales force and  indirectly  through a wholly owned subsidiary and through third party sales representatives 
three of k m associates lp s customers accounted for approximately of its net sales for the year ended december  and of its net sales for the year ended december  the loss of k m associates lp s largest customer would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
a portion of the company s debt must be amended or refinanced prior to december the company s revolving credit agreement expires on december  in addition  terms of the company s prudential agreement require the company to have a commitment to extend or replace the fleet agreement no later than november   with such financing effective no later than december  although the company expects to extend the fleet agreement  there can be no assurances that it will be able to do so  and such failure could have a material adverse effect on liquidity 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum depend on key executives to run their businesses  and the loss of any of these executives would likely harm the company s business 
the company and its majority owned subsidiary congoleum depend on key executives to run their businesses 
in particular  the same persons that serve as key executives at the company also serve as key executives at congoleum 
the company s future success will depend largely upon the continued service of these key executives  all of whom have no employment contract with the company or congoleum  as applicable  and may terminate their employment at any time without notice 
although certain key executives of the company and congoleum are  directly or indirectly  large shareholders of the company or congoleum  and thus are less likely to terminate their employment  the loss of any key executive  or the failure by the key executive to perform in his current position  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments but does not consider this interest rate market risk exposure to be material to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and short term less than one year maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short term maturities 
substantially all of the company s outstanding long term debt as of december  consisted of indebtedness with a fixed rate of interest  which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates 
the company operates internationally  principally in canada  europe and the far east  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates 
to a certain extent  foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect the company s competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
for foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect abi s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
under its current policies  the company does not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices and does not hold any instruments for trading purposes
