marketing programs all company owned and franchised papa john s restaurants within a co developed market are required to join an area advertising cooperative co op 
each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the co op for market wide programs  such as radio  television and print advertising 
the rate of contribution and uses of the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the co op s members 
the restaurant level and co op marketing efforts are supported by print and electronic advertising materials that are produced by the papa john s marketing fund  inc  a non profit corporation the marketing fund 
the marketing fund produces and buys air time for papa john s national television commercials  in addition to other brand building activities  such as consumer research 
all domestic company owned and franchised papa john s restaurants are required to contribute a percentage of sales to the marketing fund 
the contribution percentage was in and in and restaurant level marketing programs target the delivery area of each restaurant  making extensive use of targeted print materials in direct mail and store to door couponing 
the local marketing efforts also include a variety of community oriented activities with schools  sports teams and other organizations 
in markets in which papa john s has a significant presence  local marketing efforts are supplemented with radio and television advertising 
we provide both company owned and franchised restaurants with catalogs for the purchase of uniforms and promotional items and pre approved print marketing materials 
we also provide direct marketing services to company owned and franchised restaurants using customer information gathered by our proprietary point of sale technology see company operations point of sale technology 
we have developed a system by which all domestic papa john s restaurant customers are able to place orders on line via the internet 
we receive a percentage fee based on on line sales from domestic franchisees  in addition to royalties  for this service 
in november  we began offering our customers the opportunity to purchase a reloadable gift card  papa card that can be purchased in any denomination between and the papa card may be redeemed for delivery  carryout and on line orders and is accepted at substantially all papa john s traditional us restaurants 
in december  we hired a new chief marketing officer cmo 
the cmo is currently evaluating existing marketing programs and may modify or eliminate such programs  or add new programs as deemed appropriate and necessary 
company operations restaurant personnel 
a typical papa john s restaurant employs a restaurant manager  one or two assistant managers and approximately to hourly team members  most of whom work part time 
the manager is responsible for the day to day operation of the restaurant and maintaining company established operating standards 
the operating standards and other resources are contained in a comprehensive operations manual supplied to each restaurant 
we seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and staff  provide comprehensive training on operations and managerial skills  and motivate and retain them by providing opportunities for advancement and performance based financial incentives 
historically  we employed area supervisors  each of whom had responsibility for overseeing three to six company owned restaurants 
we also employed district managers who oversaw area supervisors and managers within their respective markets 
beginning in  we combined the area supervisor and district manager positions into a director of operations position 
restaurant initiatives 
during and  several restaurant initiatives were undertaken with the ultimate goal of improving the quality and consistency of the customer experience 
the first of these initiatives was the development of a systematic approach to monitor and evaluate key components of the total customer experience  the refinement and enhancement of which is ongoing 
a second initiative was an across the board increase in base pay for restaurant general managers and assistant managers in an effort to attract and retain the desired quality of individuals to these critical positions 
in january  we realigned field operations management by combining the area supervisor and district manager positions into a director of operations position 
a director of operations is responsible for seven restaurants on average  thus providing higher quality direct support to our general managers and their teams 
the entire cost savings from the realignment was invested in increased staffing 
in addition  during  we implemented a system wide initiative to increase portions for several core pizza products to enhance our customer experience 
we saw improved operational trends during as a result of these initiatives  including reduced turnover at the general manager and assistant manager positions and improved product quality and consistency 
however  for the first nine months of  the improvements did not result in increased sales as the overall restaurant industry  the pizza category and the economy produced a challenging environment 
according to industry sources  customer traffic count has been relatively flat or declining in the quick service restaurant pizza segment for the latest reported seven consecutive quarters 
given the current industry and overall economic environment  management cannot predict when operational improvements resulting from these initiatives or otherwise  may result in consistently improving sales trends 
however  we are encouraged that our company owned restaurants reported a increase in comparable sales during the fourth quarter of  a increase in january and a increase in february training and education 
we have a department dedicated to training and developing team members  as well as assisting with new restaurant openings 
with regional training locations across the country  we are capable of training multiple operators during new program or product introductions 
we provide an on site training team three days before and three days after the opening of any company owned or franchised restaurant requesting assistance 
operations personnel  both corporate and franchise  complete our management training program and on going development programs in which instruction is given on all aspects of our systems and operations 
the programs include hands on training and some classroom instruction at an operating papa john s restaurant by a company certified general training manager 
our training includes new team member orientation  in store and delivery training  core management skills training  new product or program implementation and ongoing developmental programs 
point of sale technology 
point of sale technology our proprietary profit system tm is in place in all domestic traditional papa john s restaurants and in substantially all papa john s international restaurants 
we believe this technology facilitates faster and more accurate order taking and pricing  reduces paperwork and allows the restaurant manager to better monitor and control food and labor costs 
we believe the profit system enhances restaurant level marketing capabilities through the development of a database containing information on customers and their buying habits with respect to our products 
polling capabilities allow us to obtain restaurant operating information  thereby improving the speed  accuracy and efficiency of restaurant level reporting 
during the next year  we will introduce the next generation of the profit system to the domestic and international papa john s system 
we believe this updated version will improve operational efficiencies at the restaurant level and improve our data collection process 
reporting 
management at company owned restaurants evaluates daily reports of sales  cash deposits and operating costs 
physical inventories of all food and beverage items are taken nightly 
hours of operations 
our domestic restaurants are open seven days a week  typically from am to am monday through thursday  am to am on friday and saturday and noon to am on sunday 
franchise program general 
we continue to attract franchisees with significant restaurant and retail experience 
we consider our franchisees to be a vital part of our system s continued growth and believe our relationship with our franchisees is good 
as of december   there were  franchised papa john s restaurants operating in states  the district of columbia  and international markets  and franchised perfect pizza restaurants operating in the united kingdom 
as of december   we have development agreements with our domestic franchisees for approximately additional franchised restaurants committed to open through and agreements for additional international franchised restaurants to open through there can be no assurance that all of these restaurants will be opened or that the development schedule set forth in the development agreements will be achieved 
there are no formal development agreements for franchised perfect pizza restaurants and we plan to open very few  if any  perfect pizza units in the future 
our plan is to attract new franchisees  and to work with existing franchisees  to open new papa john s restaurants in the united kingdom and evaluate converting existing perfect pizza restaurants to the papa john s brand over time 
during  domestic and international franchised papa john s restaurants were opened  and two perfect pizza franchised restaurants were opened 
our franchisees have converted perfect pizza restaurants to papa john s restaurants since approval 
franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant s business background  restaurant operating experience and financial resources 
we seek franchisees to enter into development agreements for single or multiple restaurants 
we require the franchisee to either complete our training program or to hire a full time operator who completes the training and has either an equity interest or the right to acquire an equity interest in the franchise operation 
development and franchise agreements 
we enter into development agreements with our domestic franchisees for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area 
under our current standard development agreement  the franchisee is required to pay  at the time of signing the agreement  a non refundable fee of  for the first restaurant and  for any additional restaurants 
the non refundable fee is credited against the standard  franchise fee payable to us upon signing the franchise agreement for a specific location 
the fee is expected to increase to  in generally  a franchise agreement is executed when a franchisee secures a location 
our current standard domestic franchise agreement provides for a term of ten years with one ten year renewal option and payment to us of a royalty fee of of sales 
the current agreement  as well as substantially all existing franchise agreements  permits us to increase the royalty fee up to of sales 
the royalty fee cannot be increased to an amount greater than the percentage royalty fee then in effect for new franchisees 
we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons  including a franchisee s failure to make payments when due or failure to adhere to our policies and standards 
many state franchise laws limit the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise 
we opened our first franchised restaurant outside the united states in we define international markets to be all markets outside the contiguous united states in which we have either a development agreement or a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area  therefore  a country could be divided into multiple markets 
under a master franchise agreement  the franchisee has the right to subfranchise a portion of the development to one or more subfranchisees approved by us 
under our current standard international development agreement except for hawaii and alaska in which the initial fees are the same as domestic restaurants  the franchisee is required to pay total fees of  per restaurant   at the time of signing the agreement  and  when the restaurant opens or the agreed upon development date  whichever comes first 
under our current standard master franchise agreement  the master franchisee is required to pay total fees of  per restaurant owned and operated by the master franchisee  under the same terms as the development agreement  and  for each subfranchised restaurant   at the time of signing the agreement and  when the restaurant opens or the agreed upon development date  whichever comes first 
our current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty fee of of sales including sales by subfranchised restaurants  with no provision for increase 
the remaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the terms of our standard domestic franchise agreement 
we franchise restaurants in the united kingdom under perfect pizza franchise agreements  which were in effect at the time of our acquisition in these franchise agreements differ from our standard international franchise agreements in many respects  although with few material differences 
a principal difference is the term of the agreement  which is five years 
the franchise fee is  approximately  at an exchange rate of as of december   and the royalty rate of is the same as in our standard international agreements 
the perfect pizza system has been developed principally through franchising of individual restaurants to single location franchisees 
thus  the system historically had no equivalent to our development agreements or master franchise agreements 
recently  pjuk entered into multiple unit development agreements for territories in northwest london and in scotland 
we have entered into a limited number of development and franchise agreements for non traditional restaurant units and continue to analyze opportunities to expand these types of units 
these agreements generally cover venues or areas not originally targeted for development and have terms differing from the standard agreement 
these agreements have not had a significant impact on our revenues or earnings 
franchise restaurant development 
we provide assistance to papa john s franchisees in selecting sites  developing restaurants and evaluating the physical specifications for typical restaurants 
each franchisee is responsible for selecting the location for its restaurants but must obtain our approval of restaurant design and location based on accessibility and visibility of the site and targeted demographic factors  including population  density  income  age and traffic 
our domestic franchisees may purchase complete new store equipment packages through an approved third party supplier under a commission arrangement with the company 
internationally  our franchisees buy their equipment from approved third party suppliers 
franchisee loans 
selected franchisees have borrowed funds from our subsidiary  capital delivery  ltd  principally for use in the construction and development of their restaurants 
we have also entered into loan agreements with certain franchisees that purchased restaurants from us or other franchisees 
loans made to franchisees typically bear interest at fixed or floating rates with a stated average interest rate of at december  and in most cases are secured by the fixtures  equipment and signage and where applicable  the land of the restaurant and the ownership interests in the franchisee 
at december   franchisee loans outstanding totaled million  net of a million reserve for uncollectible amounts 
the loans outstanding include a loan of million to the marketing fund see marketing programs  that was repaid in january we do not plan to extend significant loans to franchisees in the future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have a commitment to lend up to million to bibp  a franchisee owned corporation 
during  no amounts were outstanding to bibp 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
franchise insurance program 
we provide our franchisees an opportunity to purchase various insurance policies  such as non owned automobile and workers compensation  through our insurance agency  risk services corp 
risk services 
in october  we established a captive insurance company located in bermuda  rsc insurance services  ltd  to accommodate this business 
we have specific and aggregate reinsurance to limit the exposure to the captive insurance company 
as of december   approximately of domestic franchise restaurants had obtained insurance coverage through risk services 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
franchise training and support 
every franchisee is required to have a principal operator approved by us who satisfactorily completes our required training program and who devotes his or her full business time and efforts to the operation of the franchisee s restaurants 
each franchise restaurant manager is also required to complete our company certified management training program 
we provide an on site training crew three days before and three days after the opening of a franchisee s first two restaurants 
ongoing supervision of training is monitored by the corporate franchise training team 
multi unit franchisees are encouraged to appoint training store general managers or hire a full time training coordinator certified to deliver company approved programs in order to train new team members and management candidates for their restaurants 
our area franchise directors maintain open communication with the franchise community  relaying operating and marketing information and new ideas between franchisees and us 
internationally  training is monitored by our international director of training as well as regional directors and international business managers assigned to specific franchisee territories 
we also maintain communications with our franchisees through periodic system wide meetings and newsletters 
franchise operations 
all franchisees are required to operate their papa john s restaurants in compliance with our policies  standards and specifications  including matters such as menu items  ingredients  materials  supplies  services  fixtures  furnishings  decor and signs 
each franchisee has full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to its customers 
franchise advisory council 
we have a franchise advisory council that consists of company and franchisee representatives of domestically owned restaurants 
the advisory council and subcommittees hold regular meetings to discuss new marketing ideas  operations  growth and other relevant issues 
certain franchisees are exploring the formation of a franchise association  although we are not aware of any formal action that has been taken regarding such formation at this time 
we currently communicate with  and receive input from  our franchisees in several forms  including through the company s franchise advisory council  annual operations conferences and various regional meetings conducted with franchisees throughout the year 
we are committed to communicating with  and receiving input from  our franchisees regardless of the venue or form such communications may ultimately take 
reporting and business processes 
we collect weekly and monthly sales and other operating information from papa john s franchisees 
we have agreements with substantially all papa john s domestic franchisees permitting us to debit electronically the franchisees bank accounts for substantially all payments to us including the payment of royalties  marketing fund contributions  risk management services  and purchases from our print and promotions operations and qc centers 
this system significantly reduces the resources needed to process receivables  improves cash flow and mitigates the amount of past due accounts related to these items 
franchisees generally are required to purchase and install the papa john s profit system in their restaurants see company operations point of sale technology 
industry and competition the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price  service  location and food quality  and there are many well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than papa john s 
competitors include a large number of international  national and regional restaurant chains  as well as local pizza operators 
some of our competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than us and may be better established in the markets where our restaurants are  or may be located 
based on independent third party research  the united states quick service restaurant qsr pizza category  which includes dine in  carry out and delivery  had sales of approximately billion in  of which papa john s share was reported as 
within the pizza segment of the restaurant industry  we believe our primary competitors are the international pizza chains  including pizza hut  domino s and little caesars  and several regional chains  including chains executing a take and bake concept 
a change in the pricing or other marketing strategies of one or more of our competitors could have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings 
additionally  a continued increased emphasis on carryout business by traditional casual dining restaurants  such as applebee s and outback  as well as improved quality of fresh and frozen supermarket offerings  could also have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings 
with respect to the sale of franchises  we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts 
in general  there is also active competition for management personnel and attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for our restaurants 
government regulation we  along with our franchisees  are subject to various federal  state and local laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses 
each papa john s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities  which include health  safety  sanitation  building and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
difficulties in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area 
our full service qc centers are licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes  and the operation of our trucks are subject to department of transportation regulations 
we are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations 
we are subject to federal trade commission ftc regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
several state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor franchisee relationship 
the ftc requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing prescribed information 
substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states  and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time which would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor franchisee relationship in certain respects 
the state laws often limit  among other things  the duration and scope of non competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise 
some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor franchisee relationship 
further government initiatives  such as living wage or other proposed increases in minimum wage rates  could adversely affect papa john s as well as the restaurant industry 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where franchised units are established 
trademarks our rights in our principal trademarks and service marks are a significant part of our business 
we are the owner of the federal registration of the trademark papa john s 
we have also registered pizza papa john s and design our logo  better ingredients 
better pizza 
and pizza papa john s better ingredients 
better pizza 
and design as trademarks and service marks 
we also own federal registrations for several ancillary marks  principally advertising slogans 
we have also applied to register our primary trademark  pizza papa john s and design  in more than foreign countries and the european community 
the perfect pizza trademark is also registered in the united kingdom 
we are aware of the use by other persons in certain geographical areas of names and marks which are the same as or similar to our marks 
it is our policy to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks 
employees as of december   we employed  persons  of whom approximately  were restaurant team members  were restaurant management and supervisory personnel  were corporate personnel and were qc center and support services personnel 
most restaurant team members work part time and are paid on an hourly basis 
none of our team members is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our team member relations to be excellent 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act  including information within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  the following the ability of the papa john s system to continue to open new restaurants is affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among other things  selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations  increases in food  paper  labor  utilities  insurance and employee benefits costs  negotiation of suitable lease or financing terms  constraints on permitting and construction of restaurants  higher than anticipated construction costs  and the hiring  training and retention of management and other personnel 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that system wide  papa john s will be able to meet planned growth targets  open restaurants in markets now targeted for expansion  or continue to operate in existing markets 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price  service  location and food quality  and there are many well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the papa john s system 
some of these competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than papa john s and may be better established in the markets where restaurants operated by us or our franchisees are  or may be  located 
experience has shown that a change in the pricing or other marketing or promotional strategies of one or more of our major competitors can have an adverse impact on sales and earnings of papa john s and our system wide restaurant operations 
an increase in the cost of cheese or other commodities could adversely affect the profitability of our system wide restaurant operations 
cheese costs  historically representing to of our food cost  and other commodities are subject to seasonal fluctuations  weather  availability  demand and other factors that are beyond our control 
additionally  sustained increases in fuel and utility costs could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and qc center businesses 
changes in consumer taste for example  changes in dietary preferences that could cause consumers to avoid pizza in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthful  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing restaurants could adversely affect our restaurant business 
health or disease related disruptions or consumer concerns about the commodity supply could negatively impact the availability and or cost of such commodities  thereby adversely impacting restaurant operations and our financial results 
system wide restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime 
a significant number of hourly personnel employed by our franchisees and us are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
accordingly  further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local living wage proposals will increase labor costs for our system wide operations 
additionally  labor shortages in various markets could result in higher required wage rates 
any or all of the factors listed in through potentially adversely impacting restaurant sales or costs could be especially harmful to the financial viability of franchisees in under penetrated or emerging markets 
a decline in or failure to improve financial performance for this group of franchisees could lead to unit closings at greater than anticipated levels and therefore impact contributions to marketing funds  pjfs and support services efficiencies and other system wide results 
domestically  we are dependent on sole suppliers for our cheese  pizza sauce  flour  chicken and meat toppings and our thin crust dough products 
alternative sources for these ingredients may not be available on a timely basis to supply these key ingredients or be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements 
domestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our qc centers 
accordingly  both our corporate and franchised restaurants could be harmed by any prolonged disruption in the supply of products from our qc centers 
additionally  domestic franchisees are only required to purchase proprietary spice mix and dough from our qc centers and changes in purchasing practices by domestic franchisees could adversely affect the financial results of our qc centers 
we established a captive insurance company and began the current insurance program with franchisees in over the last few years  premium rates charged to franchisees have increased significantly as a result of increased claims costs 
the captive s relatively immature claims history limits the predictive value of estimating the costs of incurred and future claims 
accordingly  the captive could continue to incur significant fluctuations in financial results as the captive provides insurance coverage to domestic franchisees 
our domestic and international operations could be negatively impacted by significant changes in international economic and political conditions 
in addition  our international operations are subject to additional factors  including currency regulations and fluctuations  cultures and consumer preferences  diverse government regulations and structures  availability and cost of land and construction  ability to source ingredients and other commodities in a cost effective manner  and differing interpretation of the obligations established in franchise agreements with international franchisees 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our operations will achieve or maintain profitability or meet planned growth rates 
our planned conversion of a majority of perfect pizza restaurants to papa john s restaurants represents the first time we have attempted to expand the papa john s brand in this manner 
there can be no assurance that all conversion issues will be identified and successfully addressed in a timely  cost effective manner or that the existing perfect pizza market share can be successfully converted to papa john s

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction papa john s international  inc referred to as the company  papa john s or in the first person notations of we  us and our began operations in with the opening of the first papa john s restaurant in jeffersonville  indiana 
at december   there were  papa john s restaurants in operation  consisting of company owned and  franchised  and franchised perfect pizza restaurants in the united kingdom 
our revenues are principally derived from retail sales of pizza to the general public by company owned restaurants  franchise royalties  sales of franchise and development rights  sales to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items  risk management services  and information systems and related services used in their operations 
new unit openings in were as compared to in and in several factors have resulted in reduced unit openings during the past three years  including the competitive sales environment  operating margin pressures due to increased wages  insurance and other costs and the overall economic environment including franchisees access to capital 
the rate of future unit expansion will also be impacted by these and other factors 
unit closings in were as compared to in and in the closings during the past three years were due to many of the same factors impacting unit openings and the rate of future closings will also be impacted by these and other factors 
we have continued to produce strong average sales from our company owned restaurants even with a very competitive market environment 
our expansion strategy is to cluster restaurants in targeted markets  thereby increasing consumer awareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational  distribution and advertising efficiencies 
average sales for our most recent quarter s comparable base restaurants decreased to  for  from  for and as compared to  for average sales volumes in new markets are generally lower than in those markets in which we have established a significant market position 
the comparable annual sales for company owned restaurants decreased in  increased in and decreased in we believe the cumulative decrease in comparable sales over the last three years is the result of an increased competitive market 
we continually strive to obtain high quality sites with good access and visibility  and to enhance the appearance and quality of our restaurants 
we believe that these factors improve our image and brand awareness 
the average cash investment for the restaurants in our most recent comparable sales base is  the average cash investment for the ten domestic company owned restaurants opened during  exclusive of land  decreased to approximately  from  for the ten units opened in we expect the average cash investment for restaurants opening in to be approximately  approximately of our revenues for and and for were derived from the sale to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items  risk management services and information systems equipment and software and related services by us  our commissary subsidiary  pj food service  inc pjfs  our support services subsidiary  papa john s support services  inc  our insurance subsidiaries  rsc insurance services  ltd 
and risk services corp 
and our united kingdom subsidiary  papa john s uk 
we believe that  in addition to supporting both company and franchised growth  these subsidiaries contribute to product quality and consistency and restaurant profitability throughout the papa john s system 
our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in december of each year 
all fiscal years presented consist of weeks 
restaurant initiatives the company announced several restaurant initiatives throughout and  including certain system wide quality initiatives  increases in general manager and assistant manager base pay and incentive pay potential  increased restaurant staffing levels  a realignment of the field management structure for company owned restaurants and a system wide initiative to increase portions for several core pizza products 
during we saw improved operational trends as a result of these initiatives  including reduced turnover at the general manager and assistant manager positions  and improved product quality and consistency 
however  during most of  the improvements did not translate into increased sales as the overall restaurant industry  the pizza category and the economy continued to produce a very challenging environment 
according to industry sources  customer traffic count was relatively flat or declined in the qsr pizza segment for the latest reported seven consecutive quarters  with data for the most recent september october november quarter indicating a decline in transactions for the segment 
although the current industry and overall economic environment continue to be challenging  we are encouraged by our recently reported results four of the last five reported periods october through february have realized increases in comparable sales 
the system wide cost of these initiatives  when combined with the declining comparable sales trends in  negatively impacted operating margins for both company owned and franchise restaurants 
the company has begun initiatives  such as focusing on procurement  administrative and marketing costs to identify opportunities for improving restaurant operating margins 
additionally  we employed a new chief marketing officer in december we believe the anticipated and realized success of these initiatives will encourage new unit development and reduce future unit closings 
accordingly  annual net unit percentage growth could return to the mid single digits over the next few years 
further  the combination of net unit growth  a return to consistent low single digit percentage increases in comparable sales  improved restaurant operating margins and flat to increasing levels of free cash flow could result in annual earnings per share percentage growth in the low double digits over the next few years 
results of operations and critical accounting policies and estimates the results of operations are based on the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes in assumptions and or conditions in our critical accounting policies could materially impact the operating results 
we have identified the following accounting policies and related judgments as critical to understanding the results of our operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts and notes receivable based on overall receivable aging levels and a specific evaluation of accounts and notes for franchisees with known financial difficulties 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if the identified franchisees continue to experience deteriorating financial results 
long lived and intangible assets the recoverability of long lived and intangible ie  goodwill assets is evaluated annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
indicators of impairment include historical financial performance  operating trends and our future operating plans 
if impairment indicators exist  we evaluate the recoverability of long lived and intangible assets based on forecasted undiscounted cash flows 
the estimation of future cash flows requires management s judgment concerning future operations  economic growth in local or regional markets and the impact of competition 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgments in applying these factors to the analysis of long lived and intangible asset impairment 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that additional impairment charges may occur 
the company s restaurant operating profitability declined significantly during primarily as a result of negative sales trends  coupled with increasing costs  both as a result of management initiatives eg  across the board salary increases for restaurant general managers and assistant managers and outside factors eg  health care and insurance costs 
during  we recorded charges of million to reflect the impairment of domestic restaurants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
insurance reserves our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  owned and non owned automobiles and health insurance coverage provided to our employees  and the captive insurance program provided to our franchisees are self insured up to certain individual and aggregate reinsurance levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate retained liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial projections and our claims loss experience 
the estimated insurance claims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims significantly differ from historical trends used to estimate the insurance reserves recorded by the company 
in  we recorded a million increase in existing claims loss reserves  as compared to expected claims costs  at our captive insurance company  based on updated actuarial valuations

compared to revenues 
total revenues decreased to million in  from million in domestic company owned restaurant sales decreased to million in compared to million for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in comparable sales for domestic franchise sales decreased in to billion primarily resulting from a decrease in comparable sales for the period  partially offset by an increase in average sales volumes for franchise units not included in the comparable sales unit base 
domestic franchise royalties decreased to million from million in primarily due to the decrease in franchise sales noted above and an increase in the level of reduced royalty arrangements initiated in the comparable sales base and average weekly sales for and for domestic company owned and domestic franchised restaurants consisted of the following year ended december  year ended december  company franchise company franchise total domestic units end of year equivalent units comparable sales base units comparable sales base percentage average weekly sales comparable units average weekly sales other units average weekly sales all units domestic franchise and development fees  including approximately  recognized upon development cancellation or franchise renewal and transfer  were million in compared to million in there were domestic franchise unit openings in as compared to in domestic commissary and other sales decreased to million for from million in  primarily as a result of lower commissary sales due to lower cheese costs  and lower equipment sales in as a result of outsourcing this function in late  partially offset by an increase in revenues from insurance related services provided to our franchisees 
international revenues consist of the papa john s united kingdom operations which are denominated in british pounds sterling and converted to us dollars of total international revenues and combined revenues from operations in other international markets denominated in us dollars 
international revenues decreased to million in compared to million in  as lower company owned restaurant and commissary sales were substantially offset by a favorable exchange rate impact of million and increased royalties 
costs and expenses 
the restaurant operating margin at domestic company owned units was for compared to in  consisting of the following differences as a percent of company owned restaurant sales cost of sales was lower in primarily due to lower cheese costs  partially offset by portion increases for several core pizza products implemented during the second quarter of salaries and benefits were higher in reflecting the impact of an across the board increase in base pay for general managers and assistant managers implemented during the third quarter of  the loss of leverage on fixed salaries due to the decrease in average unit sales and increased health insurance costs 
additionally  in connection with the field management realignment announced in january  we increased restaurant staffing levels and general manager and assistant manager bonus potential 
advertising and related costs were higher in primarily due to increases in national spending and lower than anticipated sales 
occupancy costs were higher in primarily as a result of increased utility and general insurance costs combined with lower sales 
other operating expenses were relatively consistent as a percentage of sales lower in 
domestic commissary and other margin was for compared to in cost of sales was of revenues in compared to in primarily due to lower food costs incurred by the commissaries principally cheese  which has a fixed dollar as opposed to a fixed percentage markup  a decrease in lower margin equipment sales and an increase in the revenues from insurance related services provided to franchisees 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of sales were relatively consistent between years 
other operating expenses increased to in from in  primarily as a result of a million increase in claims loss reserves related to the franchise insurance program  as compared to expected claims costs  and lower commissary sales certain operating costs are fixed in nature 
we established a captive insurance company and began the current insurance program with franchisees in as noted above  during  we recorded a million increase in claims loss reserves  as compared to expected claims costs  based upon the results of actuarial valuations performed throughout during  premium rates were increased substantially in an effort to sufficiently fund expected claims losses 
however  the captive s relatively immature claims history limits the predictive value of actuarial valuations with respect to ultimate claims costs 
accordingly  the captive program could continue to incur significant fluctuations in income or loss from one reporting period to another until such time as the claims history is more mature and predictable 
we will attempt to identify opportunities to reduce this volatility to the extent possible and will continue to evaluate this program for the benefit of franchisees 
international operating margin decreased to in from in primarily due to lower margins and increased distribution costs associated with the uk commissary operation 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues for as compared to million or of revenues in the primary components of the million decrease are the previously mentioned restaurant field management realignment  which eliminated a layer of management previously included in g a  and a reduction in corporate and restaurant field management bonuses 
these reductions more than offset the incremental costs incurred in related to the implementation of certain restaurant quality initiatives  intended to better evaluate and monitor the quality and consistency of the customer experience  and consulting fees associated with recent initiatives to identify opportunities for improving restaurant operating margins 
a provision for uncollectible notes receivable of million was recorded in  based on our evaluation of our franchise loan portfolio  and primarily relates to specific loans for which certain scheduled payments have been deferred as part of an overall workout arrangement 
the provision for uncollectible notes receivable was million in the net restaurant closure  impairment and disposition charge was million representing million for domestic closed restaurants and million for impaired domestic restaurants  partially offset by a  gain on the sale of seven uk restaurants 
the net restaurant closure  impairment and disposition charge was million representing  for closed restaurants   for two impaired restaurants and a loss of  for disposed of units 
other general expenses were million in  as compared to million in the amount includes  of pre opening costs   of relocation costs  million provision for uncollectible franchisee accounts receivable  million of disposition related costs of other assets  million for a contribution to the papa john s marketing fund to assist the system with costs incurred for national advertising and a  sales incentive program offered to our franchisees 
these expenses were partially offset by million of income derived from the settlement of a legal matter during the second quarter of the amount includes pre opening costs of  relocation costs of  million of disposition related costs of other assets   of costs we agreed to bear in connection with a refurbishment plan concerning our heated delivery bag systems and million of losses related to a terminated vendor contract 
depreciation and amortization was million of revenues for  as compared to million of revenues for net interest 
net interest expense was million for as compared to million in as the lower outstanding debt balance and lower effective interest rate on debt were partially offset by lower interest income from investments and franchise notes receivable in income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for both and operating income and earnings per common share 
operating income in was million  or of total revenues  compared to million  or of total revenues in the decrease in operating income is primarily due to the decrease in operating results of our domestic restaurant segment  primarily resulting from lower sales and increased costs associated with our restaurant initiatives  compared to the same periods in  increases in restaurant closure  impairment and disposition charges and the increased claims loss reserves related to the franchise captive insurance program 
diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for was compared to in in december  we began a repurchase program for our common stock 
through december   an aggregate of million had been repurchased representing million shares or approximately of shares outstanding at the time the repurchase program was initiated  at an average price of per share 
the repurchase of our common shares in and resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately in as compared to compared to revenues 
total revenues decreased to million in  from million in domestic company owned restaurant sales decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of equivalent company owned units open in as compared to as a result of the sale or closure of company owned units the divested restaurants having lower than average sales 
equivalent units represents the number of restaurants open at the beginning of a given period  adjusted for restaurants opened  closed  acquired or sold during the period on a weighted average basis 
this decrease is partially offset by a increase in comparable sales for the period 
domestic franchise sales increased to billion in  from billion in this increase primarily resulted from a increase in the number of equivalent franchised domestic restaurants open in compared to  partially offset by a comparable sales decrease in domestic franchise royalties increased to million in  from million in  due to the increase in domestic franchise sales noted above

international revenues consist of the papa john s uk operations which are denominated in british pounds sterling and converted to us dollars of total international revenues and combined revenues from operations in eight other international markets denominated in us dollars

in  operating income would have been million  or of total revenues  and diluted earnings per share would have been in the decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales as compared to the pro forma percentage is primarily due to increased general and administrative and other general expenses  partially offset by an increased restaurant operating margin 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations decreased to million in compared to million in primarily reflecting our reduced restaurant sales volumes and operating margins for cash flow from operations was relatively consistent at million in compared to million in  as unfavorable changes in inventory levels  due primarily to heated delivery bags  and deferred income taxes were substantially offset by favorable changes in accrued expenses  due primarily to insurance claims reserves  and other components of working capital 
we have a revolving line of credit facility  which allows us to borrow up to million with an expiration date in january outstanding balances for the line of credit accrue interest at to basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor or other bank developed rates at our option 
the commitment fee on the unused balance ranges from to basis points 
the increment over libor and the commitment fee are determined quarterly based upon the ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we require capital primarily for the development  acquisition and maintenance of restaurants  new or replacement qc centers and support services facilities  the enhancement of corporate systems and facilities and the funding of franchisee loans 
additionally  we began a common stock repurchase program in december during  net loan repayments on our revolving line of credit of million  common stock repurchases of million and capital expenditures of million were primarily funded by cash flow from operations  proceeds from stock option exercises and available cash and cash equivalents 
total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million  about one half of which is for the development  relocation or remodeling of restaurants  including routine replacement of equipment  and about one half of which is for qc centers  support services and corporate requirements 
during  we plan to relocate the raleigh  north carolina commissary and open approximately six new domestic company owned restaurants 
as of december   we had loans to franchisees of million including a loan to the marketing fund of million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
we do not have any additional loan funding commitments related to existing franchisee loans at december  we do not plan to extend loans of any significance to franchisees in the future 
the board of directors has authorized up to million for the share repurchase program through december  at december   a total of million shares have been repurchased for million at an average price of per share since the repurchase program started in approximately  shares in  million shares in  million shares in  million shares in and million shares in 
subsequent to year end through march   we acquired an additional  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of march   approximately million of common stock remains available for repurchase under this authorization 
we expect to fund the planned capital expenditures and any additional share repurchases for the next twelve months from operating cash flow and remaining availability under our line of credit  reduced for certain outstanding letters of credit amounting to million 
our debt  which is primarily due to the share repurchase program  was million at december   compared to million at december  contractual obligations and payments as of december  due by year are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total contractual obligations long term debt revolving line of credit total debt operating leases total contractual obligations excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet related to our interest rate swap that hedges against the effects of rising interest rates on forecasted future borrowings

such commitments include the following by year in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years after years total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to contractual and other commitments 
impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs  particularly commodities  labor  benefits  insurance  utilities and fuel  could have a significant impact on us 
forward looking statements certain information contained in this annual report  particularly information regarding future financial performance and plans and objectives of management  is forward looking 
certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to the uncertainties associated with litigation  increases in projected claims losses for the company s self insured coverage or within the captive franchise insurance program  increases in advertising promotions and discounting by competitors which may adversely affect sales  new product and concept developments by food industry competitors  the ability of the company and its franchisees to open new restaurants and operate new and existing restaurants profitably  increases in food  labor  utilities  fuel  employee benefits  insurance and similar costs  the ability to obtain ingredients from alternative suppliers if needed  health or disease related disruptions or consumer concerns about the commodity supply  economic and political and health conditions in the countries in which the company or its franchisees operate  the selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations  negotiation of suitable lease or financing terms  constraints on permitting and construction of restaurants  higher than anticipated construction costs  the hiring  training and retention of management and other personnel  changes in consumer taste  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing restaurants  federal and state laws governing such matters as wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime  and labor shortages in various markets resulting in higher required wage rates 
these factors might be especially harmful to the financial viability of franchises in under penetrated or emerging markets  leading to greater unit closings than anticipated 
our international operations are subject to additional factors  including currency regulations and fluctuations  differing cultures and consumer preferences  diverse government regulations and structures  ability to source high quality ingredients and other commodities in a cost effective manner  differing interpretation of the obligations established in franchise agreements with international franchisees  and the successful conversion of perfect pizza restaurants to papa john s restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt at december  is principally comprised of a million outstanding principal balance on the million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is variable and is based on libor plus a to basis point spread  tiered based upon debt and cash flow levels 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provides for a fixed rate of  as compared to libor  on million of floating rate debt from march to march  reducing to a notional value of million from march to march  and reducing to a notional value of million in march with an expiration date of march the effective interest rate on the line of credit  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was as of december  an increase in the present interest rate of basis points on the debt balance outstanding as of december   as mitigated by the interest rate swap  would have no impact on interest expense since the debt balance is less than million 
substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations do not have a significant impact on our operating results 
cheese costs  historically representing to of our total food cost  are subject to seasonal fluctuations  weather  availability  demand and other factors that are beyond our control 
we have a purchasing arrangement with a third party entity  bibp  for the sole purpose of reducing cheese price volatility to domestic system wide restaurants 
under this arrangement  we are able to purchase cheese at a fixed price per pound throughout a given quarter  based in part on historical average cheese prices 
gains and losses incurred by the selling entity are used as a factor in determining adjustments to the selling price over time 
as a result  for any given quarter  the established price paid by the company may be less than or greater than the prevailing average market price 
over the long term  we expect to purchase cheese at a price approximating the actual average market price  with less short term volatility 
however  actual cheese market price volatility may significantly impact our operating results beginning in as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective as of year end requiring the consolidation of bibp 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the average quarterly block market price and the equivalent block market price paid by papa john s through purchases by bibp by quarter for  and are as follows block market price price paid by papa john s quarter quarter quarter quarter full year we do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  in part because of the purchasing arrangement with bibp
