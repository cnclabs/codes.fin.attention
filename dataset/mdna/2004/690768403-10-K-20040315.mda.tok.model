the notes were sold at a discount of approximately million british pounds sterling 
the resulting loss of us million us million after tax was included in the results of operations of the second quarter of capacity curtailments over the last several years  the company has significantly improved its overall worldwide glass container labor and machine productivity  as measured by output produced per man hour 
by applying its technology and worldwide best practices  the company has been able to significantly increase the daily output of glass forming machines 
as a result of these increases in productivity  the company has had to close glass plants in order to keep its capacity in balance with required production volumes 
in august  the company announced the permanent closing of its hayward  california glass container factory 
production at the factory was suspended in june following a major leak in its only glass furnace 
as a result  the company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of million million after tax in other costs and expenses in the results of operations for the closing of this factory resulted in the elimination of approximately jobs and a corresponding reduction in the company s workforce 
the company expects to save approximately million per year by closing this factory and moving the production to other locations 
the company anticipates that it will pay out approximately million in cash related to severance  benefits  lease commitments  plant clean up  and other plant closing costs 
the company expects that a substantial portion of these costs will be paid out by the end of in november  the company announced the permanent closing of its milton  ontario glass container factory 
the closing of this factory is part of the company s previously announced capacity utilization review 
this closing is part of an effort to bring capacity and inventory levels in line with anticipated demand 
as a result  the company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of million million after tax in other costs and expenses in the results of operations for the closing of this factory in november resulted in the elimination of approximately jobs and a corresponding reduction in the company s workforce 
the company eventually expects to save approximately million per year by closing this factory and moving the production to other locations

the company expects that the majority of these costs will be paid out by the end of in december  the company announced the permanent closing of its perth  australia glass container factory 
the closing of this factory is part of the company s previously announced capacity utilization review 
this closing is part of an effort to reduce overall capacity in australia and bring inventory levels in line with anticipated demand 
the perth plant s western location and small size contributed to the plant being a higher cost facility that was no longer economically feasible to operate 
as a result  the company recorded a capacity curtailment charge of million million after tax in other costs and expenses in the results of operations for the closing of this factory in december resulted in the elimination of approximately jobs and a corresponding reduction in the company s workforce 
the company expects to save approximately million per year by closing this factory and eventually moving the production to other locations 
the company anticipates that it will pay out approximately million in cash related to severance  benefits  plant clean up  and other plant closing costs 
the company expects that the majority of these costs will be paid out by third quarter of the operating results included pretax charges of million related to the following charges of million principally related to a restructuring program and impairment at certain of the company s international and domestic operations 
the charge included the impairment of assets at the company s affiliate in puerto rico and the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and the closing of a facility in venezuela 
the program also included consolidation of capacity at certain other international and domestic facilities in response to decisions about pricing and market strategy and a charge of million related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business

the company s decision to sell its assets related to the production of plastic trigger sprayers and finger pumps is consistent with its objectives to improve liquidity and to focus on its core businesses 
plastics packaging assets in august of  the company initiated a review of its plastics packaging assets in the asia pacific region 
the review was completed during the fourth quarter of the company used a combination of estimated divestment cash flows  which included bid prices from potential purchasers  and partial liquidation values for certain assets to determine the net realizable values of the assets 
the company compared the estimated net realizable values to the book values of the asset and determined that an asset impairment existed 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million million after tax to write down the assets to realizable values 
certain of the plastics businesses in the asia pacific region operate in highly competitive markets leading to reduced profit margins 
in addition  the company s pet container business has lost a significant amount of business in the past few years 
the reduced business and overall excess capacity in the industry has caused a reduction in the overall value of the business 
the company has entered into an agreement to sell a significant portion of its asia pacific plastic business for approximately million excluding pet container operations 
the sale of this business is subject to certain regulatory and other approvals 
impairment of goodwill and write down of equity investment during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that an impairment existed in the goodwill of its consumer products reporting unit 
the consumer products unit operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
during the course of  a number of the product lines within this reporting unit experienced price reductions  principally as a result of the company s strategy to preserve and expand market share 
the reduced pricing  along with continued capital expenditures  caused the company to lower its earnings and cash flow projections for the consumer products reporting unit for several years following the measurement date october  resulting in an estimated fair value for the unit that was lower than its book value 
following a review of the valuation of the unit s identifiable assets  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  the company also determined that the value of its investment in a north american soda ash mining operation was impaired and not likely to recover 
increasing global competition and recent development of foreign sources of soda ash have created significant excess capacity in that industry 
the resulting competitive environment caused management of the soda ash mining operation to significantly lower its projections of earnings and cash flows 
following an evaluation of future estimated earnings and cash flows  the company determined that its carrying value should be written down to estimated fair value and recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter which substantially reduced the carrying value of this equity method investment 
asbestos related costs the charge for asbestos related costs of million million after tax  recorded in the fourth quarter of  represented an increase in the accrued liability for estimated future asbestos related costs 
following the completion of a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed in the next several years 
asbestos related cash payments for were million  a reduction of million  or  from during  the company disposed of approximately  claims 
certain dispositions in and prior years have included deferred amounts payable over periods ranging up to seven years 
deferred amounts payable at december  were approximately million compared with approximately million at december  the company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other sources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations on a short term and long term basis 
as of december   the number of asbestos related claims pending against the company was approximately  up from approximately  pending claims at december  in the second quarter of  the company received approximately  new filings in advance of the effective date of the recently enacted mississippi tort reform law 
approximately of those filings are cases with exposure dates after the company s exit from the business for which the company takes the position that it has no liability 
a former business unit of the company produced a minor amount of specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from until  when the business was sold 
in line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over years ago  the company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and will continue to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the company s products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
pending acquisition on february   the company announced that it has entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire bsn glasspack  sa  the second largest glass container manufacturer in europe  from glasspack participations  a company controlled by investment funds advised by cvc capital partners europe 
total consideration for the acquisition would be approximately  million euros us  million in cash  including the assumption of approximately million of debt 
the company is currently in negotiations with its lenders in order to amend the secured credit agreement to allow additional borrowings to fund the balance of the total consideration and provide for seasonal working capital needs 
bsn has successfully concluded consultations with the appropriate employee workers councils in accordance with applicable labor laws 
the acquisition would be subject to regulatory approval  with the closing expected in the second quarter of bsn owns and operates plants located in france  germany  the netherlands and spain  principally serving the wine and spirits  other beverages including beer  and specialty food industries 
based on sales  the acquisition of bsn would have increased the company s glass container sales approximately 
after the acquisition is completed  the company will have approximately billion of additional debt outstanding and its interest expense will increase accordingly 
however  the company expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first year  before synergies 
capital resources and liquidity current and long term debt the company s total debt at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  the increase in the total debt from to was primarily the result of reduced cash provided by operating activities  principally working capital  as discussed further below 
on june   the company s subsidiary borrowers entered into an amended and restated secured credit agreement the agreement which provides for up to billion of borrowings 
the agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million a term loan  each of which has a final maturity date of april   and an million b term loan  which has a final maturity date of april  proceeds from borrowings under the agreement were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the company s billion previous credit agreement which had been scheduled to mature on march  at december   the company had available credit totaling billion under the agreement  of which million had not been utilized 
during may  a subsidiary of the company issued senior secured notes totaling million and senior notes totaling million 
the notes bear interest at and  respectively  and are due may  and may   respectively 
both series of notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
in addition  the assets of substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the senior secured notes 
the indentures for the senior secured notes and the senior notes have substantially the same restrictions as the previously issued and senior secured notes 
the issuing subsidiary used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately million to purchase in a tender offer million of the million senior notes due and repay borrowings under the previous credit agreement 
concurrently  available credit under the previous credit agreement was reduced to approximately billion 
as part of the issuance of these notes and the related tender offer  the company recorded in the second quarter of additional interest charges of million for note repurchase premiums and the related write off of unamortized finance fees and million for the write off of unamortized finance fees related to the reduction of available credit under the previous credit agreement 
the senior secured notes totaling billion and senior notes totaling million that were issued during and were part of the company s plan to improve financial flexibility by issuing long term fixed rate debt 
while this strategy extended the maturity of the company s debt  long term fixed rate debt increases the cost of borrowing compared to shorter term  variable rate debt 
the agreement contains covenants and provisions that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments  pay dividends  create liens on assets  enter into contingent obligations  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  change the business conducted  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities 
in addition  the agreement contains financial covenants that require the company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified tests based upon financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  maximum leverage ratios  minimum net worth and specified capital expenditure tests 
the company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available under the agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs  debt service and other obligations on a short term and long term basis 
cash flows for the year ended december   the company paid million in cash interest compared with million for the increase in cash interest paid is due in part to the issuance of the senior secured and senior notes discussed above 
the increase is also due to overall higher levels of debt 
these increases were partially offset by lower overall interest rates on the company s variable rate debt borrowed under the agreement 
the company expects that the effects of additional higher cost fixed rate debt will add approximately million to interest expense for full year of compared to the full year of as discussed further below  the company has implemented an ongoing program to swap up to billion of fixed rate debt into floating rate debt 
the company expects that this program will save approximately million in cash interest paid during following the expected acquisition of bsn  the company s cash interest payments will increase substantially as a result of the additional borrowings and assumed debt 
the amount of such additional payments will depend partially on future interest rates  however  based on rates in effect at the end of  the company expects cash interest payments to increase by approximately million on an annual basis 
asbestos related payments for decreased million  or  to million  compared with million for the company expects that its total asbestos related payments in will be moderately lower than based on the company s expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the company s expected operating cash flow  the company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims  and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos  will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity on a short term or long term basis 
for  cash provided by operating activities was million compared with million for the decrease is due in part to an overall increase in working capital 
the increase in working capital is partially due to an increase in inventories in domestic glass container operations partially due to lower shipments 
inventory levels in domestic plastic containers and the australian glass container operations were also higher  as compared to the prior year 
an increase in accounts receivable for certain european affiliates and for the company s affiliate in brazil was the result of increased sales 
cash flow in also lacks the benefit of a significant collection of past due accounts receivable from the canadian acquisition which were collected in during  the company is continuing its focus on reducing inventory levels around the world and reducing accounts receivable balances by vigorously pursing past due receivables 
for  the company s capital spending for additions to property  plant and equipment was million compared with million for the company continues to focus on reducing capital spending and improving its return on capital invested by improving capital efficiency 
the company expects to reduce its capital spending on existing facilities during by limiting the number of expansion projects and only undertaking projects with relatively short payback periods 
on july   the company received payments totaling million british pounds sterling us million in connection with the sale to ardagh glass limited of certain long term notes receivable as discussed further above 
the proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the agreement 
for  the company received million from divestitures and other asset sales compared with million in included in was approximately million from the divestiture of certain closures assets as discussed above 
the company has retained advisors to conduct a strategic review of certain of its blow molded plastics operations in north america  south america and europe 
the review may result in the divestiture of portions of this business that do not meet the company s overall strategic plans 
for  the company paid million in finance fees related to the issuance of the senior secured and senior notes discussed above as well as the refinancing of the agreement 
the company paid million in for the issuance of senior secured notes 
during  the company also paid and expensed million of tender offer premiums 
for  the company paid million related to debt hedging activity compared to million in as discussed further below  the company s strategy is to use currency and interest rate swaps to convert us dollar borrowings by the company s international subsidiaries  principally in australia  into local currency borrowings 
during  as a result of the us dollar s decline against several foreign currencies  including the australian dollar and the canadian dollar  the company paid significant amounts to settle these swaps at their maturity 
the increase from prior year is largely due to a significantly larger decline in the us dollar against the foreign currencies 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following information summarizes the company s significant contractual cash obligations at december  millions of dollars 
payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years contractual cash obligations long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases pension benefit plan contributions postretirement benefit plan benefit payments total contractual cash obligations  amount of commitment expiration per period total less than one year years years more than years other commercial commitments standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments at december  and  the company had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting estimates the company s analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to pension benefit plans  contingencies and litigation  goodwill  and deferred tax assets 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where estimates and assumptions affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
the company believes that accounting for pension benefit plans  contingencies and litigation  goodwill  and deferred tax assets involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
pension benefit plans because of their historically well funded status  the company s principal defined benefit pension plans contributed pretax credits to earnings of approximately million for and approximately million for the decrease in pretax pension credits is attributed to several factors discussed below 
the determination of pension obligations and the related pension credits involves significant estimates 
the most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the pension credits for the year 
the company uses discount rates based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year 
at december   the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 
the company uses an expected long term rate of return on assets that is based on both past performance of the various plans assets and estimated future performance of the assets 
past performance of the company s pension plan assets has been particularly volatile in the last four years 
investment returns exceeded during but were negative in each of the years the company refers to average historical returns over longer periods up to years in setting its rates of return because short term fluctuations in market value do not reflect the rates of return the company expects to achieve based upon its long term investing strategy 
for  the company reduced its assumed rate of return on pension assets to a weighted average expected long term rate of approximately  compared to for the year ended december  the lower assumed rate  combined with a lower asset base  contributed to the lower pretax credits to earnings in because of the amortization of previous losses and generally lower discount rates  the company expects credits to earnings in to be less than million  compared with credits to earnings of million in future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance 
for example  a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately million in pretax pension credits for the full year in addition  changes in external factors  including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rates used to calculate plan liabilities  could result in possible future balance sheet recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities 
if the accumulated benefit obligation abo of the company s principal pension plans in the us and australia exceeds the fair value of their assets at the next measurement date of december   the company will be required to write off the related prepaid pension asset and record a liability equal to the excess of the abo over the fair value of the assets 
the noncash charge would result in a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of share owners equity that would significantly reduce net worth 
amounts related to the company s us and australian plans as of december  are as follows millions of dollars us salary us hourly australian plans total fair value of assets   accumulated benefit obligations   excess prepaid pension asset even if the fair values of the us plans assets are less than abo at december   however  the company believes it will not be required to make cash contributions to the us plans for at least several years 
contingencies and litigation the company believes that its ultimate asbestos related liability ie  its indemnity payments or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the company s ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the united states  the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards  the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits  the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure  and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy 
the company believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims  which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years 
the company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the company 
the company completed a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs in connection with finalizing and reporting its results for  and expects to conduct a comprehensive review annually thereafter  unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review 
if the results of the annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated costs  then the company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrued liability 
following the completion of its comprehensive review during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that an increase in the accrued liability was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims pending and expected to be filed in the next several years 
the resulting charge of million million after tax was reflected in the results of operations for the fourth quarter of the company s estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill as required by fas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  the company evaluates goodwill annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
the company conducts its evaluation as of october of each year 
goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value bev of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
this bev is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment exists 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment testing and determined that an impairment existed in the goodwill of its consumer products reporting unit 
the consumer products unit operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
during the course of  a number of the product lines within this reporting unit experienced price reductions  principally as a result of the company s strategy to preserve and expand market share 
the reduced pricing  along with continued capital investment requirements  caused the company to lower its earnings and cash flow projections for the consumer products reporting unit for several years following the measurement date  which resulted in a lower bev 
following a review of the valuation of the unit s identifiable assets  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the reported value of its goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  the company also determined that the value of its investment in a north american soda ash mining operation was impaired and not likely to recover 
increasing global competition and recent development of foreign sources of soda ash have created significant excess capacity in that industry 
the resulting competitive environment caused management of the soda ash mining operation to significantly lower its projections of earnings and cash flows 
following an evaluation of future estimated earnings and cash flows  the company determined that its carrying value should be written down to estimated fair value and recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter which substantially reduced the carrying value of this equity method investment 
if the company s projected debt free  after tax cash flows were substantially lower  or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were substantially higher  the testing performed as of october   may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the company s other reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would also have been written down 
however  based on the company s testing as of that date  modest changes in the projected cash flows or cost of capital would not have created impairment in other reporting units 
for example  if projected debt free  after tax cash flows had been decreased by  or alternatively if the weighted average cost of capital had been increased by  the resulting lower bev s would still have exceeded the book value of each reporting unit by a significant margin in all cases except for the asia pacific glass reporting unit 
because the bev for the asia pacific glass reporting unit exceeded its book value by approximately  the results of the impairment testing could be negatively affected by relatively modest changes in the assumptions and projections 
at december   the goodwill of the asia pacific glass reporting unit accounted for approximately million of the company s consolidated goodwill 
the company will monitor conditions throughout that might significantly affect the projections and variables used in the impairment test to determine if a review prior to october may be appropriate 
if the results of impairment testing confirm that a write down of goodwill is necessary  then the company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of  or earlier if appropriate 
in the event the company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill  the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth 
deferred tax assets fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses 
in the united states  the company has recorded significant deferred tax assets  the largest of which relate to the accrued liability for asbestos related costs that are not deductible until paid and to its net operating loss carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities  the most significant of which relates to the prepaid pension balance 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance for its us tax credit carryforwards  however  it has not recorded a valuation allowance for the balance of its net us deferred tax assets 
the company believes that its projected taxable income in the us  along with a number of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  will be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses prior to their expiration 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient income from its us operations or implement the required tax planning strategies  or if the company is required to eliminate deferred tax liabilities in connection with a write off of its pension balance  then a valuation allowance will have to be provided 
it is not possible to estimate the amount of the adjustment that may be required  however  based on recorded deferred taxes at december   the related non cash tax charge could range from approximately million to million 
the company will assess the need to provide a valuation allowance annually or more frequently  if necessary 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying existing statutory tax rates to the temporary differences between amounts reported in the financial statements and those reported in the tax return and to the pretax amount of loss carryforwards 
during  legislation was proposed in the us that would  among other things  reduce the rate of tax on corporate income 
if such legislation is enacted  the company will be required to revalue its deferred tax assets and liabilities using lower rates 
because the deferred tax accounts are in a net asset position  the result would be a charge to earnings through an increase in the provision for taxes 
based on the company s us net deferred tax asset position at december   a decrease in the corporate income tax rate would require an increase in the tax provision of approximately million 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in interest rates  and changes in commodity prices  principally natural gas 
the company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating natural gas prices 
in addition  the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of fixed and floating rate debt and to reduce interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions 
the primary foreign markets served by the company s subsidiaries are in canada  australia  south america principally colombia  brazil and venezuela  and europe principally italy  the united kingdom  and poland 
in general  revenues earned and costs incurred by the company s major foreign affiliates are denominated in their respective local currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company s subsidiaries operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the reported dollar value of local currency earnings generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency earnings generally increases 
the company does not have any significant foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the us dollar  however  if economic conditions in venezuela continue to decline  the company may have to adopt the us dollar as its functional currency for its subsidiaries in that country 
subject to other business and tax considerations  the company s strategy is to generally redeploy any subsidiary s available excess funds through intercompany loans to other subsidiaries for debt repayment  capital investment  or other cash requirements 
each intercompany loan is denominated in the lender s local currency and the borrower enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency 
because the company s subsidiaries operate within their local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable where debt financing is required 
considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
in those countries where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  however  local currency borrowings expose the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
the company s subsidiaries in australia  canada  the united kingdom and several other european countries have also entered into short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap additional intercompany and external borrowings at each subsidiary into its local currency 
the company s secured credit agreement requires that all borrowings  other than borrowings under certain limited overdraft facilities  be denominated in us dollars 
as of december   the us dollar amounts outstanding under the agreement borrowed by the company s foreign subsidiary in australia were million 
a significant portion of the above australian borrowings and the intercompany loans have been swapped into local currencies using currency swaps 
the company accounts for these swaps as fair value hedges 
as a result  the changes in the value of the swaps are included in other expense and are expected to substantially offset any exchange rate gains or losses on the related us dollar borrowings 
during the second quarter of  the company s subsidiary in australia entered into a number of agreements that swap a total of us million of borrowings into  million australian dollars 
these derivative instruments swap both the interest and principal from us dollars to australian dollars and also swap the interest rate from a us based rate to an australian based rate 
these agreements have various maturity dates ranging from april through may the remaining portion of the company s consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant 
the company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to local currency denominated financial instruments ie cash  short term investments  and long term debt of its subsidiaries outside the us interest rate risk the company s interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates applicable to its us dollar indebtedness 
the following table provides information about the company s significant interest rate risk at december  amount fair value hedge value millions of dollars variable rate debt secured credit agreement  matures march term loans  interest at a eurodollar based rate plus a term loan b term loan fixed rate debt senior secured notes  due    due  due senior notes  due  due  due  due  due senior debentures  due  due interest rate swap agreements in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million that mature from through the swaps were executed in order to i convert a portion of the senior notes and senior debentures fixed rate debt into floating rate debt  ii maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt  and iii reduce net interest payments and expense in the near term 
the company s fixed to variable interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges 
because the relevant terms of the swap agreements match the corresponding terms of the notes  there is no hedge ineffectiveness 
accordingly  as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
the company recorded the fair market values of the swaps as a net non current liability of millon along with a corresponding net decrease to the hedged debt 
under the swaps the company receives fixed rate interest amounts equal to interest on the corresponding hedged note and pays interest at a six month us libor rate set in arrears plus a margin spread see table below 
the interest rate differential on each swap is recognized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the agreement 
the following selected information relates to fair value swaps at december  based on a projected us libor rate of amount hedged average receive rate average spread asset liability recorded dollars in millions senior notes due senior notes due senior debentures due total commodity risk the company is exposed to fluctuations of various commodity prices  most significantly the changes in prices of natural gas 
the company purchases a significant amount of natural gas at nationally quoted market prices 
the company uses commodity futures contracts related to a portion of its forecasted natural gas requirements 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid for natural gas and the potential volatility in earnings or cash flows from future market price movements 
the company continually evaluates the natural gas market with respect to its future usage requirements 
the company generally evaluates the natural gas market for the next twelve to eighteen months and continually enters into commodity futures contracts in order to hedge a portion of its usage requirements through the next twelve to eighteen months 
at december   the company had entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately approximately  mm btus of its expected north american natural gas usage for the full year of the company accounts for the above futures contracts on the balance sheet at fair value 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as  and meets the required criteria for  a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized in current earnings 
the above futures contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges at december  hedge accounting is only applied when the derivative is deemed to be highly effective at offsetting anticipated cash flows of the hedged transactions 
for hedged forecasted transactions  hedge accounting will be discontinued if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable to occur  and any previously deferred gains or losses will be recorded to earnings immediately 
at december   an unrealized net gain of million  after tax of million  related to these commodity futures contracts was included in oci 
there was no ineffectiveness recognized during the years ended december  and forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and section a of the securities act of forward looking statements reflect the company s current expectations and projections about future events at the time  and thus involve uncertainty and risk
