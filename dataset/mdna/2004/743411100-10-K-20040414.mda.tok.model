item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the registrant s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the reorganization in june  management of prolong has concentrated a significant portion of its efforts and resources on the marketing and sale of prolong s consumer oriented products  through traditional retail distribution and through direct response television advertising 
management believes that it has attained a significant level of brand and product identification and prolong has focused its efforts to expand sales of its consumer lubrication products into commercial and industrial channels  as well as international markets 
the lubricant business is extremely competitive 
prolong s business requires that it compete with larger  better financed entities  most of which have brand names which are well established in the marketplace 
although prolong  in the opinion of management  has unique products which have superior performance characteristics relative to the well known products available in the marketplace  prolong remains at a distinct disadvantage and will be required to expend substantial sums in order to promote brand name identity and product acceptance among its prospective customers 
in order to establish brand name identity  prolong has relied primarily on its direct response television programs and intends from time to time to utilize this means to gain product recognition for purposes of directly increasing sales as well as increasing retail  commercial  industrial and governmental sales resulting from broader public knowledge of its products 
risk factors and forward looking statements this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that involve risks and uncertainties 
in addition  the company may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
the words estimate  project  potential  intended  expect  anticipate  believe and similar expressions or words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements included herein are based on current expectations  which involve a number of risks and uncertainties and assumptions regarding the company s business and technology 
these assumptions involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic and competitive conditions  and future business decisions  all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in forward looking statements will be realized and actual results may differ materially 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking information included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives or plans of the company will be achieved 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof  or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
because of the risk factors discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other factors that may affect the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory reserves  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  warranty reserves  litigation and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  forecasted operating results and expected trends  and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between the company s estimates and the actual results  its future results of operations will be affected 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require it to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue  receivables and inventory the company recognizes product revenue upon concluding that all of the fundamental criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
in addition  the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and allowances such as competitive pricing programs 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed the company s estimates  additional reductions to revenue would result 
the company provides reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
management obtains an annual independent  third party valuation of the company to assist it in the performance of annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization 
deferred taxes if the company determines that it is more likely than not that it will not realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  it will record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which allowance will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and future taxable income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
management also considers the weight of both positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is needed

 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  and sfas no 
 business combinations  and determined that the advances made to epl should have been reflected as period expenses in the period in which such advances were made and that the value of the additional shares issued of  should be reflected as a period expense in when the settlement agreement was executed

some of the statements contained in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties which may affect  among other things  our ability to maintain our current sales rate or may cause sales to decline 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following competitive  technological  financial and business challenges may make it more difficult for us to continue to sell specialty lubricant and appearance products 
we may be unable to retain our existing key sales  technical and management personnel 
increased competition in the specialized lubrication or appearance product markets may cause downward pressure on our prices 
we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 
the lubricant or appearance products industries or our operations or business may face other unforeseen material adverse changes 
we may be unable to generate either through operations  debt placements or equity sales  sufficient cash to operate the business profitably 
our current expectations  which impact our budgeting  marketing  and other management decisions  are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments 
revisions to our current expectations may cause us to change our marketing  capital expenditures or other budgets  which may in turn affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
although we believe that our current expectations are reasonable  we make no representation regarding their accuracy 
therefore  you should avoid placing undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we have incurred several years of declining sales and operating losses and may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability in the future 
we have experienced decreasing sales each year since fiscal year primarily as a result of increased competition in our market 
partly as a result of our decreased sales  we have incurred net losses of million  million  million  million and million for the fiscal years    and  respectively 
our revenues may not increase or we may not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
even if we are able to achieve profitability in the near future  we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis thereafter 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future and a failure to raise additional funds when needed may require us to curtail or suspend our operations 
we expect that our need for additional funds will increase in the future as our business grows 
however  we may not be able to obtain adequate funds when we need them or on acceptable terms  if at all 
our future need for additional funds will depend on numerous factors including the following the success of our product development programs  the commercial success of our products  the rate of growth of our business  and the availability of cash from our operations and other sources 
the issuance of additional shares of stock could result in a substantial dilution to the ownership interests of our present or future stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on terms acceptable to us when we need them  we may need to delay  scale back or suspend our product development and the manufacture of our current products 
page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries if we are unable to attract and retain our key management personnel  we may not be able to sustain our business 
we depend on our key management personnel and our future success will depend in large part upon their contributions  experience and expertise 
we currently have employment agreements with three of our senior executives 
in addition  our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel 
the loss of any key management personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified management personnel could negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan and reduce our revenues 
we may be subject to potential product liability claims which  if successful  could negatively affect our business 
the nature of our business exposes us to risk from product liability claims 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with maximum coverage limits of  for each occurrence and an aggregate limit of  per year 
product liability coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and our current coverage may not adequately cover future product liability claims 
currently  we have no plans to increase our coverage 
however  we reevaluate our product liability coverage from time to time to ensure its adequacy 
any losses that we may suffer from future liability claims  including the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon our reputation and marketability of our products  may negatively impact our customer relationships and reduce our earnings 
our industry is subject to intense competition  which may reduce the demand for our products and negatively impact our revenues 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources and greater market recognition than we do 
several of our competitors also have  or may develop or acquire  substantial customer bases in the automotive and other related industries 
as a result  our competitors may respond quicker to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote more resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
this  in turn  may reduce the demand for our products and negatively impact our revenues 
our principal competitors include other providers of specialized lubrication products  such as the clorox company stp and pennzoil quaker state corporation slick  both of which market engine treatments  and other competitive engine treatment brands  such as duralube and z max 
our competitors also include major oil brands such as shell  chevron  castrol  and other companies that manufacture lubrication products  such as wd company 
further  we believe that major oil companies  well established consumer products and new start up companies not presently offering products that compete directly with our products  may enter our markets in the future 
with respect to our appearance products  major competitors include such companies as turtle wax  inc  meguiar s  inc  mothers  pennzoil quaker state company  and the clorox company 
increased competition could result in any or all of the following price reductions  reduced gross margins  loss of market share  and loss of shelf space 
additionally  other dealers and distributors may appeal to the price sensitive segment of the market by offering similar lubrication and appearance products at prices below ours 
while we believe that our prices are competitive for the level of quality of our products  we rely on our brand name recognition and reputation for selling quality products supported by strong customer service 
our dependence on third party suppliers may affect our ability to obtain the necessary components to manufacture our products 
while we continue to work actively with each supplier in order to sustain and at times increase production page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries of our components  our suppliers may not be able to sustain or increase their production in time to satisfy our demand and we may not be able to reach acceptable terms with alternate suppliers to meet any supply deficiency 
to date  we have succeeded in obtaining enough components from existing suppliers to produce our afmt formula in order to meet our current manufacturing needs 
we also believe that adequate supplies will continue to be available in the near future 
however  if we fail to obtain enough components  or if such components fall below our quality standards  shipments and sales of our products may be delayed or reduced  which would adversely affect our customer relationships and negatively impact our revenues 
most of our revenue comes from a limited number of products and the decrease of the selling price  or demand for  any product would significantly reduce our revenue 
we currently generate substantially all of our revenues from sales of our afmt based products and we expect this trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
because our revenues are concentrated in lubricant products  a decline in the demand for  or in the prices of  our afmt based products as a result of competition  technological advances or otherwise  would have a negative impact on our revenues 
we recently contracted our appearance product line to offer a more limited product mix  which is a strategy we anticipate continuing for the foreseeable future 
there is a large number of shares of common stock that may be sold under our registration statement originally filed on january  and such sales may depress the market price of our common stock  which may negatively impact the investment value for our existing stockholders 
upon effectiveness of the registration statement originally filed on january   an additional  shares will become freely tradable without restriction 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
a significant portion of our revenues currently comes from a small number of customers  and any decrease in revenue from these customers could harm our results of operations 
a significant portion of our revenues comes from only a small number of customers 
for example  during fiscal year  four customers accounted for approximately of net revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to depend on sales to a small number of customers 
any downturn in the business from these customers could seriously harm our revenues and results of operations 
our average net selling prices have declined  and may continue to decline  which could negatively impact our gross margins and earnings 
the average net sales prices for our products has declined and may continue to decline in the future 
this decline is primarily as a result of promotional offers we have recently initiated as a result of increased competition and demand from consumers to reduce pricing 
in addition  our average net sales prices decline when we negotiate large volume price discounts with certain customers 
in the short term  we plan to work at lowering our manufacturing costs in order to offset the possibility of declining average sales prices 
in the long term  we plan to develop new afmt based products and product mixes that can be manufactured at lower cost or sold at higher average sales prices 
if  however  we fail to achieve such manufacturing cost reductions or diversify our product mix  our gross margins could decline 
such a decline could negatively impact our earnings 
our revenues could be diminished if we are not able to expand our international sales 
international sales comprised of revenues during fiscal year as compared to of revenues for fiscal year we plan to continue to expand international sales in the future 
this will require significant financial resources and management attention 
in order to expand sales internationally  we plan to do the following establish additional marketing and sales operations  recruit additional international distributors  and invest in international protection of our trademarks 
to the extent we fail to do any of the above  our growth may suffer and our revenues will be negatively impacted 
page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries our international operations subject us to additional business risks  such as compliance with foreign regulation  increased costs and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and may negatively impact our results of operations 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs of localizing products in foreign countries  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing foreign operations  potential for adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating our earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws political and economic instability  and currency crisis in foreign countries that interrupt or terminate the ability of our international customers to settle their accounts in us dollars 
additionally  our worldwide sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would make our products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those markets 
the realization of one or more of the foregoing risks relating to our international operations could negatively impact our earnings 
we could be subject to environmental liabilities or regulatory compliance costs  which may cause us to curtail or suspend our operations 
federal  state and local regulations impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of substances we use in the manufacture of our products and on our facilities 
we have registered our fuel conditioners with the united states environmental protection agency  or the epa 
such epa registrations have no term but require us to notify the epa of any changes in the chemical composition of such conditioners or other information contained in such registration 
we are unaware of any additional governmental approvals required for our products 
we are also unaware of any existing or probable governmental regulations which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we outsource our manufacturing and do not store significant quantities of our products  any direct costs incurred in complying with environmental laws have been minimal and have not materially affected our business 
we have tried to minimize our economic risk from environmental violations by our manufacturers or bottlers by locating alternative sources of such services 
we believe that our activities and those of our contract manufacturers conform to present governmental regulations that apply to each such entity s operations 
additionally  we believe that our current facilities conform to present governmental regulations relating to environmental  land use  public utility utilization and fire code matters 
government regulations could be changed to impose additional requirements on us which could restrict our ability to expand our operations or have an adverse effect on our business 
the adoption of these types of governmental regulations or our failure to comply with the applicable environmental and land use regulations or restrictions on the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liability or could cause our operations or those of our contract manufacturers to be curtailed  relocated or suspended 
if we fail to secure adequate intellectual property protection  it could significantly harm our financial results and ability to compete 
we rely on trademark  trade secret  patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be successfully asserted in the future or that they will not be invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  laws of some of the foreign countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement page prolong international corporation and subsidiaries proceedings against us could harm the value of our intellectual property rights and would negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan and may reduce our revenues 
issuances of our preferred stock may discourage companies from acquiring us and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
pursuant to the terms of our articles of incorporation  our board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock 
such issuances of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
issuing preferred stock provides flexibility with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
however  an issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our voting stock and this may not be in the best interests of some of our stockholders 
pursuant to the authority contained in our articles of incorporation  in october our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend of a right to purchase one one thousandth of a share of preferred stock for each outstanding share of our common stock 
the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our business 
this may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
other than in connection with the stockholder rights plan described above  we do not currently plan to issue any shares of our preferred stock 
if we fail to continue to meet the listing standards for the american stock exchange and become delisted  the trading price of our common stock will likely be lower and the ability of our stockholders to liquidate their shares of common stock will be negatively impacted 
the listing standards for the american stock exchange include a stockholders equity and market capitalization test 
the american stock exchange also monitors the financial condition and stability of listed companies 
as of december   we met the current listing standards with respect to stockholders equity and market capitalization 
however  in the event that we fail to satisfy the listing standards in the future  our common stock may be delisted from the american stock exchange 
if our common stock is removed from listing on the american stock exchange  the liquidity of our common stock is likely to be impaired and the trading price reduced 
our common stock price is subject to significant fluctuations and volatility and our stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid for them
