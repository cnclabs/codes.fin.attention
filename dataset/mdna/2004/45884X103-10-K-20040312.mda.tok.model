item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview intermune is an independent biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies in pulmonology and hepatology 
in  we reorganized our business by curtailing investment in non core areas and focusing our commercial and development efforts in pulmonology and hepatology 
we have a stable revenue base provided primarily by our two core marketed products  advanced stage clinical programs addressing a range of unmet medical needs with attractive potential commercial markets and several strategic non core assets that we believe provide us the opportunity to create value 
in  our total product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  substantially all of our revenues are generated from actimmune sales 
marketed products our two core marketed products are actimmune interferon gamma b  approved for the treatment of severe  malignant osteopetrosis and chronic granulomatous disease  and infergen consensus interferon alfacon  approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infections 
product development drug development in the united states is a process that includes several steps defined by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which if successful  allows for the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of clinical trials phase i  ii and iii 
in our experience  clinical development accounts for an average of seven years of a drug s total development time 
the fda may require  or companies may pursue  additional clinical trials  known as phase iv clinical trials after a product is approved 
the results of phase iv clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a drug and can provide important safety information to supplement the fda s voluntary adverse drug reaction reporting system 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are phase iii clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
it is not uncommon for a drug that appears promising in a phase ii clinical trial to fail in a more rigorous and reliable phase iii clinical trials 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to accurately predict 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to a new drug application  or nda  a biologic license application  or bla  or an nda or bla supplement  the fda may grant marketing approval ie  a license  request additional information or refuse to file the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
we have a late stage development pipeline in the areas of pulmonology and hepatology 
pulmonology in pulmonology  we are developing two therapies for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  or ipf 
ipf is a fatal disease for which there is no fda approved therapy 
we believe that there are approximately  patients with ipf in the united states 
we are developing what we believe to be the two most promising and most clinically advanced compounds for the treatment of ipf actimmune and pirfenidone 
we initiated a pivotal phase iii clinical trial of actimmune for the treatment of patients with ipf in december we have rights to develop and commercialize actimmune for a broad range of diseases in the united states  canada and japan 
we are collaborating with boehringer ingelheim international gmbh bi international  which has similar rights in europe and the rest of the world  to develop and commercialize interferon gamma b under the trade name imukin 
we expect to announce our plans regarding a clinical development program for pirfenidone in hepatology in hepatology  we are focused on expanding treatment options for patients suffering from hcv infections 
we are developing once daily infergen in combination with ribavirin therapy for the treatment of patients suffering from chronic hcv infections who have failed to respond to the current standard of care  pegylated interferon alpha in combination with ribavirin therapy 
these patients are referred to as hepatitis c nonresponders 
we believe that there are approximately  hepatitis c nonresponders in the united states  and that this patient population is growing rapidly 
we expect to initiate a phase iii trial of once daily treatment with infergen in combination with ribavirin therapy for hepatitis c nonresponders in the first half of in addition  we are developing once daily infergen in combination with actimmune for the treatment of hepatitis c nonresponders 
we expect to initiate a phase ii trial of this combination in the first half of we are also evaluating development options and business collaborations for a pegylated form of infergen  peg alfacon  for the treatment of chronic hcv infections 
we completed our phase i trial of peg alfacon for the treatment of chronic hcv infections in non core strategic assets we also have strategic assets that do not fit within our core focus areas of pulmonology and hepatology 
these assets are oritavancin  amphotec and actimmune for the treatment of ovarian cancer 
we believe that these non core assets provide us the opportunity to create value through strategic divestiture and partnering arrangements 
significant license acquisition agreements we are highly dependent on technology we license or acquire from third parties 
all of our currently marketed products are subject to license or acquisition agreements with third parties 
the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under the headings license and other agreements  results of operations and note to our financial statements 
we will be required to make contingent milestone payments in accordance with all our license and acquisition agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the milestones defined in each of the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
operating history we have sustained significant losses since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses through at least the end of or beyond 
the extent of our future losses from operations is heavily impacted by revenues from the sale of actimmune and our expectations regarding future actimmune revenues may be negatively impacted by many factors  including continued market and physician acceptance and use of actimmune  reimbursement policies of major insurance companies  the results of our inspire trial for actimmune  and the other factors described under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
our loss from operations was million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in  a decrease of 
these losses resulted from costs incurred in the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates and the acquisition of new technology 
our expenses have consisted primarily of those incurred for research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we have a limited history of operations  which makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
we expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those described under the heading risk factors in this report 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
revenue is recognized at shipment when title passes to a credit worthy customer and reserves are recorded for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
accounting for intangible assets our intangible assets are comprised principally of acquired technology rights 
we apply judgments to determine the useful lives of our intangible assets and whether such assets are impaired 
factors we consider include the life of the underlying patent  the expected period of benefit from the use of the technology  existence of competing technology and potential obsolescence 
we review intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flow we expect the assets to generate 
the assumptions we use in determining cash flows attributable to our intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying business 
in making these estimates  we are required to make judgments as to the future revenue and expenses generated by the asset 
the assumptions and estimates we use when determining the fair value of long lived assets are highly subjective due to the forward looking nature of these estimates 
in some cases we are required to estimate cash flows related to a particular long lived asset for up to years 
please refer to the statements under the heading risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 
we recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow we expect to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds we expect from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
when we identify an impairment  we reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or  when available and appropriate  comparable market values 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
non cancelable purchase obligations for inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and our inventory costs are determined by the first in first out method 
we enter into non cancelable purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 
at december  we had twelve and twenty four month fixed purchase orders of million and minimum purchase obligations through that total million 
we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we are also required to make judgments as to the expiration dates of our products  since our products can no longer be used after their respective expiration dates 
in an effort to help manage our inventory levels of actimmune  we are conducting an ongoing study to determine whether its expiration period may be lengthened 
as part of our excess inventory assessment for all of our products  we also estimate the expiration dates of our products to be manufactured in the future 
recently  projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during for excess inventories and non cancelable purchase obligations 
if revenue levels experienced in future quarters are substantially below our expectations  especially those revenues from sales of actimmune and or infergen  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories and or non cancelable purchase obligations 
please refer to the statements under the heading risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations for year ended december   the change in thousand dollars and percentage when compared to the year ended december  change from increase decrease year ended december  amount in thousands statement of operations data product sales actimmune   other   total product sales  net   costs and expenses cost of goods sold   amortization and impairment of acquired product rights   research and development   selling  general and administrative   acquired research and development and milestone payments  total costs and expenses   loss from operations   interest income   interest and other expense  net loss   revenue 
total product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the growth in product sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to a volume increase in sales of actimmune of million or  and a volume increase in sales of infergen of million or 
our revenues may experience fluctuations due to market and physician acceptance and use of our products  influenced by published reports in medical journals  acceptance in compendia listing  reimbursement policies of major insurance companies  revised treatment guidelines and the rate of patient enrollment in our inspire trial for actimmune 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of goods sold included manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenues 
the increase in cost of goods sold expense in was due primarily to costs associated with increased product sales volumes 
the cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenues  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in  when compared to  was primarily due to reserves included in cost of goods sold for in the amount of million for excess infergen and amphotec inventory and due to the mix of products sold during we expect an increase in actimmune s cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue because we acquire actimmune in accordance with a supply agreement denominated in euros  and we experienced unfavorable currency exchange rates during  which led to higher product costs that we believe will be recognized as cost of goods sold during amortization and impairment of acquired product rights 
we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired product rights of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the charges recorded in and were comprised of the amortization charges related to the acquisition of amphotec and infergen product rights and interferon gamma b patents 
the charges also included a charge of million for the impairment of amphotec product rights recognized during the million impairment charge reduced the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset that we recorded in when we acquired amphotec 
this impairment charge was based on our impairment review of the amphotec product rights  which took into account that sales levels were lower than expected  and that amphotec is not aligned with our new strategic focus in pulmonology and hepatology 
consequently  we have decided to divest amphotec and are currently in the early stages of a competitive process to identify a partner that has the ability to maximize the value of the asset 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease in  when compared to  was primarily due to lower spending on the interferon gamma b and pre clinical development programs of million offset in part by increased spending on the oritavancin and pirfendione development programs of million 
the research and development expenses were lower than expected as a result of delays in the initiation of our phase iii trial of actimmune in ipf and the phase ii trial for peg alfacon in chronic hcv infections and due to reduced spending on research and development projects that are not aligned with our current strategic focus 
we expect that for the fiscal year  research and development expenses will be lower than in due to decreased spending on our research and development projects that are not aligned with our current strategic focus in pulmonology and hepatology 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increased spending in was primarily due to increased legal  insurance  compensation and recruiting expenses totaling million offset in part by lower non cash compensation charges 
the selling  general and administrative expenses for were lower than forecasted as a result of careful monitoring of discretionary spending and decreased spending on programs not aligned with our current strategic focus 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses for will be higher than in primarily due to increased spending on marketing and educational programs 
acquired research and development and milestone payments 
we recorded charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we recorded charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments of million primarily due to a milestone based liability under our agreement with lilly for the completion of the phase iii clinical trial of oritavancin for complicated skin and skin structure infections  and a million charge related to milestone payments primarily due to our license and commercialization agreement with amgen as a result of the commencement of a phase i clinical trial for peg alfacon we expensed both of these charges as acquired research and development and milestone payments as oritavancin and peg alfacon were in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses as of december  in  we entered into license agreement for pirfenidone with marnac and kdl 
at the time of the product acquisition from marnac and kdl  pirfenidone was in phase ii clinical development for certain fibrotic diseases of the lung  heart  kidney and liver 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an exclusive license from marnac and kdl in exchange for an up front cash payment of million and future milestone and royalty payments 
we expensed the million as acquired research and development and milestone payments as pirfenidone was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses at the time of acquisition 
also in  we paid lilly million due to its exercise of its option under our asset purchase and license agreement to reduce the agreed percentage of royalty payable by us to lilly for oritavancin product sales 
we expensed the million in as acquired research and development and milestone payments as oritavancin was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future use as of december  at december   the million was recorded as an accrued liability and was paid in january interest income 
interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to declining investment yields on our cash and short term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates and a lower average portfolio balance for during the period 
interest and other expense 
interest expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense for each of and was primarily due to million in interest expense incurred on million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes which mature in july and million in interest expense related to the amortization of the deferred debt issuance cost 
as of december   we had million of unamortized deferred issuance costs related to these convertible subordinated notes 
we expect to redeem these notes before and or during the third quarter of  which would cause us to recognize the remaining unamortized deferred issuance costs as interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will expire in the years through in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  that expire in the years through  and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and the following table presents our consolidated operations for the year ended december   the change  in thousand dollars and as a percentage when compared to the year ended december  change from increase decrease year ended december  amount in thousands statement of operations data product sales actimmune   other   total product sales  net   costs and expenses cost of goods sold   amortization and impairment of acquired product rights  research and development   selling  general and administrative   acquired research and development and milestone payments  total costs and expenses   loss from operations   interest income   interest and other expense   net loss   revenue 
total product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the growth in product sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to a volume increase in sales of actimmune of million or 
the product sales in included sales from actimmune  amphotec and infergen for the entire period 
product revenues in included all sales of actimmune in the united states  worldwide sales of amphotec for the period from january  the date we acquired the marketing rights to amphotec and sales of infergen in the united states for the period from june  the date we acquired the marketing rights to infergen 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of goods sold included manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our revenues 
the increase in cost of goods sold in was due entirely to costs associated with increased product sales volumes 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenues  were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in  when compared to  was due to lower product costs of actimmune associated with the transfer of manufacturing to bi austria at the end of amortization and impairment of acquired product rights 
we recorded amortization and impairment of acquired product rights of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amount in was comprised of an amortization charge related to the acquisition of amphotec and infergen product rights and interferon gamma b patents 
the amount in was comprised of an amortization charge related to the acquisition of amphotec and infergen product rights and purchased rights to all of the actimmune revenues and related expenses that we had previously contracted to connetics 
the amortization of the actimmune rights was expensed based upon product units shipped under the previous contractual unit baseline for this amounted to million for the period in these actimmune rights were fully amortized by the end of the second quarter of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increased spending in was primarily due to increased costs for phase ii and phase iii clinical trial expenses for actimmune in new disease indications  clinical trial expenses and pre fda approval manufacturing qualification expenses for oritavancin  increased staffing and related expenses necessary to manage the expansion of our operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increased spending in was primarily due to increased staffing and related expenses necessary to manage the growth of our operations  expansion of our field sales force  re launch efforts for infergen and the expansion into our new company headquarters in brisbane  california 
acquired research and development and milestone payments 
we recorded charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we entered into license agreement for pirfenidone with marnac and kdl 
at the time of the product acquisition from marnac and kdl  pirfenidone was in phase ii clinical development for certain fibrotic diseases of the lung  heart  kidney and liver 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an exclusive license from marnac and kdl in exchange for an up front cash payment of million and future milestone and royalty payments 
we expensed the million as acquired research and development and milestone payments as pirfenidone was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses at the time of acquisition 
in  we paid lilly million due to its exercise of its option under our asset purchase and license agreement to reduce the agreed percentage of royalty payable by us to lilly for oritavancin product sales 
we expensed the million in as acquired research and development and milestone payments as oritavancin was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future use as of december  at december   the million was recorded as an accrued liability and was paid in january in  we licensed worldwide rights to oritavancin from lilly 
we paid an up front fee of million to lilly and an additional million in related expenses 
we expensed the million as acquired research and development and milestone payments as oritavancin was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses when acquired 
we will also be obligated to pay lilly significant milestone and royalty payments upon successful development and commercialization of oritavancin 
also in  we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with amgen through which we obtained an exclusive license in the united states and canada to infergen and the rights to an early stage program to develop a pegylated form of infergen peg alfacon for a total consideration of million  plus development milestones and royalties 
under the agreement  we also have the exclusive right to clinically develop infergen and peg alfacon for other indications in the united states and canada 
based upon an independent appraisal  the fair value of the research and development program for peg alfacon was determined to be million 
we expensed this amount as acquired research and development and milestone payments as peg alfacon was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses when acquired 
the remainder of the purchase price of approximately million was for infergen this amount was allocated to developed technology and is being amortized over the estimated product life  which is ten years 
the value we assigned to the acquired research and development for the peg alfacon program was determined by estimating both the costs to develop the purchased in process research and development into a commercially viable product  including development milestones  and the resulting net cash flows from the project  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
we assigned a discount rate of for valuing the in process research and development  which was intended to be commensurate with our corporate maturity  peg alfacon s stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
interest income 
interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in was due to substantially lower market interest rates offset by an increase of average cash available as a result of the completion of a million equity financing during the year 
interest and other expense 
interest expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was due to a full year of interest expense on million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes issued in july  which mature in july  and million in interest expense related to the amortization of the deferred issuance cost 
provision for income taxes 
due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations through issuances of equity and debt securities and sales of our products 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average effective maturity of generally less than months 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease of cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in our net loss  offset by the net change in our operating assets and liabilities 
our net loss of million for the year ended december  included non cash charges of million for the amortization of deferred stock compensation and non cash stock compensation  million for depreciation and amortization of deferred issuance costs  million in amortization and impairment of acquired product rights  and million in acquired research and development and milestone payments related to a milestone based liability related to the completion of the phase iii clinical trial for oritavancin 
the decrease in cash used for operations of million for the year ended december  was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million resulting from increased product sales and an increase in product inventories of million  less the impact of a million increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation expense 
increased sales levels and non cancelable purchase commitments to acquire actimmune led to the increase in product inventory and accounts payable 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to net cash used by investing activities of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the increase in the sale of our available for sale investments  offset by the payments for the purchase of acquired product rights  including research and development and milestone payments 
the increase in the sale of available for sale investments for the year ended december  was primarily due to the cash requirements of funding our operations and the overall decrease of our cash portfolio balance 
for the year ended december   the net cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the net purchases of short term available for sale investments and cash used for the acquisition of product rights 
for the year ended december   the net cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the net purchases of short term available for sale investments 
capital expenditures for equipment and leasehold improvements to support our operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the net cash provided by financing activities included the cash received for the issuance of common shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase program of million  and the exercise of stock options by employees of million 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities included million received in net proceeds  after deducting underwriters fees and expenses  from the sale of million shares of common stock at per share in a follow on public offering  million from stock option exercises and million received under our employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities included million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in a follow on public offering  million received from the sale of convertible subordinated notes due  million from stock option exercises and million received under our employee stock purchase plan 
working capital of million at december  decreased from million at december  the decrease in working capital for the year ended december  was primarily due to funding our operating loss 
in december  we filed a registration statement on form s to offer and sell our common stock in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
currently  million remains available on the form s we have no current commitments to offer or sell any securities that may be offered or sold pursuant to such registration statement 
in february  we issued million of convertible senior notes due march  in a private offering 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain events and at the holders option 
interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears on march and september of each year 
we may not redeem any of these notes prior to maturity 
we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase or redeem before and or during the third quarter of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due however  we may determine not to purchase or redeem all of our convertible subordinated notes due the convertible subordinated notes proceeds were used for general working capital purposes 
in february  we purchased million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due with the proceeds received from our convertible senior notes due march  we paid a total of million related to the purchase  which included million for accrued interest on the convertible subordinate notes  and a premium of million recognized as a loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we have no commercial commitments or loans with related parties  except for ongoing payments in connection with the oritavancin acquisition from lilly to the sgo group llc for which nicholas simon  a former member of our board of directors who resigned in february  was a principal at time of acquisition 
we have no loans with related parties  except for executive loans to dr 
marianne armstrong  our senior vice president regulatory medical affairs and drug safety  and dr 
lawrence blatt  our senior vice president of preclinical and applied research 
both of these loans were in place prior to the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of however  this forward looking statement is based upon the risks identified in this report  our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the commercial performance of any of our products or product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our development and commercialization programs  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope  costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the pace of expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  in preparation for product launches  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  whether we will purchase or redeem our outstanding convertible subordinated debt prior to maturity  and whether we must repay the principal in connection with the issuance of our convertible debt obligations 
as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources
