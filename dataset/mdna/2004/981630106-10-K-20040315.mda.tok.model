item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company maintains an alco responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis 
the alco reports trends and the interest rate risk position to the board of directors each quarter 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
rising interest rates could cause the cost of liabilities to rise faster than the yield on assets 
conversely  the company s interest rate spread and margin could be negatively affected in a declining interest rate environment if prepayments were to increase and the company were to reinvest such proceeds at a lower rate 
the company s spread and margin would also be negatively impacted if deposit interest rates did not decline commensurate with asset yields in such a declining interest rate environment 
similarly  spreads and margins would contract in a so called flat or inverse yield curve environment  in which traditional spreads between short and long term interest rates were to be compressed or become negative 

table of contents in recent years  the company has utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination of a adjustable rate mortgages with terms of up to years and interest rates which adjust every one or three years from the outset of the loan or which adjust annually after a five year or seven year initial fixed period  b shorter term adjustable rate loans  such as home equity loans and lines of credit  and c multi family and commercial real estate loans  selling longer term fixed rate loans  emphasizing core deposit growth by offering deposit products with a variety of interest rates  preparing and monitoring income simulation models  static gap and asset liability funding matrix reports  and selectively utilizing off balance sheet derivatives and hedging instruments  such as interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
on balance sheet derivatives and hedging instruments on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
the company utilizes various derivative instruments for asset liability management and other purposes 
these transactions involve both credit and market risk 
the notional amounts are amounts on which calculations and payments are based 
notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures 
direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid  if any 
interest rate swap agreements the company uses an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portfolio of variable rate  home equity lines of credit 
these loans expose the company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates decrease  interest income decreases 
conversely  if interest rates increase  interest income increases 
during  management believed it prudent to limit the variability of a portion of these interest receipts and entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the terms of the interest rate swap agreement call for the company to receive fixed interest rate payments and remit variable rate interest rate payments 
the interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge 
at december  and  the information dollars in thousands pertaining to the outstanding interest rate swap agreement used to hedge variable rate loans was as follows years ended december  notional amount pay rate based upon the prime rate receive rate maturity in years unrealized gain relating to interest rate swap the company also uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portfolio of brokered certificates of deposit 
these agreements are designated as fair value hedges since they are used to convert the cost of the brokered certificates of deposit from a fixed to a variable rate 
since the hedge relationship is estimated to be effective gain or loss on the swap agreements will completely offset the gain or loss on the certificates of deposit there is no impact on the statement of income or on comprehensive income 
the application of sfas no 
results in an adjustment to the balance sheet to reflect the swap and the certificates of deposit at fair value

income simulation analysis 
the company uses income simulation modeling in order to analyze its interest rate risk under various scenarios 
the income simulation model is designed to measure the performance of the company s net interest income based upon potential changes in interest rates over a select period of time 
the model consists of current data related to cash flow characteristics  repricing opportunities  maturities and current rates for all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  management makes certain assumptions associated with prepayment speeds  maturities for non certificate deposits  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
the model does not include assumptions about future changes to the structure of the balance sheet or actions the company may take to mitigate projected risks 
the income simulation model is produced for several interest rate environments including a flat rate scenario ie no change in current interest rates over a twelve month period 
a second and third model are produced in which a gradual increase of basis points and a decrease of basis points occurs over a twelve month period 
other models are produced  as appropriate  to simulate the flattening or steepening of the yield curve 
under these scenarios  assets subject to repricing or prepayment are adjusted to account for faster or slower prepayment assumptions 
the resultant changes in net interest income are then measured against the flat rate scenario 
for the years ended december  and  the model projects reductions of and  respectively  in the down basis points scenario during the next twelve months 
in an up basis points environment  the model forecasts net interest income contraction of and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the variability calculated in these models is well within the guidelines established by the company s interest rate risk policy 
the preceding income simulation analysis does not represent a forecast of net interest income and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the income simulation models  the actual results will differ reflecting prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps and floors embedded in adjustable rate loans  early withdrawal of deposits  changes in product preferences  and other internal external variables 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december  and  the company s one year gap position  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was positive and  respectively 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount 
table of contents of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a positive gap position would be in a better position to invest in higher yielding assets which  consequently  may result in the yield on interest earning assets increasing at a rate faster than its cost of its interest bearing liabilities than if it had a negative gap 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a positive gap would tend to have its interest earning assets repricing downward at a faster rate than its interest bearing liabilities as compared to an institution with a negative gap which  consequently  may tend to negatively affect the growth of its net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments for selected time intervals 
for loans on residential properties  adjustable rate loans  and fixed rate loans  actual repricing and maturity dates were used 
the mortgage backed securities portfolio was assumed to prepay at a rate of between and annually 
the stratification of savings deposits including now  savings and money market accounts is based on management s philosophy of repricing core deposits in response to changes in the general interest rate environment 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on the company s estimated gap 
while the company believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment activity

interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between net interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the fair values of securities available for sale  including mortgage backed securities  and trading account securities are based on quoted market prices 
the fair values of performing loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality 
fair values for non performing loans are estimated using underlying collateral values  where applicable 
the fair values of non certificate deposit accounts is equal to the carrying amount 
fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits 
the fair values for fhlb advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based upon the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 

table of contents shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  some assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates changed  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  it would become more difficult for borrowers to repay their adjustable rate loans if interest rates increased
