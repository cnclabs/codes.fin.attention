item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
government regulation regarding the environment as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations  our businesses are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws  as well as other legal requirements relating to the generation  storage  transport and disposal of materials 
these laws include  without limitation  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the comprehensive environmental response and compensation and liability act 
we currently do not anticipate any materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations as a result of our compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our manufacturing operations and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise 
during the year ended december   we capitalized less than million related to environmental and safety control facilities 
we expect to capitalize million during the year ending december  we also incurred and expensed million of charges during the year ended december  we expect to incur and expense million in the year ending december  item properties we maintain major facilities worldwide  including significant manufacturing operations located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china 
many of these facilities contain 
table of contents sales offices or warehouses from which we ship finished goods to customers  distributors and commissioned representative organizations 
our executive office is located in burlington  massachusetts 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products group has facilities located in the united states  canada  germany  france  the netherlands  and the united kingdom 
properties in ronkonkoma  new york  berlin  connecticut  spartanburg  south carolina  and auburn  california are leased 
the petrochemical products group has facilities located in the united states  canada  italy and the people s republic of china 
properties in nerviano  italy  naviglio  italy  edmonton  alberta  canada  a distribution center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  and suzhou  people s republic of china are leased 
certain of our facilities are subject to mortgages and collateral assignments under loan agreements with long term lenders 
in general  we believe that our properties  including machinery  tools and equipment  are in good condition  are well maintained  and are adequate and suitable for their intended uses 
our manufacturing facilities generally operate five days per week on one or two shifts 
we believe our manufacturing capacity could be increased by working additional shifts and weekends 
this utilization is subject to change as a result of increases or decreases in orders 
item legal proceedings we  like other worldwide manufacturing companies  are subject to a variety of potential liabilities connected with our business operations  including potential liabilities and expenses associated with possible product defects or failures and compliance with environmental laws 
we maintain liability insurance coverage which we believe to be consistent with industry practices 
nonetheless  such insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial damage claims  which may arise from product defects and failures or from environmental liability 
like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  we have been named as defendants in a growing number of product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in particular  our subsidiaries  leslie  spence  and hoke collectively have been named as defendants or third party defendants in asbestos related claims brought on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs against anywhere from to defendants 
in some instances  we also have been named individually and or as successor in interest to one or more of these subsidiaries 
these cases have been brought in state courts in alabama  california  connecticut  georgia  maryland  michigan  mississippi  new jersey  new york  rhode island  texas  utah  and washington  with the vast majority of claimants having brought their claims in mississippi 
the cases brought on behalf of the vast majority of claimants seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants in the aggregate 
however  the complaints filed on behalf of claimants who do seek specified compensatory and punitive damages typically seek millions or tens of millions of dollars in damages against the aggregate of defendants 
any components containing asbestos formerly used in leslie  spence and hoke products were entirely internal to the product and  we believe  would not give rise to ambient asbestos dust during normal operation or during normal inspection and repair procedures 
moreover  to date  our insurers have been paying the vast majority of the costs associated with the defense of these actions  particularly with respect to spence and hoke for which insurance has paid all defense costs to date 
as we previously have disclosed  due to certain gaps in historical insurance coverage  leslie controls had been responsible for in excess of of the defense costs associated with asbestos actions 
however  during we discovered evidence of additional policy coverage 
as a result  we recently negotiated a revised cost sharing understanding with leslie s insurers which results in a lowering of leslie s responsibility to of defense costs 
in light of the foregoing  we believe that we have minimal  if any  liability with respect to the vast majority of asbestos cases and that these cases  in the aggregate  
table of contents will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  due to the nature and number of variables associated with asbestos related claims  such as the rate at which new claims may be filed  the availability of insurance policies to continue to recover certain of our costs relating to the defense and payment of these claims  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims including our co defendants  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and increases in the expense of medical treatment  we are unable to reliably estimate the ultimate costs to us of these claims 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a monetary settlement with the united states customs service in order to resolve its previously disclosed investigation of our kf industries subsidiary 
this settlement did not have a material financial impact on our financial statements  and we now consider this matter to be closed 
we are currently a party to or otherwise involved in various administrative or legal proceedings under federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations involving a number of sites  in some cases as a participant in a group of potentially responsible parties  referred to as prps 
two of these sites  the sharkey and combe landfills in new jersey  are listed on the national priorities list 
with respect to the sharkey landfill in new jersey  we have been allocated of the remediation costs  an amount that is not material to us 
with respect to the combe landfill  we have settled both the federal government s claim and the state of new jersey s claim for an amount that is immaterial to us 
moreover  our insurers have covered defense and settlement costs to date with respect to the sharkey and combe landfills 
in addition  we have also been named as a prp with respect to the solvent recovery service of new england site and the old southington landfill site  both in connecticut 
these sites are also on the national priorities list but  with respect to both sites  we have the right to indemnification from the prior owners of the affected subsidiaries 
we also have been identified as a prp with respect to the lightman drum company site in new jersey and  in this matter  we also have the right to indemnification from the former owners of the affected subsidiary 
based on currently available information  we believe that any share of clean up costs at these sites attributable to us will not be material  particularly given our indemnification rights against the respective former owners 
we have reviewed all of our pending judicial and legal proceedings  reasonably anticipated costs and expenses in connection with such proceedings  and availability and limits of our insurance coverage  and we have established reserves that we believe are appropriate in light of those outcomes that we believe are probable and estimable at this time 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders there were no matters submitted during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this report to a vote of security holders through solicitation of proxies or otherwise

during the first quarter of  we declared a dividend of per outstanding common share payable on march  to shareholders of record on february  our board of directors is responsible for determining our dividend policy 
although we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends  the timing and level of such dividends will necessarily depend on our board of directors assessments of earnings  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors  including restrictions  if any  imposed by our lenders

overview circor international  inc is a leading provider of valves and fluid control products for the instrumentation  fluid regulation and petrochemical markets 
we offer one of the industry s broadest and most diverse range of products a range that allows us to supply end users with a wide array of valves and component products for fluid systems 
we have organized the company into two segments instrumentation thermal fluid controls products and petrochemical products 
the instrumentation thermal fluid controls products segment serves our broadest variety of end markets  including military and commercial aerospace  chemical processing  marine  power generation  hvac systems  food and beverage processing  and other general industrial markets 
the petrochemical products segment primarily serves the oil and gas exploration  production and distribution markets 
apart from monitoring our key competitors  our businesses pay close attention to changes in market conditions  customer order rates  operating margins  and levels of working capital in order to help manage and improve financial results 
our growth strategy includes both internal product development and strategic acquisitions that complement and extend our current offering of engineered flow control products 
during the last three and one half years  we have made seven acquisitions that extended the product offerings of our instrumentation thermal fluid controls products segment 
in  our acquisitions of dqs international bv and texas sampling  inc provided us with a larger presence in the analytical sampling market 
regarding financial results  we were able to make progress in a number of areas even though end user demand in most of our markets remained weak 
our business teams responded well to the 
table of contents prolonged economic slowdown by sticking to the basics cutting costs  increasing efficiencies and consolidating operations 
consolidated net revenues increased to million  while net income grew by to million 
our higher earnings resulted from the contributions of acquisitions purchased in late  the much improved profitability of our petrochemical products segment  foreign exchange gains  and income tax benefits 
cash flow was strong  as we generated a record million of cash provided by operating activities 
we continued to cut inventories  allowing us to reduce debt  complete two acquisitions  and finish the year in a position in which we have more cash than debt 
basis of presentation all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to currently reported presentations 
we monitor our business in two segments instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products and petrochemical products 
in march  we transferred ssi equipment inc ssi from the petrochemical products segment to the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment 
we believe that this change more accurately reflects the products and markets that ssi serves 
prior periods have been restated to reflect this transfer and net revenues  operating income and identifiable assets are not materially different with this reclassification 
critical accounting policies the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement the section summary of significant accounting policies presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to certain of these policies are initially based on our best estimates at the time of original entry in our accounting records 
adjustments are recorded when our actual experience  or new information concerning our expected experience  differs from underlying initial estimates 
these adjustments could be material if our actual or expected experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
we make frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood of material adjustments 
revenue recognition and allowance for sales returns revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer provided that no significant post delivery obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
allowances for sales returns are recorded as a reduction of revenues based upon historical experience  return policies and contractual product return rights granted to customers 
adjustments to the allowance account are made as new information becomes available 
shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are recorded as components of revenues and the associated costs are recorded as cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts our trade accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  the allowance is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  credit quality  and age of the accounts receivable balances  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 

table of contents our provision for doubtful accounts was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional provisions could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our selling  general and administrative expenses 
allowance for inventory our net inventory balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  our inventory allowance as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  we provide inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
the allowance is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market  based upon assumptions about future demand  and charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of our cost of revenues 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
our provision for inventory obsolescence was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
purchase accounting in connection with our acquisitions  we assess and formulate a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity 
this process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition 
we accrue estimates for certain costs  related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings  anticipated at the date of acquisition  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
business combination and emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
adjustments to these estimates are made up to months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized 
to the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose  the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price  typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances 
costs incurred in excess of the recorded accruals are expensed as incurred 
impairment analysis our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques for industrial manufacturing companies 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit  if triggering events indicate impairment may have occurred 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  we use our best estimates of future cash flows of the reporting unit  the discount rate  and the estimated terminal value for each reporting unit 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future due to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges 
based on impairment tests performed using independent third party valuations  there was no impairment in our goodwill in and 
table of contents other long lived assets include property  plant  and equipment and intangibles with definite lives 
we perform impairment analyses of our other long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
when the undiscounted future cash flows are expected to be less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed for impairment  the assets are written down to fair market value 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of acquisition related costs  research and product development tax credits  state taxes  and the tax impact of non us operations 
our effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
we believe past estimates of our effective rate were reasonable and accurate  being lowered after when goodwill amortization ended 
the effective tax rate was again lowered to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this rate reduction was the result of income tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter totaling million  which included tax credits for product development and research activities  the majority of which related to prior years  and a reduction of income tax liability for certain items 
the benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of coincided with the completion of the internal revenue service s examination of our us federal income tax returns for the two and one half months ended december   and the years december  and for  we expect an effective income tax rate of  including the estimated benefit of the product development and research tax credit for nonetheless  our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain state net operating losses and state tax credits carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various legal claims and legal proceedings some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending 
table of contents claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
for more information related to our outstanding legal proceedings  see contingencies in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we maintain pension benefit plans for our employees in the united states 
these plans include significant pension benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
for  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was  compared with for the discount rate used to estimate the net pension expenses for was compared to in the lower rates reflected the decline in global capital markets and interest rates 
plan assets are comprised of equity investments of companies in the united states with large and small market capitalizations  fixed income securities issued by the united states government  or its agencies  and certain international equities 
there are no common shares of circor international  inc in the plan assets 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over approximately a twelve year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of million 
the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets at december  exceeded the estimated accumulated benefit obligations as a net result of the increases in global capital markets  cash contributions from the company  partially offset by the lower interest rates 
during  we made million in cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
in  we expect voluntary cash contributions to be from million to million  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations will impact future funding requirements 
for  our expected rate of return on plan assets remains unchanged from for pension expenses 
however  for  we lowered our discount rate basis points to on a weighted average basis for pension expenses given the global interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  which could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be materially and adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be reduced 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in  many of the general industrial end markets we serve were in a continuing slump 
however  the stronger foreign currencies such as the euro had a positive effect on our financial results as well as the full year impact of acquisitions  plus the continued success in fulfilling orders on large international oil gas projects  particularly in the middle east 
the majority of our businesses that serve the general industrial markets concentrated in on trimming spending proportional to their declining customer order rates  reducing 
table of contents inventories  identifying opportunities to consolidate facilities  and developing new products and improving customer service levels to maintain and increase market share 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues and net income increased although operating margin declined in from the following tables set forth the results of operations  percentage of net revenues and the yearly percentage change in certain financial data for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges operating income other expense interest expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenues for the year ended december  was attributable to the following in thousands segment total change acquisitions operations foreign exchange instrumentation thermal fluid controls petrochemical total the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the petrochemical products segment accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was the net result of several factors 
revenues increased an incremental million from four acquisitions  tomco and us para plate in october plus dqs international in november and texas sampling in december revenues also increased million resulting from the strengthened euro  translating the revenues of our european business units into higher us dollar amounts in revenues from general industrial instrumentation markets decreased million  primarily due to reduced sales volume caused by weak economic conditions in chemical processing  power generation  commercial aerospace  medical oem  and other general industrial instrumentation markets 
steam and hvac markets were also weak and contributed to lower sales by million 
for  we 
table of contents expect a modest increase in orders on slight improvement in general economic conditions for markets we serve such as aerospace and general industrial instrumentation 
we also expect to benefit from incremental revenue from dqs and texas sampling approximating million to million in total 
petrochemical products revenues increased by million  or  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was the net result of several factors 
revenues increased million resulting from the strengthened euro and canadian dollar  translating the revenues of our italian and canadian business units into higher us dollar amounts in revenues also increased approximately million at our italian subsidiary  pibiviesse  as it was very successful winning and fulfilling orders for large international oil and gas projects  a majority of which were for customers in the middle east 
revenues decreased by million at our north american operations  principally due to reduced oil and gas drilling and production activity and the short cycle maintenance  repair and overhaul mro business in north america  and lower sales in from customer projects in the pacific rim and south american regions 
our expectations for are that the large international oil and gas project market that this segment serves will continue to be positive as projects continue to expand the production of oil and gas reserves  both on land and sub sea  expand distribution pipelines  and increase liquid natural gas production facilities 
we expect revenues from the north american market to provide a modest increase over as rig counts have increased in the later months of and some energy market analysts have projected average rig counts to be higher in compared to gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gross margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  gross profit for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased million from and was the net result of several factors 
gross profit increased million from the incremental contribution of the four acquisitions  tomco  us para plate  dqs international  and texas sampling 
gross profit also increased million from the foreign exchange effect of the stronger euro in gross profit also declined million which was the cumulative decrease from our ongoing business units in this segment 
this segment s gross margin decreased basis points to in due to the reduced sales volume at the ongoing business units  a shift in the mix of sales to lower margin products and fewer sales into higher margin commercial aerospace  medical oem  marine  power generation  and hvac markets  and increased unabsorbed manufacturing costs largely due to scaling back production in conjunction with the successful efforts to lower inventory levels 
this segment also nearly completed two facility closings in the fourth quarter of the tomco products operation was moved into our hoke us plant and the nearly complete move of the ssi equipment operation into the spence engineering plant was finalized in february these two facility consolidations incurred extra internal spending for training  re stocking and start up costs which were expensed 
additional factors that decreased gross profit and margin were increased inventory obsolescence provision on specific product lines and severe pricing competition in certain product lines 
we are expecting the gross margin in to improve modestly from expected improvements include the savings from the two plant closings in late  non repeating only expenses  a modest rise in customer orders in aerospace and general industrial instrumentation markets  but partially offset by continued cost escalation in insurance and employee benefit programs and possibly by raw material price increases as certain metal prices have begun to rise in early gross profit for the petrochemical products segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net gross profit increase was the net result of several factors 
gross profit increased million on s higher sales volume for large international oil and gas projects 
gross profit also increased million resulting from the strengthened euro and canadian dollar 
table of contents in gross profit decreased million in north america caused by lower product sales volume for higher margin maintenance and repair orders  competitive price reductions and higher insurance costs  partially offset by certain manufacturing and purchased inventory cost reductions 
gross margin in this segment increased basis points to in the gross margin improvement was due to increased international oil and gas project shipment volume and improved pricing in our overseas markets  and reduced costs of sale resulting from our foreign sourcing program 
these improvements to gross margin were partially offset by increased unabsorbed manufacturing costs resulting from decreased production volume that could not be avoided in our effort to reduce our inventory levels in our north american manufacturing operations 
in  we expect this segment to improve slightly its gross margin 
gross margin in is expected to benefit from continued foreign sourcing for lower cost inventory  the full year benefit of discretionary expense reductions in  and a modest increase in sales volume  partially offset by competitive pricing and expected cost escalation in insurance and employee benefit programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased by million 
this net increase was the result of million in incremental expense from our four acquisitions  tomco  uspp  dqs and texas sampling  a million increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates  and million increase from higher variable compensation costs  legal fees  and adjustments to the local statutory financial statements of two european subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the petrochemical products segment increased million  net of a million increase from stronger foreign exchange rates changes offset by million lower expenses predominately in our north american operations which have been aggressively reducing their cost structures 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased million in from the decrease in was the net result of lower fringe benefit and corporate development expenses partially offset by higher variable compensation and professional fees 
in  we expect an increase in corporate expenses principally due to the costs associated with the implementation of certain corporate governance programs such as the full year cost of an internal audit capability required by the new york stock exchange and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of which involves documenting and testing internal financial controls 
special charges in totaled million compared to million in these charges were associated with the closure  consolidation and reorganization of certain of our north american manufacturing operations 
special charges were expensed in the periods incurred 
the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment had approximately million of special charges in and none in during the fourth quarter of  this segment closed its tomco manufacturing facility in painesville  ohio and consolidated its operation into our existing hoke manufacturing plant in spartanburg  south carolina 
also during the fourth quarter of  this segment nearly completed the consolidation of its ssi equipment operation from burlington  ontario  canada into its spence engineering plant in walden  new york affecting 
the special charges consisted of million of severance costs  for the employees that were affected  and million of exit costs 
the petrochemical products segment recorded special charges of million in and million in its charges were for million of accrued severance for the announced transfer of the manufacturing capability at its telford operations affecting employees  and the resulting consolidation into a us plant  plus the approximately million write down to market value of an unused us warehouse now held for sale 
its special charges consisted of million of 
table of contents manufacturing equipment write offs  million of severance costs for employees and million of exit costs principally related to two north american leased facilities that were closed 
the accrued liability for severance and exit costs to be paid subsequent to december  is million 
we anticipate that an additional million in special charges will be incurred and recorded during the first half of our estimate for this additional charge is exclusive of any gain or loss on the sale of the real estate that may be realized in connection with the closure and consolidation of the us para plate operation in the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment and the relocation of the telford manufacturing operation in the petrochemical products segment 
the change in operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was as follows in thousands segment total change acquisitions operations foreign exchange instrumentation thermal fluid controls petrochemical corporate total operating income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million or from million reported for the year ended december  operating income for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment decreased million  or  from this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales of product into general industrial  aerospace  marine  medical oem  hvac  and power generation markets  a shift in the mix of sales to lower margin products  severe pricing competition in certain product lines  adjustments to the local statutory financial statements for two european subsidiaries  increased inventory obsolescence provisions  a rise in legal  insurance and pension expense  charges to consolidate two facilities  and increased unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
increases to operating income came from incremental contributions from the acquisitions of tomco and us para plate  and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
operating income for the petrochemical products segment increased million  or  for the year ended december   primarily due to increased product shipments and pricing for large  international oil and gas projects in our overseas businesses  favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and reduced costs of revenues resulting from the international sourcing program 
these gains were partially offset by lower north american manufacturing production volume resulting in unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
corporate spending in was lower by million compared to  primarily due to lower fringe benefit and corporate development expenses  which also contributed to the improved operating income 
net interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily related to the lower outstanding balance of our senior unsecured notes in  reduced costs associated with the amendment of our unsecured revolving credit facility and the lower current year interest rates associated with our million of outstanding industrial revenue bonds 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for this decrease is the result of lower average levels of cash on hand during the current year  due to fourth quarter acquisitions of tomco and uspp and the 
table of contents fourth quarter acquisitions of dqs and texas sampling 
additionally  the current year lower interest rate environment has also reduced the returns on invested cash 
the effective tax rate decreased percentage points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this rate reduction was the result of income tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of totaling million  which included tax credits for product development and research activities  the majority of which related to prior years and a reduction of our income tax liability for certain items 
the benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of coincided with the completion of the internal revenue service s examination of our us federal income tax returns for the two and one half months ended december   and the years ended december  and for  we expect an effective income tax rate of  including the estimated benefit of the product development and research tax credit for net income increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this net increase is primarily attributable to the effect of favorable foreign exchange rate gains  incremental income generated by our petrochemical segment  and tomco and us para plate acquired in the fourth quarter of  lower net interest expense  and the income tax benefits  partially offset by reduced gross profit and gross margins due to lower sales in certain markets and unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
for all of  we expect revenues may be slightly higher from due to an anticipated but gradual improvement in general industrial market conditions  plus the full year impact of our fourth quarter acquisitions 
we expect our operating margins in to rise slightly in the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls product group from  while the petrochemical products group is expected to stay steady near 
both product groups could be affected by increased competitive pricing and certain commodity metal prices increasing their cost of sales

steam and hvac markets improved later in the year with increased sales of million over the prior year 
incremental revenue of million provided from the june acquisitions of rtk and sart and the october acquisitions of tomco and us para plate and a million increase in revenues resulting from changes in exchange rates affecting our european business units also partially offset revenue decreases in other markets 
petrochemical products revenues decreased by million  or 
revenues from our north american operations decreased by million  principally due to reduced oil and gas drilling and production activity and the short cycle maintenance  repair and overhaul mro business  and to a lesser extent  economic weakness in chemical processing and general industrial markets 
revenues generated in the people s republic of china decreased by million 
these decreases in revenue were partially offset by a million increase in revenues from our italian subsidiary  resulting from higher volume shipments of product for large international oil and gas projects  and a million increase in revenues resulting from changes in exchange rates which affected our canadian and italian operations 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  gross profit for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment decreased million 
the net decrease consisted of a million gross profit reduction from operations  partially offset by the incremental million of gross profit from the june acquisitions of rtk and sart and the october acquisitions of tomco and us para plate  and a million increase resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates affecting our european business units 
gross profit and gross margin decreased due to soft end market conditions and reduced sales volume  a lower proportion of higher margin commercial aerospace and general industrial market products  a higher proportion of lower margin project order shipments  unabsorbed manufacturing costs that could not be fully avoided as orders declined and increased current year insurance costs 
gross profit for the petrochemical products segment decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net gross profit decrease consisted of a reduction of million in north america caused by lower product sales volume for higher margin maintenance and repair orders  competitive price reductions and higher insurance costs  partially offset by an

selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment increased by approximately million 
the net increase was principally the result of million of additional expenses related to the june acquisitions of rtk and sart and the october acquisitions of tomco and us para plate  a million increase due to foreign exchange rate changes  offset by a million reduction realized through lower spending for variable general and administrative and compensation expenses on lower staffing levels  partially offset by higher insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the petrochemical products segment decreased million due to million of lower variable selling and compensation expenses  partially offset by a million increase due to foreign exchange rate changes 
significant expense reductions realized in our north american operations were partially offset by the higher costs in our italian operation as a result of increased sales activity 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased less than million  as a result of higher corporate development  insurance costs  and legal and professional fees  partially offset by lower variable compensation and fringe benefit costs 
goodwill amortization expense was not recorded for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  consisted of million for the instrumentation and thermal fluid controls products segment and million for the petrochemical products segment 
on january   we adopted statement no 
that requires goodwill no longer be amortized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our adoption of statement no 
special charges of million and million were incurred in the petrochemical products segment for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these charges were associated with the closure  consolidation and reorganization of certain north american manufacturing operations 
special charges incurred during consisted of million of manufacturing equipment write offs  million of severance costs for employees and million of exit costs principally related to leased facilities that were closed 
special charges incurred during consisted of million of severance and million of exit costs 
special charges were expensed in the periods incurred 
the accrued liability for severance and exit costs to be paid subsequent to december  is less than million

table of contents ended december  compared to the year ended december  operating income for this segment was affected by a million decrease primarily from lower sales volume  reduced sales of higher margin products  unabsorbed manufacturing costs in high volume manufacturing operations and higher insurance costs  partially offset by reductions in variable general and administrative and compensation expenses and lower staffing levels 
this operating income decrease was partially offset by the million from the discontinuation of amortizing goodwill  the million contributed by the june acquisitions of rtk and sart and the october acquisitions of tomco and us para plate  and million from changes in foreign exchange rates 
operating income for the petrochemical products segment increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in the operating income for this segment consisted of an increase of million due to the discontinuation of amortizing goodwill  a net increase of million from operating activities  a million increase due to favorable foreign exchange rate changes  partially offset by a million increase in special charges 
the net million increase from operating activities primarily was the result of higher revenues and the resulting gross profits generated from large international oil and gas projects  and lower variable selling expenses  partially offset by a reduction in sales attributable to weaker mro demand in oil and gas markets  domestic price reductions in the second  third  and fourth quarters  and increased insurance costs 
net interest expense decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily related to the million principal payment of our senior notes  the million reduction of debt assumed from prior years acquisitions and from lower average interest rates on variable rate debt 
interest income on invested balances remained unchanged despite higher average cash balances during as a result of lower interest rates in net other income expense decreased million from a net million expense for the year ended december  to a net million income for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to a million increase in favorable foreign exchange income  a million reduction in minority interest expense resulting from reduced profitability of our chinese joint venture  partially offset by million higher losses on the disposal of capital equipment  million in fees incurred for the early extinguishments of debt and a million reduction in non operating municipal grant income 
the effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the tax rate is primarily the result of the elimination of goodwill amortization expense in accordance with statement no 
 which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
additionally  the implementation of various tax strategies at the beginning of provided a modest rate reduction benefit 
net income decreased less than million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the net decrease is the result of reduced gross profit on lower current year revenue  additional insurance expenses  and higher special charges in the current year  offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization expense  improved operating results within the petrochemical products segment  lower non operating expenses  and reduced net interest expenses  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investment in machinery  equipment and the improvement of facilities  funding working capital requirements to support business growth initiatives  acquisitions  dividend payments  pension funding obligations and debt service costs 
we continue to generate substantial cash from 
table of contents operations and remain in a strong financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses  strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash balances increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   we generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
net income plus non cash charges  such as depreciation  amortization  losses on the disposal and write down of property  plant and equipment and the change in deferred taxes  provided a source of million of operating cash flows 
a net decrease in working capital provided million of operating cash  primarily consisting of a decrease in inventories of million and an increase of million in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the million used for investing activities included million used for the acquisitions of dqs international and texas sampling and for the release of funds from escrow for our prior year purchase of tomco  million used to purchase investments  million used for the purchase of capital equipment  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of investments and the disposal of capital equipment 
we used million for financing activities that included an million net reduction of our long term debt  million to pay dividends to shareholders  partially offset by million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and the conversion of restricted stock units to common shares 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increased cash balances by million 
we have million of investments that are designated as available for sale and readily convertible to cash should the need for additional working capital arise 
our capital expenditure budget for the year ending december  is million 
capital expenditures are primarily for machinery and equipment as part of our ongoing commitment to further improve our manufacturing operations and to manufacture new products 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of december  was compared to as of december  cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december  net debt total debt less cash  cash equivalents and investments as a percentage of total net capital net debt plus equity employed was less than zero as of december  compared to as of december  as of december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under our corporate million unsecured revolving credit facility 
on december   we revised this credit line by entering into an amendment to the original credit agreement that extends the term of the credit facility to december the amendment to the credit agreement also provides us with an option to increase the available line of credit to million  subject to leverage restrictions and certain other conditions 
in accordance with the credit agreement  the rate of interest and facility fees we are charged vary based upon changes in our net debt leverage 
table of contents ratio 
we can borrow at either the euro dollar rate plus an applicable margin of to  or at a base rate plus an applicable margin of to 
the base rate for any day is the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the lender s prime rate 
we are also required to pay an unused facility fee that can range from to per annum and a utilization fee of per annum if our borrowings exceed of the credit facility limit 
as of december   we had million available under the revolving credit facility to support our acquisition program  working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
certain of our loan agreements contain covenants that require  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and also limit our ability to enter into secured and unsecured borrowing arrangements  issue dividends to shareholders  acquire and dispose of businesses  invest in capital equipment  participate in certain higher yielding long term investment vehicles  and issue additional shares of our stock 
we completed an amendment to our revolving line of credit agreement  effective december   that permits foreign subsidiaries to invest their excess cash in high quality securities backed by well capitalized institutions in their respective countries rather than requiring such excess cash to be brought back to the us for investment 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to our existing debt obligations at december  and we expect to be in compliance with all covenants related to our existing debt obligations through in october  we purchased tomco and us para plate for million in cash  net of cash acquired  and assumed million in debt and million of investments at fair market value 
we also deposited an additional million into separate escrow accounts for the benefit of the sellers  subject to any such claims by us as are allowed in accordance with the purchase agreements 
in october  million was released from escrow and distributed to the sellers and accounted for as additional purchase cost 
any funds remaining in the escrow accounts at the conclusion of the contingency periods will be distributed to the sellers and accounted for as additional purchase cost 
on november   we acquired dqs international bv dqs  headquartered in rotterdam  the netherlands  for million in cash and the assumption of million of net debt 
we also deposited an additional million into a separate escrow account for the benefit of the sellers  subject to any such claims by us as are allowed in accordance with the purchase agreement 
any funds remaining in the escrow account at the conclusion of the contingency period will be distributed to the sellers and accounted for as an additional purchase price 
the million excess of the original purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets is recorded as goodwill and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
on december   we acquired texas sampling  inc tsi  located in victoria  texas for million in cash 
we also deposited an additional million into a separate escrow account for the benefit of the sellers  subject to any such claims by us as are allowed in accordance with the purchase agreement 
the million excess of the original purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets is recorded as goodwill and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
any funds remaining in the escrow account at the conclusion of the contingency period will be distributed to the sellers and accounted for as an additional purchase price 
the combined annual revenues for dqs and tsi were approximately million 
we financed both of these acquisitions from available cash balances and we accounted for these transactions as purchase business combinations 
on october  and  we paid the first two million annual payments toward reducing the original million principal balance for our unsecured senior notes in accordance with the note agreement governing these securities 
the outstanding balance at december  is million 
we have three annual principal payments remaining of million each  payable on october    and 
table of contents during  we contributed an additional million into our pension plan trust 
this cash contribution was made to increase the plan assets to a level that was equivalent to  or greater than  the accumulated benefit obligations of the plan as of september  the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  that affect our liquidity in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years thereafter contractual cash obligations notes payable current portion of long term debt total short term borrowings long term debt  less current portion operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments us standby letters of credit international standby letters of credit commercial contract commitments total commercial commitments we have generated net income and positive cash flow from operating activities since the company was spun off from our former parent in october looking forward to the next months  we believe that we will continue to have the necessary funds to operate the company 
if our current sales and profitability trends continue  we expect to be profitable and expect that depreciation expense will be greater than our capital expenditures and that working capital will continue to decrease  particularly inventory which has been a focus during the past two years 
regarding inventory  our inventory turns increased in to based on annualizing our fourth quarter results 
we are striving to achieve a minimum of turns  which could provide an approximate additional million of cash during the next two to three years 
therefore  we expect to generate cash from operating activities that should be sufficient to service operations  capital needs  scheduled debt payments  and our current dividend practice paying per share annually 
in addition  we have available cash balances and investments that are readily convertible to cash and available for use 
apart from our normal operating needs  scheduled debt and expected dividend payments  we continue to search for strategic acquisitions in the flow control market 
we expect that the financing of smaller sized acquisitions would come from existing cash and investments  and if need be  borrowings from our unused million revolving line of credit 
a larger acquisition would require additional borrowings and  or  the issuance of our common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that is material to investors

certain risk factors that may affect future results set forth below are certain risk factors that we believe are material to our stockholders 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and reputation could be harmed 
you should also consider these risk factors when you read forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
you can identify forward looking statements by terms such as may  hope  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  intend  believe  estimate  predict  potential  or continue  the negative of those terms or other comparable terminology 
those forward looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of the following risks occur some of our end markets are cyclical  which may cause us to experience fluctuations in revenues or operating results 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
we sell our products principally to oil  gas  petrochemical  process  power  aerospace  military  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  or hvac  maritime  pharmaceutical  medical and instrumentation markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one  a significant downturn in any one of these markets could cause a material reduction in our revenues that could be difficult to offset 
in particular  our petrochemical business is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for oil and gas is depressed  the demand for our products used in maintenance and repair of existing oil and gas applications  as well as exploration or new oil and gas project applications  is reduced 
as a result  we historically have generated lower revenues and profits in periods of declining demand for petrochemical products 
therefore  results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
future downturns in demand for petrochemical products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face the continuing impact on economic and financial conditions in the united states and around the world as well as current tensions in iraq and the rest of the middle east 
terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic  market and political conditions 
in particular  terrorist attacks  compounded with the slowing national economy  have resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in years and although economic conditions appear to be 
table of contents improving  additional terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world could cause damage or disruption to our business  our facilities  our joint venture partners or our employees which could significantly impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility  including the current tensions in iraq and the middle east  have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  with manufacturing facilities located worldwide  including facilities located in the united states  canada  western europe and the people s republic of china  we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the united states but in other parts of the world as well 
we are predominately uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly  or fail  resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face significant competition in our markets and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
we face significant competition from a variety of competitors in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
new competitors also could enter our markets 
we consider product quality  performance  price  distribution capabilities and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors in our markets 
our competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing  duplicate our strategies  or develop enhancements to products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures  including those described above  and other factors could adversely affect our competitive position  involving a loss of market share or decreases in prices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products that are priced in other currencies 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industries are characterized by intense competition  changes in end user requirements  technically complex products  and evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of qualified engineers  that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 

table of contents implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or could reduce our profitability 
one of our continued strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary instrumentation and thermal fluid controls and petrochemical products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates that may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies we acquire in the future will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of these special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers since many of our product applications involve caustic or volatile chemicals and  in many cases  involve processes that require precise control of fluids 
our products also are used in the aerospace  military  commercial aircraft  pharmaceutical  medical  analytical equipment  oil and gas exploration  transmission and refining  chemical processing  and maritime industries 
these industries require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation  resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to continue operating successfully overseas or to successfully expand into new international markets  our revenues may decrease 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the united states 
in addition  one of our key growth strategies is to market our products in international markets not currently served by us in portions of europe  latin america and asia 
we may not succeed in marketing  selling and distributing our products in these new markets 
moreover  conducting business outside the united states is subject to additional risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in regional  political or economic conditions  trade protection measures such as tariffs or import or export restrictions  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of these factors could prevent us from successfully expanding into new international markets and could also have a material adverse effect on our current international operations 
prices of our raw materials may increase which may adversely affect our business 
we obtain our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third party suppliers 
we do not have contracts with many of these suppliers that require them to sell us the materials we need to manufacture our products 
historically  stainless steel  iron and carbon steel  in particular  have each increased in price as a result of increases in demand 
while in the past we have not experienced difficulties in obtaining the raw materials we require including stainless steel  cast iron and carbon steel  we cannot be certain that our suppliers will continue to provide us with the raw materials we need in the quantities requested or at a price we are willing to pay 
in the past we have been able to partially offset increases in the cost of raw materials by increased sales prices  active materials management  product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in our production processes 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future 
since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials  we may also be subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials for reasons we cannot control 
these include job actions or strikes by 
table of contents employees of suppliers  transportation interruptions and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products at favorable prices  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a change in international governmental policies or restrictions could result in decreased availability and increased costs for certain components and finished products that we outsource  which could adversely affect our profitability 
like most manufacturers of fluid control products  we attempt  where appropriate  to reduce costs by seeking lower cost sources of certain components and finished products 
many such sources are located in developing countries such as the people s republic of china  india and taiwan where a change in governmental approach toward us trade could restrict the availability to us of such sources 
in addition  periods of war or other international tension could interfere with international freight operations and hinder our ability to take delivery of such components and products 
a decrease in the availability of these items could hinder our ability to meet timely our customers orders 
we attempt  when possible  to mitigate this risk by maintaining alternate sources for these components and products and by maintaining the capability to produce such items in our own manufacturing facilities 
however  even when we are able to mitigate this risk  the cost of obtaining such items from alternate sources or producing them ourselves is often considerably greater  and a shift toward such higher cost production could therefore adversely affect our profitability 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  products or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these or existing regulations could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
the costs of complying with existing or future governmental regulations applicable to our importing and exporting practices  and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our expenses  reduce our revenues or reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of laws regarding our international trade practices including regulations issued by the united states bureau of customs and border protection  the bureau of export administration  the department of state  and the department of treasury 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries into which certain of our products may be sold or could restrict our access to and increase the cost of obtaining products from foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of import export laws could result in enforcement actions and or financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 

table of contents we face risks from product liability lawsuits that may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids and chemicals  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
we generally seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our third party suppliers  and for us to be added as an additional insured party under such parties insurance policies 
any such indemnification or insurance is limited by its terms and  as a practical matter  is limited to the credit worthiness of the indemnifying or insuring party 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  product liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the costs associated with the defense of asbestos related claims and the payment of any judgments or settlements with respect to such claims are subject to a number of uncertainties 
as such  we cannot guarantee that such claims ultimately will not have an adverse effect on our financial statements  results of operations or cash flows 
like many other manufacturers of fluid control products  we have been named as defendants in a growing number of product liability actions brought on behalf of individuals who seek compensation for their alleged exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
in general  any components containing asbestos formerly used in our products were entirely internal to the product and  we believe  would not give rise to ambient asbestos dust during normal operation or during normal inspection and maintenance 
as such  we believe that we have minimal  if any  liability with respect to the vast majority of these cases and that these cases  in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  due to the nature and number of variables associated with asbestos related claims  such as the rate at which new claims may be filed  the availability of insurance policies to continue to recover certain of our costs relating to the defense and payment of these claims  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies currently or historically defending asbestos claims  the uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  the type and severity of the disease alleged to be suffered by each claimant  and increases in the expense of medical treatment  we are unable to reliably estimate the ultimate costs of these claims 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  if any of our key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company  some of our customers might choose to use the services of that competitor or those of a new company instead of our own 
other companies seeking to develop capabilities and products similar to ours may hire away some of our key personnel 
nonetheless  if we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees  the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited 
various restrictions and agreements could hinder a takeover of us which is not supported by our board of directors or which is leveraged 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  the delaware general corporation law and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control in a transaction that is not approved by our board of directors or that is on a leveraged basis or otherwise 
these 
table of contents include provisions creating a staggered board  limiting the shareholders powers to remove directors  and prohibiting shareholders from calling a special meeting or taking action by written consent in lieu of a shareholders meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the shareholders  to set the terms of and to issue preferred stock 
issuing preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the owners of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
additionally  we have adopted a shareholder rights plan providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of our shares of common stock  unless the rights are redeemed 
delaying or preventing a takeover could result in our shareholders ultimately receiving less for their shares by deterring potential bidders for our stock or assets 
our debt agreements limit our ability to issue equity  make acquisitions  incur debt  pay dividends  make investments  sell assets  merge or raise capital 
our senior note purchase agreement  dated october   and our revolving credit facility agreement  dated october   and most recently amended on march  effective december   govern our indebtedness to our lenders 
the debt agreements include provisions which place limitations on certain activities including our ability to issue shares of our common stock  incur additional indebtedness  create any liens or encumbrances on our assets or make any guarantees  make certain investments  pay cash dividends above certain limits  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or a similar transaction 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile and investors in our common stock may experience substantial losses 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
our common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenue and expenses  substantial sales of our common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions  or other economic or external factors 
in addition  the stock market as a whole has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources 
our international activities expose us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our international manufacturing and sales activities expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such fluctuations could result in our i paying higher prices for certain imported goods and services  ii realizing lower prices for any sales denominated in currencies other than us dollars  iii realizing lower net income  on a us dollar basis  from our international operations due to the effects of translation from weakened functional currencies  and iv realizing higher costs to settle transactions denominated in other currencies 
any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in western europe  canada and asia 
we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with maturities of less than eighteen months 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate fluctuations because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the oil and gas markets historically have been subject to cyclicality depending upon supply and demand for crude oil  its derivatives and natural gas 
when oil or gas prices decrease expenditures on maintenance and repair decline rapidly and outlays for exploration and in field drilling projects decrease and  accordingly  demand for valve products is reduced 
however  when oil and gas prices rise  maintenance and repair activity and spending for facilities projects normally increase and we benefit from increased demand for valve products 
however  oil or gas price increases may be considered temporary in nature or not driven by customer demand and  therefore  may result in longer lead times for increases in petrochemical sales orders 
as a result  the timing and magnitude of changes in market demand for oil and gas valve products are difficult to predict 
similarly  although not to the same extent as the oil and gas markets  the general industrial  chemical processing  aerospace  military and maritime markets have historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in demand that also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity risk as of december   our primary interest rate risk is related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our industrial revenue bonds 
the interest rates for our revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds fluctuate with changes in short term borrowing rates 
there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility outstanding as of december  based upon expected levels of borrowings under our credit facility in and our current balances for industrial revenue bonds  an increase in variable interest rates of basis points would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we use forward contracts to manage the currency risk related to business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
related gains and losses are recognized when the contracts expire  which are generally in the same period as the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions 
to the extent these transactions are completed  the contracts do not subject us to significant risk from exchange rate movements because they offset gains and losses on the related foreign currency denominated transactions 
as of december   we had no forward contracts to buy foreign currencies 
there were no unrealized gains attributable to foreign currency forward contracts at december  and there were million of gains at december  the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
our risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties is not significant 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
risk management strategies are reviewed and approved by senior management before implementation 
commodity price risk the primary raw materials used in our production process are stainless steel  carbon steel  aluminum  bronze  and brass 
we purchase these materials from numerous suppliers nationally and internationally  and have not historically experienced significant difficulties in obtaining these commodities in quantities sufficient for our operations 
however  these commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may adversely affect our results of operations 
we manage this risk by offsetting increases in commodities with increased sales prices  active materials management  product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in our production processes
