overview we are an asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of mid sized investment management firms our affiliates 
as of december   our affiliated investment management firms managed approximately billion in assets across a broad range of investment styles and in three principal distribution channels mutual fund  institutional and high net worth 
we pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of our existing businesses across these three channels  in addition to investments in mid sized investment management firms and strategic transactions and relationships designed to enhance our affiliates businesses and growth prospects 
through our affiliates  we provide more than investment products across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in our three principal distribution channels 
we believe that our diversification across asset classes  investment styles and distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments 
the following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels 
our affiliates provide advisory or sub advisory services to more than domestic and offshore mutual funds 
these funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries  including independent investment advisors  retirement plan sponsors  broker dealers  major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments 
through our affiliates  we offer more than investment products across more than different investment styles in the institutional distribution channel  including small  small mid  mid and large capitalization value and growth equity 
in addition  our affiliates offer fixed income and specialty products 
through this distribution channel  our affiliates manage assets for foundations and endowments  defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities  and taft hartley plans  with disciplined and focused investment styles that address the specialized needs of institutional clients 
the high net worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of two principal client groups 
the first group consists principally of direct relationships with ultra high net worth and affluent individuals and families and charitable foundations 
for these clients  our affiliates provide investment management or customized investment counseling and fiduciary services 
the second group consists of individual managed account client relationships established through intermediaries  generally brokerage firms or other sponsors 
our affiliates provide investment management services through more than managed account programs 
while we operate our business through our affiliates in our three principal distribution channels  we strive to maintain each affiliate s distinct entrepreneurial culture and independence through our investment structure 
our principal investment structure involves the ownership of a majority interest in our affiliates  with each affiliate organized as a separate firm 
each affiliate operating agreement is tailored to meet that affiliate s particular characteristics and to enable us to cause or prevent certain actions to protect our interests 
we have revenue sharing arrangements with most of our affiliates 
under these arrangements  a percentage of revenue or in certain cases different percentages relating to the various sources or amounts of revenue of a particular affiliate is allocated for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses of the affiliate  including salaries and bonuses 
we call this the operating allocation 
the remaining portion of the affiliate s revenue is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including us  and called the owners allocation 
each affiliate distributes its owners allocation to its managers and to us generally in proportion to their and our respective ownership interests in that affiliate 
we only agree to a particular revenue sharing arrangement if we believe that the operating allocation will cover operating expenses of the affiliate  including a potential increase in expenses or decrease in revenue without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses 
to the extent that we are unable to anticipate changes in the revenue and expense base of an affiliate  the agreed upon operating allocation may not be large enough to pay for all of the affiliate s operating expenses 
the allocations and distributions of cash to us under the owners allocation generally have priority over the allocations and distributions to the affiliate s managers  which help to protect us if there are any expenses in excess of the operating allocation of the affiliate 
thus  if an affiliate s expenses exceed its operating allocation  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers until that portion is eliminated  and then reduce the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of the portion of future owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers 
nevertheless  we may agree to adjustments to revenue sharing arrangements to accommodate our business needs or those of our affiliates  including deferring or foregoing the receipt of some portion or all of our share of an affiliate s revenue to permit the affiliate to fund operating expenses or restructuring our relationship with an affiliate  if we believe that doing so will maximize the long term benefits to us 
in addition  a revenue sharing arrangement may be modified to a profit based arrangement as described below to better accommodate our business needs or those of our affiliates 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for affiliate managers by allowing them to participate in the growth of their firm s revenue  which may increase their compensation from the operating allocation and their distributions from the owners allocation  and to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation  which is available for growth initiatives and compensation 
an affiliate s managers therefore have incentives to increase revenue thereby increasing the operating allocation and their share of the owners allocation and to control expenses thereby increasing the amount of operating allocation available for their compensation 
for the year ended december   approximately million was reported as compensation to our affiliate managers from their respective operating allocations 
additionally  during this period we allocated approximately million of affiliates profits to their managers referred to on our income statement as minority interest 
some of our affiliates are not subject to a revenue sharing arrangement  but instead operate on a profit based model similar to a wholly owned subsidiary 
in our profit based affiliates  we participate in a budgeting process with the affiliate and receive as cash flow a share of its profits 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms 
in those cases  we generally provide incentives to management through compensation arrangements based on the performance of the affiliate 
approximately of our earnings is generated by our profit based affiliates 
net income on our income statement reflects the consolidation of substantially all of the revenue of our affiliates  reduced by the operating expenses of our affiliates  our operating expenses ie  our holding company expenses  including interest  amortization  income taxes and compensation for our employees  and the profits allocated to our affiliates managers  or minority interest 
as discussed above  for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  the operating expenses of the affiliate as well as its managers minority interest generally increase or decrease as the affiliate s revenue increases or decreases because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the affiliate s revenue and its operating allocation and owners allocation 
at our profit based affiliates  expenses may or may not correspond to increases or decreases in the affiliates revenues 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors  including those affecting the financial markets generally and the equity markets particularly  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  the level of affiliate revenue  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results  our receipt of owners allocation from affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which depends on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  the increases or decreases in the revenue and expenses of affiliates that operate on a profit based model  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  the level of expenses incurred for holding company operations  including compensation for our employees  and the level of taxation to which we are subject 
through our affiliated investment management firms  we derive most of our revenue from the provision of investment management services 
investment management fees asset based fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management 
certain clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears 
for example  most client accounts in the high net worth distribution channel are billed in advance and most client accounts in the institutional distribution channel are billed in arrears 
clients in the mutual fund distribution channel are billed based upon average daily assets under management 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  in the high net worth and institutional distribution channels  certain clients are billed on the basis of investment performance performance fees 
performance fees are inherently dependent on investment results and therefore may vary substantially from year to year 
principally  our assets under management are directly managed by our affiliates 
one of our affiliates also manages assets in the institutional distribution channel using an overlay strategy 
overlay assets assets that are managed subject to strategies which employ futures  options or other derivative securities generate asset based fees that are typically substantially lower than the asset based fees generated by our affiliates other investment strategies 
therefore  changes in directly managed assets generally have a greater impact on our revenue from asset based fees than changes in total assets under management a figure which includes overlay assets 
in addition to the revenue derived from providing investment management services  we derive a small portion of our revenue from transaction based brokerage fees and distribution fees at certain affiliates 
in the case of the transaction based brokerage business at third avenue management llc third avenue  our percentage participation in third avenue s brokerage fee revenue is substantially less than our percentage participation in the investment management fee revenue realized by third avenue and our other affiliates 
for this reason  increases or decreases in our consolidated revenue that are attributable to third avenue brokerage fees will not affect our earnings in the same manner as investment management services revenue from third avenue and our other affiliates 
results of operations the following tables present our affiliates reported assets under management by operating segment which are also referred to as distribution channels in this annual report on form k and a statement of changes for each period 
assets under management operating segment at december  dollars in billions mutual fund institutional high net worth directly managed assets percent of total overlay assets percent of total assets under management statement of changes year ended december  dollars in billions beginning of period new investments sale of affiliate equity investment net client cash flows directly managed assets net client cash flows overlay assets investment performance end of period we closed new affiliate investments in friess associates  llc friess and welch forbes llc welch forbes in the fourth quarter of and in third avenue in the third quarter of in the second quarter of  we sold our minority equity investment in paradigm asset management  llc the equity markets experienced significant decreases in and increases in that impact certain comparisons of our assets under management and revenue in this report 
for the year ended december   the s p index and dow jones industrial average decreased and  respectively 
in contrast  for the year ended december   the s p index and dow jones industrial average increased and  respectively 
the operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management represents an average of the daily net assets under management 
for the institutional and high net worth distribution channels  average assets under management represents an average of the assets at the beginning and end of each calendar quarter during the applicable period 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue 
in millions  except as noted change change average assets under management in billions mutual fund institutional high net worth total revenue mutual fund institutional high net worth total net income mutual fund institutional high net worth total ebitda mutual fund institutional high net worth total assets under management attributable to investments that closed during the relevant periods are included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the respective investment 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the basis of presentation of the financial results of our three operating segments 
the definition of ebitda and our reasons for using ebitda are presented in note on page our use of ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources below 
revenue our revenue is generally determined by the following factors our assets under management including increases or decreases relating to new investments  net client cash flows or changes in the value of assets that are attributable to fluctuations in the equity markets  the portion of our assets across the three operating segments and our affiliates  which realize different fee rates  the portion of our directly managed and overlay assets  which realize different fee rates  the recognition of any performance fees  and the level of transaction based brokerage fees 
in addition  the billing patterns of our affiliates will have an impact on revenue in cases of rising or falling markets 
as described previously  advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period  while advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
as a consequence  when equity market declines result in decreased assets under management in a particular period  revenue reported on accounts that are billed in advance of that period may appear to have a relatively higher quarterly fee rate  and in the case of equity market appreciation  revenue reported on accounts that are billed in advance of that period may appear to have a relatively lower quarterly fee rate 
our revenue increased in from  following an increase in revenue in from the increase in revenue in was primarily a result of our investment in third avenue  which closed the third quarter of and is included in our operating results for a full year in this increase was partially offset by lower performance fees in as compared to the increase in revenue in was primarily a result of our investments in friess and welch forbes in the fourth quarter of  and to a lesser extent  third avenue in the third quarter of further contributing to the growth in revenue  though to a lesser extent  were higher performance fees in as compared to these increases were partially offset by the decline in assets under management at existing affiliates which was primarily a result of the broad decline in the equity markets during the following discusses the changes in our revenue by operating segments 
mutual fund distribution channel the increase in revenue of in the mutual fund distribution channel in from resulted principally from an increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management was primarily attributable to our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of and to positive net client cash flows 
the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth in average assets under management because of an increase in assets under management in mutual funds that realize lower fees  principally a result of our investment in third avenue 
the increase in revenue of in the mutual fund distribution channel in from resulted principally from an increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management of in was primarily attributable to our investments in friess in the fourth quarter of and third avenue in the third quarter of and to positive net client cash flows  and was partially offset by a decline in assets under management resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth of average assets under management because of an increase in assets under management in mutual funds that realize lower fees  principally a result of our investments in friess and third avenue 
institutional distribution channel the decrease in revenue of in the institutional distribution channel in from was primarily attributable to lower performance fees in as compared to the increase in revenue of in the institutional distribution channel in from resulted from our investments in friess and third avenue and an increase in performance fees 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline in average assets under management  resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
unrelated to the change in assets under management  revenue also increased because of higher fee rates realized on assets under management within this distribution channel  principally as a result of our investment in friess 
this channel also experienced client cash outflows from overlay assets  which have fee rates that are substantially lower than fee rates earned on directly managed assets 
high net worth distribution channel the decrease in revenue of in the high net worth distribution channel in from resulted primarily from a similar decline in average assets under management 
average assets under management were lower in primarily as a result of the decline in the equity markets in through the first quarter of  as well as net client cash outflows 
this decrease in revenue was partially offset by our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of the increase in revenue of in the high net worth distribution channel in from resulted primarily from our investments in welch forbes in the fourth quarter of  third avenue in the third quarter of and  to a lesser extent  friess in the fourth quarter of the increase in revenue from these investments was partially offset by a decline in average assets under management  resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
unrelated to the change in assets under management  revenue also increased because of higher fee rates realized on assets under management within this distribution channel principally as a result of our investments in new affiliates and  to a lesser extent  because of the effects of advance billing in a declining market as previously discussed  which is the primary billing method used in the high net worth distribution channel 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses 
dollars in millions change change compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses a substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our affiliates  and a substantial majority of affiliate expenses is incurred at affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate s operating allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses 
most notably  our compensation expenses are generally impacted by increases or decreases in each affiliate s revenue by corresponding increases or decreases in their respective aggregate operating allocations 
during the year ended december   approximately million  or about of our consolidated compensation expense  was attributable to compensation allocated to our affiliate managers from their respective operating allocations 
as described previously  the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varies from one affiliate to another and can vary within an affiliate depending on the source or amounts of revenue 
as a result  changes in our aggregate revenue may not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree 
in addition  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in revenue and expenses at our profit based affiliates 
compensation and related expenses increased in  following a increase in the increase in resulted principally from an increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of and therefore inclusion of the operating expenses at third avenue in our operating results for the full year of  partially offset by lower compensation at certain affiliates and the holding company 
the increase in resulted principally from an increase in aggregate affiliate expenses resulting from our investments in friess  welch forbes and third avenue as well as from investment spending for distribution initiatives and increased holding company compensation 
aggregate increases in compensation expenses in were partially offset by compensation expense reductions at certain affiliates that were greater than the proportionate decrease in revenue at such affiliates 
selling  general and administrative expenses were flat in as the inclusion of the selling  general and administrative expenses at third avenue for the full year of were offset by a decrease in distribution expenses at several affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was principally attributable to our investments in friess  welch forbes and third avenue  and was partially offset by a decrease in sub advisory and distribution expenses at the managers funds llc managers resulting from a decrease in its assets under management 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets of in resulted from the inclusion of amortization expense for third avenue and the purchase of additional interests in existing affiliates 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets of in resulted from our adoption of financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer amortized 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in amortization as a result of our investments in friess  welch forbes and third avenue 
depreciation and other amortization expenses increased in and in the increases in both years were principally attributable to the incremental depreciation associated with our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of and other fixed asset purchases at the holding company and other affiliates 
other operating expenses were flat in  following a increase in in  the effect of a full year of operating expenses associated with our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of were offset by lower spending at other affiliates 
the increase in was principally attributable to the incremental expenses associated with our investments in friess and welch forbes and increased spending from the operating allocation at affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
other income statement data the following table summarizes other income statement data 
dollars in millions change change minority interest income tax expense interest expense investment and other income minority interest was flat in  following a increase in in  the minority interest expense resulting from our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of was offset by increased investment spending at certain of our affiliates  which decreased the minority interest at such affiliates 
the increase in minority interest in resulted principally from the previously discussed increase in revenue in this increase was proportionately greater than the increase in revenue because of our investment in friess  in which we own of the firm s owners allocation  representing a relatively lower percentage ownership than our other affiliate investments 
the increase in income tax expense in was principally attributable to an increase in income before taxes  as well as an increase in the effective tax rate from to 
our effective tax rate increased as a result of an increase in state taxes attributable to the growth of certain of our affiliates in relatively higher tax rate jurisdictions 
the increase in income taxes in was attributable only to the increase in income before taxes  as our effective tax rate did not change over the prior year 
interest expense decreased by million  or  in  following a increase in the decrease in interest expense in was attributable to expenses that did not recur in million of debt issuance cost amortization and million of settlements on interest rate derivative contracts 
these decreases were partially offset by interest expense attributable to our floating rate senior convertible securities issued in february of the increase in interest expense in resulted principally from million of interest expense related to our issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities in december and january  on which we pay interest at the annual rate of 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense from lower average debt outstanding on our senior revolving credit facility and million of lower amortization related to the transition adjustment under financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
investment and other income increased in  following a decrease in the increase in investment and other income in was primarily attributable to income related to elevated cash holdings following the february issuance of floating rate senior convertible securities and  to a lesser extent  income recognized in from an alliance between our affiliate  rorer asset management  llc rorer  and a leading global provider of asset management and investment technology solutions 
the decrease in investment and other income in was attributable to the maintenance of lower levels of excess cash at the holding company as a result of our investments in friess and welch forbes in the fourth quarter of and third avenue in the third quarter of net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years dollars in millions change change net income the increase in net income in resulted primarily from increases in revenue and investment and other income and lower interest expense  offset partially by the increases in operating and income tax expenses  as described above 
net income for and reflect changes in the accounting for intangible assets as a result of the implementation of fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  in the first quarter of  and therefore is not directly comparable to the operating results presented for note to our consolidated financial statements presents our net income for as though we had adopted fas on january  the increase in net income in resulted from approximately million of amortization of certain intangible assets during that did not recur in as a result of our adoption of fas  as well as the increases in revenue described above 
these factors were partially offset by the increases in interest expense and minority interest expense  also described above 
supplemental performance measure as supplemental information  we provide a non gaap performance measure that we refer to as cash net income 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income 
cash net income is defined as net income plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets plus affiliate depreciation 
we consider cash net income an important measure of our financial performance  as we believe it best represents operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our affiliates 
cash net income is used by our management and board of directors as a principal performance benchmark  including as a measure for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 
since our acquired assets do not generally depreciate or require replacement by amg  and since they generate deferred tax expenses that are unlikely to reverse  we add back these non cash expenses to net income to measure operating performance 
we add back amortization attributable to acquired client relationships because this expense does not correspond to the changes in value of these assets  which do not diminish predictably over time 
the portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets including goodwill that we no longer amortize but which continues to generate tax deductions is added back  because these accruals would be used only in the event of a future sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge  which we consider unlikely 
we add back the portion of consolidated depreciation expense incurred by our affiliates because under our affiliates operating agreements we are generally not required to replenish these depreciating assets 
conversely  we do not add back the deferred taxes relating to our floating rate senior convertible securities or other depreciation expenses 
in connection with our issuance of these convertible securities in february  we modified our definition of cash net income to clarify that deferred taxes relating to these convertible securities and certain depreciation are not added back 
in prior periods  cash net income represented net income plus depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to cash net income for each of the past three years 
dollars in millions net income intangible amortization intangible related deferred taxes affiliate depreciation cash net income as described above  cash net income for and reflects the change to our definition of cash net income that resulted from the implementation of fas in the first quarter of  and therefore is not directly comparable to the operating results presented for in addition  in  we modified the definition of cash net income to clarify that deferred taxes relating to our issuance of convertible securities and certain depreciation are not added back for the calculation of cash net income 
if we had adopted fas and used the modified definition of cash net income beginning in  cash net income for and would have been million and million  respectively 
for  prior to our adoption of fas  we did not add back deferred taxes to measure cash net income 
for  this figure represents our total deferred taxes 
for and  this figure represents our consolidated depreciation 
cash net income increased in  primarily as a result of the previously described factors affecting net income 
cash net income increased in  primarily as a result of the previously described factors affecting net income and related changes in the accounting for intangible assets resulting from our adoption of fas liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of december in the years indicated below dollars in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents senior bank debt zero coupon convertible debt floating rate convertible securities mandatory convertible securities cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows ebitda the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page in  we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities and the issuance of convertible debt securities 
our principal uses of cash were to repurchase debt securities  repay indebtedness  repurchase shares of our common stock and make distributions to affiliate managers 
we expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing affiliates  distributions to affiliate managers  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  the repurchase of debt securities  the repurchase of shares of our common stock and for working capital purposes 
we view our ratio of debt to ebitda our leverage ratio as an important gauge of our ability to service debt  make new investments and access capital 
consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our mandatory convertible securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
as more fully discussed below  each unit of our prides  as well as our recently issued prides  is comprised of a senior note and a forward purchase contract 
the exercise of the forward purchase contract at the respective remarketing dates of each of our prides securities will result in the issuance of shares of our common stock that will generate cash proceeds sufficient to amortize debt in an amount equal to the remaining note portion of each security 
we also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting our cash and cash equivalents from our debt balance 
the leverage covenant of our senior revolving credit facility is generally consistent with our treatment of the prides securities and our net debt approach 
at december   our leverage ratio was senior revolving credit facility we have a million senior revolving credit facility the facility with several major commercial banks 
the facility  which is scheduled to mature in august  currently provides that we may borrow at rates of interest based either on the eurodollar rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time that vary depending on our credit ratings 
subject to the agreement of the lenders or prospective lenders to increase their commitments  we have the option to increase the facility to million 
the facility contains financial covenants with respect to net worth  leverage and interest coverage  and requires us to pay a quarterly commitment fee on any unused portion 
the facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  liens  cash dividends and fundamental corporate changes 
any borrowings under the facility would be collateralized by pledges of all capital stock or other equity interests owned by us 
as of march   we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility 
zero coupon senior convertible notes in may  we completed a private placement of zero coupon senior convertible notes in which we sold a total of million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes due  accreting at a rate of per year 
each  principal amount at maturity zero coupon senior convertible note is convertible into shares of our common stock the settlement rate upon the occurrence of certain events  including the following i if the closing price of a share of our common stock is more than a specified price over certain periods initially and increasing incrementally at the end of each calendar quarter to on april   ii if the credit rating assigned by standard poor s to the securities is below bb  or iii if we call the securities for redemption 
we may redeem the securities for cash on or after may  the holders may require us to repurchase the securities at their accreted value on may of   and we may choose to pay the purchase price for such repurchases in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination thereof 
in  we repurchased million principal amount at maturity of these notes in privately negotiated transactions 
mandatory convertible securities in december  we completed a public offering of mandatory convertible securities prides 
a sale of an over allotment of the securities was completed in january  increasing the amount outstanding to million 
as described below  these securities are structured to provide million in additional proceeds to us following a remarketing and the exercise of forward purchase contracts in november each pride initially consists of i a senior note due november  with a principal amount of per note  on which we pay interest quarterly at the annual rate of  and ii a forward purchase contract pursuant to which the holder has agreed to purchase  for per contract  shares of our common stock on november   with the number of shares to be determined based upon the average trading price of our common stock for a period preceding that date 
depending on the average trading price in that period  the settlement rate will range from to shares per senior note 
based on the trading price of our common stock as of march   the purchase contracts would have a settlement rate of 
each of the senior notes is pledged to us to collateralize the holder s obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
beginning in august  under the terms of the prides  the senior notes will be remarketed to new investors 
a successful remarketing will generate million of proceeds to be used by the original holders of the prides to honor their obligations on the forward purchase contracts 
in exchange for the additional million in payment on the forward purchase contracts  we will issue shares of our common stock 
as referenced above  the number of shares of common stock to be issued will be determined by the price of our common stock at that time 
the senior notes will remain outstanding until november and assuming a successful remarketing will be held by the new investors 
floating rate senior convertible securities in february  we completed a private placement of an aggregate of million of floating rate senior convertible securities 
these securities bear interest at a rate equal to month libor minus  payable in cash quarterly 
each  floating rate senior convertible security is convertible into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events  including the following i if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share over certain periods  ii if the credit rating assigned to us by standard poor s is below bb  or iii if we call the securities for redemption 
upon conversion  the initial settlement rate will be shares of our common stock for each  floating rate senior convertible security 
in addition  if the market price of our common stock exceeds per share at the time of conversion  holders will receive additional shares of our common stock based on the price of our common stock at that time 
based on the trading price of our common stock as of march   each security would have a settlement rate of shares 
we have the option to redeem the securities for cash at any time on or after february  at their principal amount 
the holders of the securities may require us to repurchase these securities on february of    and  at their principal amount 
we may choose to pay the purchase price for such repurchases in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination thereof 
the floating rate senior convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations 
these regulations require us to deduct interest expense at the rate at which we would issue a non contingent  non convertible  fixed rate debt instrument 
when the implied interest rate for tax purposes is greater than the actual interest rate  a deferred tax expense is generated 
while the implied interest rate for these securities for tax purposes is  the actual rate is three month libor minus as of march   this rate equaled 
based on current libor rates  these securities generate approximately million of deferred taxes each year 
while these deferred tax liabilities may never reverse  such liabilities will reverse if we redeem the securities on february  or later and if our common stock is trading at per share or less on the date of redemption 
all deferred taxes related to the securities will be reclassified to equity if the securities convert and our common stock is trading at more than per share when it is delivered to holders 
mandatory convertible securities in february  we completed private offerings of million of mandatory convertible securities prides 
as described below  these securities are structured to provide million of additional proceeds to us following a remarketing and exercise of forward purchase contracts in february each pride initially consists of i a senior note due february  with a principal amount of  per note  on which we pay interest quarterly at the annual rate of  and ii a forward purchase contract pursuant to which the holder has agreed to purchase  for  per contract  shares of our common stock on february  holders of the purchase contracts will receive a quarterly contract adjustment payment at the annual rate of per  contract 
the number of shares to be issued on february   will be determined based upon the average trading price of our common stock for a period preceding that date 
depending on the average trading price at that time  the settlement rate will range from to shares per  senior note 
based on the trading price of our common stock as of march   the purchase contracts would have a settlement rate of 
each of the senior notes is pledged to us to collateralize the holder s obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
beginning in august  under the terms of the prides  the senior notes will be remarketed to new investors 
a successful remarketing will generate million of proceeds to be used by the original holders of the prides to honor their obligations on the forward purchase contracts 
in exchange for the additional million in payment on the forward purchase contracts  we will issue shares of our common stock 
the senior notes will remain outstanding until february or later and assuming a successful remarketing will be held by the new investors 
in connection with our prides private offerings  through march   we repurchased an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the share repurchases are intended to offset our november obligation to issue shares of our common stock under the terms of the forward purchase contracts of our prides 
purchases of affiliate equity our affiliate operating agreements provide our affiliate managers the conditional right to require us to purchase their retained equity interests at certain intervals 
the agreements also provide us the conditional right to require affiliate managers to sell their retained equity interests upon their death  permanent incapacity or termination of employment and provide affiliate managers the conditional right to require us to purchase such retained equity interests upon the occurrence of such events 
these purchases will occur at varying times and in varying amounts over a period of approximately years  however  the actual timing and amounts of such purchases generally cannot be predicted with any certainty 
these purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the affiliate s cash flow distributions  which is intended to represent fair value 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases  in the event that a triggering event and resulting purchase occurred with respect to all such retained equity interests as of december   the aggregate amount of these payments would have totaled approximately million 
in the event that all such transactions were closed  we would own the prospective cash flow distributions of all equity interests that would be purchased from our affiliate managers 
as of december   this amount would represent approximately million on an annualized basis 
we pay for these purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration 
with our approval  affiliate managers are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities 
these potential purchases  combined with our other cash needs  may require more cash than is available from operations  and therefore  we may need to raise capital by making borrowings under our facility  by selling shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities  or to otherwise refinance a portion of these purchases 
operating cash flow cash flow from operations generally represents net income plus non cash charges for amortization  deferred taxes and depreciation  as well as the changes in our consolidated working capital 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in  as compared to  resulted principally from increases in receivables at december  from december  as a result of the growth in revenue reported in the fourth quarter of in comparison to the same period in for the year ended december   a significant portion of bonus compensation payments was made in december  while a significant portion of such payments for the year ended december  was made in the first quarter of supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information in this annual report on form k  we have provided information regarding our ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from operations 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be consistent with computations of ebitda by other companies 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe that ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
we further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operations to ebitda for the last three years dollars in millions cash flow from operations interest expense  net of non cash items current tax provision changes in assets and liabilities and other adjustments ebitda investing cash flow changes in net cash flow from investing activities result primarily from our investments in new and existing affiliates 
net cash flow used to make investments was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we made payments to acquire interests in existing affiliates 
in  we closed our investment in third avenue using working capital and borrowings under the facility and we also made payments to acquire interests in existing affiliates 
in january  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a equity interest in the operating business of genesis holdings international 
the purchase price will be funded from available cash 
financing cash flow the increase in net cash flow from financing activities in  as compared to  was attributable to our issuance of the floating rate senior convertible securities in february the principal sources of cash from financing activities during and were borrowings under our bank facility and the issuances of convertible debt securities  respectively 
in  our uses of cash from financing activities were to repurchase million of principal amount at maturity of the zero coupon senior convertible securities  repurchase shares of our common stock and repay debt 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share under our share repurchase program 
our share repurchase program was authorized by the board of directors in april  permitting us to repurchase up to of our common stock 
in july and april  our board of directors approved increases to the existing share repurchase program  in each case authorizing the purchase of up to an additional of our common stock 
in january  our board of directors approved  in connection with our prides  an additional share repurchase program  permitting us to repurchase up to an additional one million shares of our outstanding common stock over a twelve month period following the closing of our prides private placement 
as authorized by our board of directors  we also repurchased shares at the time of the closing of our prides private placement 
the timing and amount of purchases under the repurchase programs are determined at the discretion of our management 
at march   a total of  shares of common stock remained authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase programs 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions long term debt purchases of affiliate equity leases other liabilities total  long term debt reflects the principal payments on the zero coupon senior convertible notes  mandatory convertible securities and floating rate senior convertible securities 
as more fully discussed on page  consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our mandatory convertible securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
each unit of our prides  as well as our recently issued prides which are not included in the above table  is comprised of a senior note and a forward purchase contract 
the exercise of the forward purchase contract at the respective remarketing dates will result in the issuance of shares of our common stock and will generate cash proceeds to amortize debt in an amount equal to the remaining note portion of each security 
purchases of affiliate equity reflect estimates of our conditional purchases of additional equity in our affiliates and assume that all conditions to such purchases are met and that such purchases will all be effected on the date that they are first exercisable 
as described previously  these purchases could occur in varying amounts over the next years  however  the actual timing and amounts of such purchases generally cannot be predicted with any certainty 
additionally  in many instances we have the discretion to settle these purchases with our common stock and in all cases can consent to the sale of these interests to other individuals or entities 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases  assuming that all such purchases had been effected as of december   the aggregate purchase amount would have totaled approximately million 
assuming the closing of such additional purchases  we would own the prospective cash flow distributions associated with all additional equity so purchased  estimated to be approximately million on an annualized basis as of december  we have an option to purchase of friess in the fourth quarter of in the event a right to sell this interest to us is not exercised at that time  this potential purchase of the friess equity represents the substantial majority of the purchases in the upcoming year 
other liabilities reflect notes payable to affiliate managers that were issued in connection with our purchase of additional affiliate equity interests 
interest rate sensitivity our revenue is derived primarily from fees which are based on the values of assets managed 
such values are affected by changes in the broader financial markets which are  in part  affected by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
with respect to any debt financing  we may be exposed to potential fluctuations in the amount of interest expense resulting from changing interest rates 
we may seek to offset such interest rate exposure in part by entering into hedging contracts 
market risk in the past we have used interest rate derivative contracts to manage market exposures associated with our variable rate debt by creating offsetting market exposure  while we do not currently have any interest rate swap contracts in place  we may enter into such contracts  or engage in similar hedging activities  in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will use such derivative contracts in the future or that the amount of coverage we might obtain will cover all of our indebtedness outstanding at any such time 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any possible derivative contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense 
recent accounting developments in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which provides new accounting guidance on when to consolidate a variable interest entity vie 
fin defines a vie as a legal entity that either has no equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a vie will be consolidated by the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the vie s expected losses or  if no enterprise absorbs the majority of the losses  the vie will be consolidated by the enterprise that receives the majority of the expected residual returns 
fin was immediately effective for us for vies created after january  and will become effective for vies created prior to february  on march  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on us and is not expected to in in july  we adopted financial accounting standard no 
fas accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  as amended by subsequent financial accounting standards board staff positions 
in the event that we receive notice from an affiliate manager of their intention to exercise a conditional right requiring us to purchase their equity  fas requires that we reflect the purchase price as a liability 
the adoption of fas did not have a material impact on us in and is not expected to have a material impact on us in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
valuation in allocating the purchase price of our investments and testing our intangible assets for impairment  we make estimates and assumptions to determine the value of our acquired client relationships and operating segments 
we also assess the value of minority interests held by our affiliate managers in establishing the terms for their transfer 
in these valuations  we make assumptions of the growth rates and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts 
additionally  we make assumptions of  among other factors  valuation multiples  tax benefits and discount rates 
in certain instances  we engage third party consultants to perform independent evaluations 
the impact of many of these assumptions are material to our financial condition and operating performance and  at times  are subjective 
if we used different assumptions  our intangible assets and related amortization could be stated differently and our impairment conclusions could be modified 
additionally  the use of different assumptions to value our minority interests could change the amount of compensation expense  if any  we report upon their transfer 
intangible assets at december   the carrying amounts of our intangible assets are as follows dollars in millions definite lived acquired client relationships indefinite lived acquired client relationships goodwill we amortize our definite lived acquired client relationships over their expected useful lives 
we reassess these lives each quarter based on historical attrition rates and other events and circumstances that may influence prospective attrition rates 
we assess each acquired client relationship separately for impairment by comparing its carrying value to its projected undiscounted cash flows 
significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life could have a significant impact on the amount of our annual amortization expense 
for example  if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of our definite lived acquired client relationships by one year  our amortization expense would increase by million per year 
we do not amortize our indefinite lived acquired client relationships because we expect these contracts will contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
each reporting period  we assess whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the indefinite life criteria are no longer met 
at least annually  or at such time as the indefinite life criteria are no longer met  we will compare the carrying value of each relationship to its fair value  which reflects assumptions of the growth of the assets  discount rates and other factors 
significant judgment is required to assess fair value 
changes in the estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the impairment conclusion 
we test the carrying amount of our goodwill at least once a year 
we test the goodwill balances of each of our operating segments by comparing the carrying amount of the segment to its fair value 
significant judgment is required to assess fair value 
changes in the estimates used in this test could materially affect our impairment conclusion 
deferred taxes our deferred tax liabilities are generated from tax deductible intangible assets and  to a lesser extent  from our floating rate convertible securities 
as more fully described below  we generally believe that our intangible related deferred taxes which totaled approximately million in are unlikely to reverse  and believe that the deferred tax liabilities for our floating rate convertible securities may not reverse 
as such  we currently believe the economic benefit we realize from these sources will be permanent 
our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our affiliate investments as cash transactions that are taxable to the sellers 
we record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes  but do amortize for tax purposes  thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes 
these liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge  events we consider unlikely to occur 
under current accounting rules  we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability 
as of december   our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment charge was approximately million 
our floating rate convertible securities also generate deferred tax liabilities because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our interest expense for financial statement purposes 
as described in greater detail on page  if our stock price exceeds per share when the securities are converted  the cumulative tax savings realized in prior periods the deferred tax liability will be reclassified to equity 
as of march   our stock price was 
beginning in february  we have the right to redeem these securities  which could result in our realization of these benefits 
in addition  we also regularly assess our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of state credits and loss carryforwards  in order to determine the need for valuation allowances 
in our assessment we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset  we would establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination 
as of december   we had approximately million of these assets that had no valuation allowance 
changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings 
for example  a increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately million in our tax expense in the period of such determination 
revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees asset based and performance based 
while most asset based advisory fees are billed by our affiliates quarterly  some are billed before services are rendered in advance and others are billed after services are rendered in arrears 
in each case  revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
any fees billed in advance are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of service 
unlike asset based fees  which are calculated based upon a contractual percentage of a client s assets under management  performance based fees are generally assessed as a percentage of the investment performance realized on a client s account in a quarterly or annual period 
performance based fees are recognized in the quarter in which the fee becomes billable 
economic and market conditions the asset management industry is an important segment of the financial services industry and has been a key driver of growth in financial services over the last decade 
as of the end of  according to the most recent available data  industry wide assets under management across the mutual fund  institutional and high net worth distribution channels totaled more than trillion 
this figure does not reflect the substantial growth in the equity markets during  with growth of in the s p index and in the dow jones industrial average  total industry assets under management have increased substantially since we believe prospects for overall industry growth estimated by one consultant to increase at a rate of annually over the next four years remain strong 
we expect that this growth will be driven by market related increases in assets under management  broad demographic trends and wealth creation related to growth in gross domestic product  and will be experienced in varying degrees across all three of the principal distribution channels for our affiliates products mutual fund  institutional and high net worth 
in the mutual fund distribution channel  according to an industry report  more than million individuals in almost million households in the united states are invested in mutual funds 
in  net inflows to equity mutual funds totaled approximately billion  with aggregate mutual fund assets totaling trillion at the end of we anticipate that inflows to mutual funds will continue and that aggregate mutual fund assets  particularly those in equity mutual funds  will continue to increase in line with long term market growth 
assets in the institutional distribution channel are in retirement plans  as well as endowments and foundations  with total assets in the channel of approximately trillion at the end of the most recently compiled industry data 
net cash flows in to institutional products were approximately billion in  with the majority of these new investments in equity products 
we anticipate that the combination of an aging work force and long term market growth should contribute to the ongoing strength of this distribution channel 
the high net worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of high net worth and affluent individuals  family trusts and managed accounts 
within this channel  ultra high net worth and high net worth families and individuals those having at least million in investable assets had aggregate assets of trillion at the end of the most recent compiled industry data  industry experts expect assets in this segment of the channel to grow to trillion by the end of we believe that affluent individuals those having between  and million in investable assets represent an important source of asset growth within the high net worth channel  as the number of such individuals and the amount of investable assets increases  and the popularity of separately managed account investment products for affluent individuals continues to grow 
according to a recent industry report  assets in separately managed accounts totaled in excess of billion at the end of  a increase over the same report also noted that the market share of separately managed account products among mid sized asset management firms those with between billion and billion in assets under management is growing  and increased to more than of both accounts and assets in international operations first quadrant limited  an affiliate of first quadrant  lp  is organized and headquartered outside of london  england 
tweedy  browne company llc  which is based in new york  maintains a research office in london 
dfd select group  sarl  a subsidiary of dfd select group  sarl in which we own a minority interest  is organized and headquartered in paris  france 
in addition  on january   we entered into a definitive agreement with genesis holdings international genesis to acquire a equity interest in the operating business of genesis 
genesis has offices in london  guernsey  chile and brazil 
in the future  we may invest in other investment management firms which are located and or conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  less stringent legal  regulatory and accounting regimes  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls  expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our affiliated investment management firms that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
