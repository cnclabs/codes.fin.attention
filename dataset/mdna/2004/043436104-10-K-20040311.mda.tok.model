item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a national automotive retailer  operating franchises at dealership locations in states and markets in the us  offering different brands of vehicles 
we also operate collision repair centers that serve our markets 
our revenues are derived from three basic products the sale of new and used cars and light trucks  maintenance and collision repair services and the sale of automotive parts collectively  fixed operations  and the arrangement of vehicle financing and the sale of various insurance and warranty products collectively  f i 
additionally  we operate a heavy truck business offering four brands in atlanta  georgia 
we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes  our fixed operations based on gross profit dollars  and f i based gross profit per vehicle retailed pvr 
since inception  we have grown through the acquisition of platforms and numerous tuck in acquisitions 
all acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the operations of the acquired dealerships are included in the consolidated statements of income commencing on the date acquired 
as a result  we evaluate our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis in order to determine organic growth 
our gross profit varies with our revenue mix 
the sale of vehicles generally results in lower gross profit margins  while parts  service  collision repair  and finance and insurance revenues produce higher gross profit margins 
as a result  when vehicle sales decrease as a percentage of total sales  we expect that our overall gross profit percentage would increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist primarily of fixed and incentive based compensation  advertising  rent  insurance  utilities and other typical operating expenses 
a significant portion of our selling expenses are variable such as sales commissions  or controllable expenses such as advertising  generally allowing our cost structure to adapt in response to trends in our business 
we evaluate these and our other general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profit 
sales of motor vehicles particularly new vehicles have historically fluctuated with general macroeconomic conditions including general business cycles  consumer confidence  availability of consumer credit  fuel prices and interest rates 
although these factors may impact our business  we believe that any future negative trends may be mitigated by the performance of our used vehicles sales  parts  service and collision repair operations  our variable cost structure  regional diversity and advantageous brand mix 
our operations are subject to modest seasonal variations that are somewhat offset by our regional diversity 
we typically generate more revenue and operating income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
seasonality is based upon  among other things  weather conditions  manufacturer incentive programs  model changeovers and consumer buying patterns 
over the past several years certain automobile manufacturers have used a combination of vehicle pricing and financing incentive programs  which have impacted customer demand for new vehicles 
these programs serve to increase competition for late model used vehicles 
we foresee the manufacturers continuing to use these incentive programs in the future and  as a result  we will continue to monitor our used inventory mix in order to carry higher levels of used vehicle inventory at lower price points in order to reduce competition with our new vehicle sales 
in addition  we expect to continue to expand our service capacity in order to meet anticipated future demand  as the relatively high volume of new vehicles sales resulting from the highly incentivized new vehicle market will drive service demand in the future 
we expect the industry wide gain in market share of the luxury and mid line import brands to continue in the near future 
we feel that our brand mix  which is heavily weighted toward these brands  is well positioned to take advantage of this continued shift in customer buying habits 
interest rates over the past several years have been at historical lows 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates significantly impact customer buying patterns  as changes in interest rates do not dramatically increase the monthly payment of a financed vehicle 
for example  the monthly payment for a typical vehicle financing transaction in which a customer finances  at over months only increases by with a basis point increase in interest rates 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  net income for the year ended december   was million or per basic share  including a million loss from discontinued operations principally related to our price pilot program  and other significant charges including a charge related to the impairment of goodwill at our oregon platform and other non operational expenses as discussed in more detail below 
net income for the year ended december   was million or per share 
for the year ended december   tax affected pro forma net income was million or per share 
pro forma net income from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million or per share 
the pro forma results for the prior year exclude a nonrecurring deferred income tax charge required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  related to our change in tax status from a limited liability company to a c corporation in conjunction with our march initial public offering ipo 
in addition  the pro forma results from continuing operations also assume that we were a publicly traded c corporation for the entire period 
a reconciliation of pro forma net income from continuing operations to gaap net income from continuing operations follows 
see reconciliation of non gaap financial information 
income from continuing operations before income taxes totaled million for the year ended december   down from million for the year ended december  income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december   includes the following items i a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax related to our oregon platform see further discussion below under impairment of goodwill  ii a one time charge of million million after tax related to the termination of our agreement to acquire the bob baker dealerships and iii million million after tax in connection with management changes at our oregon and texas platforms and at the corporate level 
in addition  we experienced an increase in insurance costs of approximately million in approximately of the increase is the result of the full year impact of our directors and officers insurance  which we did not have for most of the first quarter of  as we were not a publicly traded company until march   with the remaining portion of the insurance increase reflecting the overall trend in the insurance environment 
offsetting the increase in insurance costs during are the impact of concentrated expense reduction initiatives focusing on personnel costs and consulting services in the second and third quarters and on dealership advertising in the fourth quarter 
also contributing to the increase in adjusted income from operations was the performance of our arkansas platform  which was underperforming during for the years ended december  increase decrease change revenues in thousands  except for unit data new vehicle data retail revenues same store    retail revenues acquisitions  total new retail revenues    fleet revenues same store    fleet revenues acquisitions total fleet revenues    new vehicle revenue  as reported    new retail units same store   new retail units actual    used vehicle data retail revenues same store    retail revenues acquisitions  total used retail revenues    wholesale revenues same store    wholesale revenues acquisitions  total wholesale revenues    used vehicle revenue  as reported    used retail units same store    used retail units actual    parts  service and collision repair revenues same store    revenues acquisitions  parts  service and collision repair revenue  as reported  finance and insurance  net platform revenues same store    corporate revenues  revenues acquisitions  finance and insurance revenue  as reported   total revenue same store    corporate  acquisitions   total revenue  as reported    same store amounts include the results of dealerships for the identical months for each period presented in the comparison  commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us

on a same store basis  new retail units were down 
however  same store new vehicle retail revenues were up reflecting an increase in our average selling price driven by our strong luxury and mid line import sales mix 
used retail vehicle unit sales increased  despite a decrease on a same store basis 
manufacturer incentive programs on new vehicles and a competitive used vehicle market negatively impacted used retail unit sales volume and sales revenue per used vehicle 
fixed operations increased on a same store basis due to our focus on customer pay business  service adviser training  expansion of our product offerings  implementation of advertising campaigns and growth in our import warranty business 
we achieved same store growth in platform f i  as we continue to benefit from increased product offerings  the utilization of menus in the f i sales process  the maturation of our corporate sponsored programs and the sharing of best practices between our platforms

same store gross profit on new and used retail vehicle sales for the year ended december   decreased as compared to the prior year as competition negatively impacted new vehicle margins and as manufacturer incentive programs on new vehicles reduced the sales volumes of comparatively higher margin used vehicles 
same store finance and insurance platform gross profit pvr increased 
we believe that finance and insurance platform gross profit provides a more accurate measure of our finance and insurance performance than finance and insurance pvr  as it excludes revenue resulting from corporate negotiated contracts  which is not attributable to retail units sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  up from million for the year ended december  sg a as a percentage of gross profit was and for the years ended december  and  respectively

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily related to depreciation of fixed assets acquired during impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess goodwill and other intangibles for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we determined  based on how our business was organized and managed at that time  each of our platforms qualified as a reporting unit for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment 
impairment of goodwill occurs if the net book value of a platform exceeds its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  in connection with our annual impairment test  we determined that the fair value of our oregon platform declined below the its book basis due to the delay in its expected recovery following changes of top level management  the reduction in retail used vehicle sales volumes due to manufacturer rebates and incentives on new vehicles  the delay in the timing of the anticipated recovery of the oregon economy  and the decline in its market share 
we engaged a third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of the oregon platform  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million 
as a result of this charge  our oregon platform s goodwill was reduced to million 
despite the reasons stated above  we expect improvement at our oregon platform in the future through productivity initiatives  recent changes at the top level of management and expense reduction initiatives implemented by the new management team 
while we expect the local economy to recover due to the projected overall improvement in the united states economy  the projections used in our goodwill impairment test do not include the impacts of any such recovery 
we must exercise significant judgment in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and we can provide no assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the performance of our platforms  including our oregon platform  does not meet or exceed the projections of future cash flow used in our impairment analysis 
other income expense floor plan interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to higher average inventory levels during as compared to the increase in non floor plan interest expense of million from the prior year to million was principally attributable to the higher interest rate on our senior subordinated notes due  which were outstanding for the entire year in  as compared to the lower variable rate interest associated with our committed credit facility during income tax provision income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was compared to for the period in subsequent to our march ipo 
excluding the million goodwill impairment charge associated with our oregon platform and the related million tax benefit  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  as we operate nationally  our effective tax rate is dependent upon our geographic revenue mix 
we evaluate our effective tax rate periodically based on our revenue sources 
we will continue to evaluate our effective tax rate in the future  and expect that our annual effective tax rate will fluctuate between and for the year ending december  from january  through the date of our ipo  we were structured as a limited liability company and only provided a tax provision in accordance with sfas no 
for the nine c corporations that we owned directly or indirectly during that period 
effective with our ipo  which closed march   we converted to a corporation and became subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
during the year ended december   we recorded  in accordance with sfas no 
 a one time  non recurring charge of million related to the establishment of a net deferred tax liability  in connection with our conversion 
this liability represented the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the conversion date 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   we completed the sale of five full service automotive dealerships and one ancillary business 
in addition  we closed six thomason select used only lots in oregon and one ancillary business  our four price pilot program used vehicle stores and one full service dealership 
as of december   we were actively pursuing the sale of three franchises and one dealership facility 
the million loss from discontinued operations includes the operating losses of the dealerships mentioned above  as well as a net loss of million on the sale of dealerships and related real estate during of the the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december   was million  which included the results of operations of the dealerships mentioned above and the operating losses and net loss on the sale of five dealerships during year ended december   compared to year december  net income for the year ended december   was million  or per share 
tax affected pro forma net income for the year ended december   was million or per share 
these pro forma results i exclude a non recurring charge of million related to the establishment of a net deferred tax liability associated with our conversion to a corporation and ii include a pro forma tax charge of million as if we were a corporation for the entire period 
tax affected pro forma net income for the year ended december   excluding the after tax losses from discontinued operations of million  was million  or per share  assuming the million shares of our common stock issued in the ipo on march  were offered on january  income from continuing operations before income taxes totaled million for the year ended december   up over the year ended december   after adjusting for the million of goodwill amortization during  as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
required companies to stop amortizing goodwill beginning january  the increase can be primarily attributed to higher retail volumes combined with increased margins on new and used vehicles  the continued strength of both our parts  service and collision repair and finance and insurance businesses  and the impact of lower interest rates on floor plan and non floor plan financing 
included in discontinued operations for the year ended december   was a pre tax loss of million from our price auto stores 
the price pilot program was terminated in the third quarter of tax affected pro forma net income and per share amounts have not been provided for the prior year  as we believe that such comparisons with the current year would not be meaningful due to changes in our tax status

acquisition revenue  net of divestitures  of million accounted for the majority of the increase  as same store revenue was relatively flat on a year to year basis 
same store new retail units were down  while related revenues were up driven by a shift to higher priced vehicles such as suvs  light trucks and minivans 
used retail units were down on a same store basis  as new vehicle incentives continued to attract higher end used car buyers  contributing to an overall weak used car market 
we were able to partially make up for the unit decrease by shifting our mix to higher priced certified used vehicles  light trucks and suvs  resulting in a decline in same store used retail revenues period over period 
fixed operations revenues were up on a same store basis  primarily from successful customer retention and new service product offerings

on june   we signed the first amended and restated credit agreement the arca  retaining all the essential provisions of our original committed credit facility  but reducing the lenders commitment to million and increasing our working capital borrowing capacity from million to million

during the first quarter of  we acquired three of these automotive dealerships  for a total of million  which was funded from our cash on hand 
one of the dealerships acquired is located in sacramento  california  which represents our nd market 
our preliminary purchase price allocation related to these dealerships resulted in million to be allocated to goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights

off balance sheet transactions we had no off balance sheet transactions during the years presented other than those already disclosed in notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require management to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the specific identification method to value our vehicle inventories and the first in  first out method fifo to account for our parts inventories 
we maintain a reserve for specific inventory units where cost basis exceeds fair value 
these reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in assessing lower of cost or market for new vehicles  we primarily consider the aging of vehicles along with the timing of annual and model changeovers 
the assessment of lower of cost or market for used vehicles considers recent data and trends such as loss histories  current aging of the inventory and current market conditions 
notes receivable finance contracts as of december  and  we had outstanding notes receivable from finance contracts of million and million  respectively net of an allowance for credit losses of million and million  respectively 
these notes have initial terms ranging from to months  and are collateralized by the related vehicles 
the assessment of our allowance for credit losses considers historical loss ratios and the performance of the current portfolio with respect to past due accounts 
we continually analyze our current portfolio against our historical performance 
in addition  we attribute minimal value to the underlying collateral in our assessment of the reserve 
chargeback reserve we receive commissions from the sale of various insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers and through the arrangement of financing vehicles for customers 
we may be charged back chargeback for such commissions in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
the revenues from financing fees and commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future chargebacks is established at that time 
the reserve considers our historical chargeback experience  including timing  as well as national industry trends 
this data is evaluated on a product by product basis 
these reserves were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets our intangible assets relate primarily to goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights associated with acquisitions of dealerships  which we account for under the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
the operations of the acquired dealerships are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income commencing on the date of acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets  which are deemed to have indefinite lives  but test these assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if any event occurs or circumstances change that indicate possible impairment 
we have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no legal  contractual  economic or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers brand names 
goodwill and franchise rights are allocated to each reporting unit at the platform and dealership level  respectively 
the fair market value of our manufacturer franchise rights is determined at the acquisition date through discounting the projected cash flows attributable to each franchise 
goodwill represents the excess cost of the businesses acquired over the fair market value of the identifiable net assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we determined that each of our platforms qualified as a reporting unit as we operated in one segment  and our platforms are one level below our corporate level  discrete financial information existed for each platform and the management of each platform directly reviewed the platform s performance 
we are continuously adapting our operating structure and searching for ways to standardize policies  share best practices and centralize administrative functions 
in the future  if we determine that our platforms no longer meet the requirements of a reporting unit  we will reevaluate the reporting units with respect to the changes in our reporting structure 
we review platform goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
the first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairments by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its corresponding net book value  including goodwill 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test determines the potential impairment loss by comparing the estimated fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount  the carrying value of goodwill is adjusted to reflect its estimated fair value 
as a result  a severe and sustained reduction in one of our platform s operations could lead to an impairment charge 
we performed our annual impairment test as of october   and recorded a goodwill impairment pre tax charge associated with our oregon platform of million in accordance with sfas no 
all other intangible assets are deemed to have definite lives and are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the asset ranging from years and are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired 
related party transactions certain of our directors  shareholders and their affiliates  and platform management  have engaged in transactions with us 
these transactions primarily relate to long term operating leases of facilities 
this practice is fairly common in the automotive retail industry 
rent expense attributable to related parties was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and future minimum payments under related party long term non cancelable operating leases as of december   were million 
we believe that these transactions and our other related party transactions  as described below  involved terms comparable to terms that would be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
for the years ended december   and  million  million and million  respectively  was paid to an advertising entity in which one of our directors had a minority interest 
during and  we paid million and million  respectively  in legal fees to a law firm in which one of our directors was of counsel 
in  we sold land to one of our directors for million and entered into a long term operating lease with the director for the property 
the land is contiguous to other property owned by this director  for which we currently have long term operating leases 
we purchased the land for million in january in  we acquired one dealership facility consisting on five franchises from an executive of one of our platforms for million 
in  we acquired land from one of our directors for million for the purpose of expanding the operations of one of our dealerships facilities and for the construction of a new body shop facility 
we have an option to acquire certain properties from one of our shareholders  which we currently lease 
the purchase option  initially based on the aggregate appraised value  adjusts each year for movements in the consumer price index 
the purchase option of million as of december   can only be exercised in total 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities vies  an interpretation of apb no 
 fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin  as amended in december  is effective in the first quarter of the adoption of fin will not impact our results of operations  financial position or financial statement disclosures as we have no vies 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on july   had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or financial statement disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments be classified as liabilities that were previously considered equity 
the adoption of this standard on july   as required  had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or financial statement disclosures 
reconciliation of non gaap financial information tax affected pro forma net income for analysis purposes  in management s discussion and analysis we discuss pro forma net income from continuing operations and related earnings per share for the twelve months ended december  the consolidated statement of income reconciles gaap net income to tax affected pro forma net income by assuming that we were taxed as a c corporation for all months of and excluding the one time charge for our conversion from a limited liability company to a corporation

during  we renegotiated a contract with one of our third party finance and insurance product providers  which resulted in the recognition of income that was not attributable to retail vehicles sold during the year 
we believe that platform finance and insurance  which excludes the additional revenue derived from contracts negotiated by our corporate office  provides a more accurate measure of our finance and insurance operating performance 
the following table reconciles finance and insurance gross profit to platform finance and insurance gross profit  and provides the necessary components to calculate platform finance and insurance gross profit pvr in thousands  except for unit and per vehicle data for the year ended december  finance and insurance gross profit  net as reported  less corporate finance and insurance gross profit  platform finance and insurance gross profit  platform finance and insurance gross profit pvr retail units sold new retail units  used retail units  total  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
based on million of variable rate long term debt including the current portion outstanding at december   a change in interest rates would result in a change of approximately million to our annual other interest expense 
based on floor plan amounts outstanding at december   a change in the interest rates would result in a million change to annual floor plan interest expense 
we received interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers of million for the year ended december   which is reflected as a reduction in the cost of inventory on the balance sheet 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan credits  it is our expectation  based on historical data  that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers 
interest rate hedges we use interest rate swaps to manage our capital structure 
in december  we entered into two forward interest rate swaps with a combined notional principal amount of million  which will provide a hedge against changes in the interest rates of our variable rate floor plan notes payable for a period of eight years beginning in march the swap agreements were designated and qualify as interest rate hedges of future changes in interest rates of our variable rate floor plan indebtedness and we expect that these hedges will contain minor ineffectiveness once they become effective in march as of december   the swaps had a fair value of million  which was included in other assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
during december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional principal amount of million as a hedge against changes in the fair value of our senior subordinated notes due under the terms of swap agreement  we are is required to make variable rate payments based on six month libor and receive a fixed rate of 
this swap agreement was designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge of our fixed rate senior subordinated debt and did not contain any ineffectiveness 
as of december   the swap agreement had a fair value of million  which was included in other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
during the second quarter of and in connection with the issuance of our subrodinated notes due  we terminated three swap agreements  having a combined total notional principal amount of million  all maturing in november in connection with these terminations  we incurred a loss of million which was amortized to interest expense over the remainder of the original term of the agreement
