item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ensco international incorporated and subsidiaries ensco or the company is an international offshore contract drilling company with a fleet of drilling rigs  including jackup rigs  seven barge rigs  five platform rigs and one semisubmersible rig 
the company s offshore contract drilling operations are integral to the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas and the company is one of the leading providers of offshore drilling services to the international oil and gas industry 
the company drills and completes oil and gas wells under contracts with major international  government owned and independent oil and gas companies 
the drilling services provided by the company are conducted on a day rate contract basis  under which the company provides its drilling rigs and rig crews and receives a fixed amount per day for drilling wells 
the customer bears substantially all of the ancillary costs of constructing the wells and supporting drilling operations  as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the wells 
demand for the company s services is significantly affected by regional and worldwide levels of offshore exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies 
offshore exploration and development spending levels may fluctuate substantially from year to year and from region to region 
such spending fluctuations result from many factors  including demand for oil and gas  regional and global economic conditions and expected changes therein  political and legislative environments in the us and other major oil producing countries  production levels and related activities of opec and other oil and gas producers  and the impact that these and other events have on the current and expected future pricing of oil and natural gas 
the company s drilling rigs are deployed throughout the world  with drilling operations concentrated in the major geographic regions of north america  europe africa  asia pacific and south america caribbean 
the company competes with other offshore drilling contractors on the basis of price  quality of service  operational and safety performance  equipment suitability and availability  reputation and technical expertise 
competition is usually on a regional basis  but offshore drilling rigs are mobile and may be moved from one region to another in response to demand 
business environment the company s domestic offshore drilling operations are conducted in the gulf of mexico 
the us oil and natural gas market and trends in oil and gas company spending largely determine domestic offshore drilling industry conditions 
natural gas prices decreased in from record levels during  and oil and gas company gulf of mexico drilling budgets were sharply reduced over the course of the gulf of mexico drilling budgets remained at moderate levels during and demand for jackup drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico was significantly lower than that realized in early during  some jackup rigs departed the gulf of mexico for international service  however  the supply of jackup rigs remained in excess of demand 
as a result of this imbalance  day rates were significantly lower in than they were in early demand for jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico decreased during the first half of as oil and gas companies focused more of their spending on international projects 
however  demand improved somewhat in the second half of as the supply of jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico declined when certain rigs mobilized to international markets in response to contract opportunities 
day rates for gulf of mexico jackup rigs improved over the course of mainly due to a reduction in the supply of rigs 
industry conditions in most international offshore drilling markets improved moderately during and  as many of the major international and government owned oil companies increased spending in those markets 
although oil prices declined somewhat over the course of  increased drilling activity related to major natural gas development projects in asia pacific and the middle east contributed to increased demand for jackup drilling rigs in those regions 
demand and day rates for international jackup rigs strengthened during and much of  particularly in europe and asia pacific 
however  in the second half of  day rates began to decrease modestly in europe 
demand and day rates for jackup rigs in europe remained fairly stable over the first half of as rigs mobilized into strong markets to meet demand 
however  day rates for jackup rigs in europe declined during the second half of due to limited term work opportunities 
day rates remained fairly stable in asia pacific over the course of  however  activity levels declined during the fourth quarter of due to the completion of several programs prior to resumption of activity in the first quarter of results of operations on february   the company reached an agreement to sell its vessel marine transportation fleet 
after receipt of various regulatory consents  the transaction was finalized on april   for approximately million 
the company recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million related to the sale transaction 
the results of operations of the marine transportation fleet have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for each of the years in the three year period ended december  on august   the company completed its merger with chiles offshore inc chiles  which has been accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  with the company treated as the acquirer 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each chiles shareholder received of a share of the company s common stock and in cash in exchange for each share of chiles common stock held 
upon completion of the transaction  the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock and paid approximately million in cash to the holders of chiles common stock 
the company s financial statements include the operating results of chiles from the august  acquisition date 
the acquired chiles operations consisted of a fleet of five ultra premium jackup rigs  including two rigs operating in the gulf of mexico  one rig operating offshore australia  one rig operating offshore trinidad and tobago  and one rig under construction that subsequently entered service in the gulf of mexico during december the acquisition of chiles further strengthened the company s position in the premium jackup market  which the company believes currently represents one of the strongest segments of the offshore drilling market 
the company s consolidated operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   is as follows in millions revenues 


operating expenses contract drilling 


depreciation and amortization 


impairment of assets

in  net income for the company increased by million  or  and operating income increased by million  or  as compared to these increases are due primarily to a million impairment charge in relating to the company s venezuela based assets and the addition of the five rigs acquired from chiles to the company s rig fleet in the third quarter of approximately million of the million increase in operating income is attributable to the five rigs acquired from chiles 
in  net income for the company decreased by million  or  and operating income decreased by million  or  as compared to these decreases are primarily due to a decrease in average day rates for the company s north america jackup rig fleet  which reduced revenue by approximately million from  a million increase in impairment charges associated with the company s venezuela based assets  and million of revenue in from the early termination of long term contracts for two of the company s barge rigs in venezuela 
these decreases were partially offset by the operating results from the five jackup rigs acquired from chiles and the newly constructed ensco  which were added to the company s rig fleet in the third quarter of and generated an aggregate million of operating income during detailed explanations of the company s operating results for the three years in the period ended december   including discussions of revenue and contract drilling expenses based on geographical location and type of rig  are set forth below

lake maracaibo market conditions have been depressed for several years due to reduced or deferred exploration and development spending by venezuela s national oil company  petroleos de venezuela  sa pdvsa 
in addition  the economic and political situation in venezuela has become increasingly unstable during recent years 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding its south america caribbean barge rig fleet  the company has evaluated the carrying value of the barge rigs for impairment on a regular basis during recent years 
during the fourth quarter of  the economic and political environment in venezuela deteriorated severely 
a strike originating within pdvsa spread nationwide  involving the entire oil industry and the banking system  and causing substantial economic upheaval 
the strike  mass terminations of pdvsa employees  and political interference in the management of pdvsa resulted in the near shutdown of the venezuelan oil industry

as a substantial majority of such expenditures are elective  the company expects to be able to maintain adequate liquidity throughout future business cycles through the deferral or acceleration of its future capital investments  as necessary 
accordingly  while future operating cash flow cannot be accurately predicted  management believes its long term liquidity will continue to be funded primarily by operating cash flow 
market risk the company uses various methods to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company predominantly structures its drilling rig contracts in us dollars  which significantly reduces the portion of the company s cash flows and assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the company also employs various strategies  including the use of derivative instruments  to match foreign currency denominated assets with equal or near equal amounts of foreign currency denominated liabilities  thereby minimizing exposure to earnings fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company occasionally utilizes derivative instruments to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
at december   the company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding to exchange million us dollars for australian dollars and great britain pounds 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the company occasionally uses interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the variable interest rate on debt to a fixed rate  and interest rate lock agreements to hedge against increases in interest rates on pending financing 
at december   the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements or interest rate lock agreements 
in connection with the acquisition of chiles on august   the company obtained million notional amount of outstanding treasury rate lock agreements that were scheduled to mature in october upon acquisition  the company designated approximately million notional amount of the treasury rate lock agreements as an effective hedge against the variability in cash flows of million of marad guaranteed bonds the company intended to issue in october the company deemed the remaining million notional amount of treasury rate lock agreements obtained in the chiles acquisition to be speculative in nature 
the company subsequently settled the million notional amount of treasury rate lock agreements deemed as speculative in october million and june million 
the company settled the million notional amount of treasury rate lock agreements designated as an effective hedge in october in connection with the pricing and subsequent issuance of the marad bonds 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company utilizes derivative instruments and undertakes hedging activities in accordance with its established policies for the management of market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
management believes that the company s use of derivative instruments and related hedging activities do not expose the company to any material interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  credit risk or any other market rate or price risk 
outlook changes in industry conditions and the corresponding impact on the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted because of the short term nature of many of the company s contracts and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which impact expenditures for oil and gas drilling 
whether recent levels of regional and worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling will increase  decrease or remain unchanged  is not determinable at this time 
management s current plans and expectations relative to its major areas of operations and near term industry conditions are detailed below 
rig construction on february   the company entered into an agreement with keppel fels limited kfels to exchange three rigs ensco  ensco and ensco and million for the construction of a new high performance premium jackup rig to be named ensco the ensco will be an enhanced kfels mod v b design modified to ensco specifications and a sister rig to the ensco  which is currently under construction in singapore 
the ensco  which is being constructed under a joint venture with kfels  is expected to be delivered by year end  and delivery of the ensco is expected in late the transaction is subject to execution of a definitive construction contract and regulatory approvals 
the ensco is currently working in the gulf of mexico and is expected to be transferred to kfels in may  upon completion of its contractual commitment 
the ensco and ensco  two idle platform rigs  are expected to be transferred to kfels simultaneously with  or before  transfer of the ensco north america management continues to evaluate the relocation of jackup rigs from the gulf of mexico 
the company has moved three of its gulf of mexico based jackup rigs to pursue international opportunities during the past months and management currently anticipates the international deployment of at least two additional jackup rigs during the company continues its program of upgrading its gulf of mexico jackup rig fleet 
the ensco is currently in a shipyard undergoing major enhancements and is projected to return to service in october the company plans to commence enhancement procedures on at least four additional gulf of mexico jackup rigs during  with shipyard durations of at least four months each 
the ensco  the company s deep water semisubmersible rig  completed an approximate three year contract on february  and is currently being marketed at a day rate of approximately  as of february   one of the company s five platform rigs is operating under a contract scheduled for completion in april as discussed above  two of the four idle platform rigs are pending sale and transfer in connection with the construction of the ensco the company s platform rigs have experienced utilization in the to range during the previous five years  primarily as a result of reduced opportunities for deep well drilling contracts 
the company s platform rigs  which are all capable of completing  to  feet wells  are best suited for long term  deep well drilling applications where the platform rig components will stay in place for a substantial period of time 
the company s platform rigs currently compete against smaller  easier to mobilize and assemble  self erecting platform rigs for shallow well drilling 
the company is not able to predict when there will be a recovery of drilling activity that will require increased use of the class of platform rigs owned and operated by the company 
the company evaluated the carrying values of its platform rigs in december and determined such carrying values were not impaired 
the company will continue to perform such evaluations as circumstances dictate 
europe africa as of february   all eight of the company s jackup rigs in the europe africa region are working 
however  three of these rigs with contract completions scheduled in march do not have commitments for subsequent work 
management currently anticipates idle time for some or all of these three rigs in the near term 
asia pacific as of february   of the company s rigs in the asia pacific region are operating and both idle rigs have contractual commitments to commence working in march the company currently has substantial backlog in the asia pacific region  with nine of the rigs committed through the fourth quarter of or later 
the company plans to increase the size of its asia pacific fleet during through the relocation of at least two jackup rigs from the gulf of mexico 
allowing for mobilization and shipyard procedures upon arrival  management does not expect any rigs relocated from the gulf of mexico to be available for service in the asia pacific region until the second half of south america caribbean the company s jackup rig working offshore trinidad and tobago  the ensco  continues operations under a contract scheduled for completion in september as of february   five of the company s six barge rigs located in venezuela are idle and the ensco ii  which is currently working  is scheduled to complete its contract in may due to the deterioration in the political and economic environment in venezuela  the company believes the timing of a recovery of drilling activity in venezuela is uncertain and unlikely in the near term 
the company evaluated the carrying values of its barge rigs in december and determined such carrying values were not impaired 
the company will continue to perform such evaluations and monitor the situation in venezuela  as circumstances dictate 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires the company s management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the company s management in their application  have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies are those related to property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
property and equipment at december   the carrying value of the company s property and equipment totaled  million  which represents of total assets 
this carrying value reflects the application of the company s property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgments by management relative to the capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of the company s rigs 
the company develops and applies property and equipment accounting policies that are designed to appropriately and consistently capitalize those costs incurred to enhance  improve and extend the useful lives of its assets and expense those costs incurred to repair or maintain the existing condition or useful lives of its assets 
the development and application of such policies requires judgment and assumptions by management relative to the nature of  and benefits from  expenditures on company assets 
the company establishes property and equipment accounting policies that are designed to depreciate or amortize its assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments used by management in determining the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of its assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives of the company s rigs and vessels  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of its property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
generally  extended periods of idle time and or inability to contract assets at economical rates are an indication that an asset may be impaired 
however  the offshore drilling industry is highly cyclical and it is not unusual for assets to be unutilized or underutilized for significant periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change 
likewise  during periods of supply and demand imbalance  assets are frequently contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods of time until demand comes back into balance with supply 
impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual assets  groups of assets  such as a type of drilling rig  or assets in a certain geographic location 
the company s assets are mobile and may be moved from markets with excess supply  if economically feasible 
the company s jackup rigs and semisubmersible rig are suited for  and accessible to  broad and numerous markets throughout the world 
however  there are fewer economically feasible markets available to the company s barge rigs and platform rigs 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the first quarter of  the company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the goodwill impairment test requires the company to identify reporting units and estimate the fair value of those units as of the testing date 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting units is determined to be less than their carrying value  the company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
based on the company s test performed as of december   there was no impairment of goodwill 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by the company s drilling rigs  and are based on management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and operations  as well as management s estimates of future expected utilization  contract rates  expense levels and capital requirements of the company s drilling rigs 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments used by management in the application of the company s asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational  industry  economic and political environments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  judgments and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
income taxes the company conducts operations and earns income in numerous foreign countries and is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries  as well as us federal and state tax laws 
at december   the company has a million net deferred income tax liability and million of accrued liabilities for income taxes currently payable 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of the company s income tax accounting policies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income  as well as management s judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of sfas the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management s interpretation of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes  especially those involving the deployment of tax planning strategies  may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations
