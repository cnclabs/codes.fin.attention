item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis is based on  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  particularly note of notes to consolidated financial statements which presents net sales and revenues and operating income by operating segment 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements or disclosed in the related notes thereto 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from management s estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue based on the recognition criteria set forth in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
homebuilding the company s homebuilding operations involve three principal types of homebuilding transactions a 
selling a home constructed for consumers on real estate owned by the consumer on your lot sales  b 
selling modular homes constructed in a factory principally to distributors for re sale to consumers modular sales  c 
selling a home constructed for consumers on real estate owned by the consumer but encumbered by a previous borrowing real estate sales  sales for cash at closing do occasionally occur for each of the above categories 
however  except for modular sales  most sales involve some form of seller financing 
on your lot sales constitute the majority of the sales in the homebuilding business approximately of new units sold in 
since the real estate land is already owned by the customer and is not financed by the company  these transactions represent sales of personal property financed by instalment sales contracts notes 
revenue from the construction and sale of a home is recognized upon completion of construction and legal transfer of ownership to the customer 
modular sales are the second largest component of homebuilding sales 
these sales are made principally to distributors for resale to consumers and do not involve sales of real estate 
sales are made under various customary industrial credit terms  with receivables due within to days following delivery 
revenue is recognized when legal ownership has transferred and upon delivery to the distributor or to a customer site 
for real estate sales  the company finances both a home and the related real estate 
revenues on real estate sales are recognized by the full accrual method in accordance with sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  when a 
the sale is consummated at closing with the customer after construction is completed and legal transfer of ownership has occurred 
b 
the buyer s initial cash investment is no less than of the sales value 
the buyer s continuing investment is required to be a level monthly payment sufficient to amortize the borrowing over a term not to exceed years 
c 
the company s receivable is secured by a first mortgage and is not subject to future subordination 
d 
the company transfers to the buyer the risks and rewards of ownership and does not have any continuing involvement with the property 
financing within the financing segment  msh purchases and services mortgage instalment notes originated by jwh and wmc offers financing to homebuyers that is secured by mortgages and liens 
references to instalment notes or mortgage instalment notes include mortgage loans offered by wmc 
instalment notes receivable from the sale of jwh s homes are initially recorded at the discounted value of the future instalment note payments using an imputed interest rate in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 interest on receivables and payables  apb 
the imputed interest rate used represents the estimated prevailing market rate of interest for credit of similar terms issued to customers with similar credit ratings to jwh s customers 
the company estimates this rate by adding a credit spread and a margin to a benchmark funding rate in order to cover costs and expected losses 
this rate is periodically compared to rates charged by competitors and other lenders to customers of similar credit quality to validate that the methodology results in a market rate of interest 
these estimates affect revenue recognition by determining the allocation of income between the amount recognized by the homebuilding segment from the construction of the home and the amount recognized by the financing segment over the life of the instalment note as interest income 
variations in the estimated market rate of interest used to initially record instalment notes receivable could affect the amount and timing of income recognition in each of these segments 
instalment note payoffs received in advance of scheduled maturity prepayments cause interest income to increase due to the recognition of remaining unamortized discounts arising from the application of abp at the note s inception 
the interest income on instalment notes generated by both msh and wmc is recognized using the interest method 
the legal instruments used in each company allow for different amounts to be charged to the customer for late fees and ultimately recognized as revenue 
jwh offers instalment notes  which state the maximum amount to be charged to the customer  and ultimately recognized as revenue  based on the contractual number of payments and dollar amount of monthly payments 
wmc offers mortgage loans that have fixed monthly payments and repayment terms similar to instalment notes 
both msh and wmc have the ability to levy costs to protect their collateral position upon default  such as attorney fees and late charges as allowed by state law 
instalment notes and mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status when any portion of the principal or interest is ninety days past due 
when placed on non accrual status  the related interest receivable is reversed against interest income of the current period 
instalment notes are removed from non accrual status when the amount financed and the associated interest income become current 
recoveries of advanced taxes and insurance related to instalment notes are recognized as income when collected 
the financing segment sells homes and related real estate repossessed or foreclosed on by the company from customers in default of their loans or notes to the company repo sales 
repo sales involve the sale and financing of both a home and related real estate 
revenues from repo sales are recognized in accordance with sfas by the full accrual method where appropriate 
however  the requirement for a minimum initial cash investment per sfas frequently is not met 
when this is the case  losses are immediately recognized  and gains are deferred and recognized by the installment method until the buyer s investment reaches the minimum 
at that time  revenue is recognized by the full accrual method 
industrial products for shipments via rail or truck  revenue is recognized when title passes upon delivery to the customer 
revenue earned for shipments via ocean vessel is recognized under international shipping standards as defined by incoterms when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
natural resources for coal shipments via rail  revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the railcar is loaded 
revenue earned for coal shipments via ocean vessel is recognized under international shipping standards as defined by incoterms when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
for the company s methane gas operations  revenues are recognized when the gas has been transferred to the customers pipeline  at which time transfer of title occurs 
other for products shipped via rail or truck  revenue is recognized when the product is placed on the rail or in the truck  which is when risk of loss and title transfers to the customer 
land sales are recognized as revenue when legal transfer of ownership to the buyer occurs  which is at closing 
given the diversity of the company s businesses  many transactions have unique characteristics  which have to be analyzed on a case by case basis 
this diversity of products and contracts can lead to variations in the timing of income recognition 
however  most transactions are not individually significant  nor could they materially impact earnings 
allowances for losses allowances for losses on trade and other accounts receivables are based  in large part  upon judgments and estimates of expected losses and specific identification of problem trade accounts and other receivables 
significantly weaker than anticipated industry or economic conditions could impact customers ability to pay such that actual losses are greater than the amounts provided for in these allowances 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on instalment notes is based on the company s past loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  delinquencies  the estimated value of the underlying real estate collateral and current economic and market conditions within the applicable geographic areas surrounding the underlying real estate 
the allowance for losses on instalment notes and mortgage loans is increased by provisions for losses charged to income and is reduced by charge offs net of recoveries 
employee benefits the company provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions including the following pension benefits other benefits december  december  december  december  weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase n a n a weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase assumed health care cost trend rates health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate the discount rate used to determine pension and other post retirement expense was decreased to from used in in addition  the rate of return on plan assets used to determine the pension expense decreased to from 
the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the company s expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which was modeled based on the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed health care cost trend rates  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and health care plans 
a one percentage point change in the trend rate for these assumptions would have the following effects in thousands percentage point increase percentage point decrease health care cost trend effect on total of service and interest cost components  effect on postretirement benefit obligation   discount rate effect on postretirement service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation   effect on current year postretirement expense effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation   effect on current year pension expense   expected return on plan assets effect on current year pension expense   rate of compensation increase effect on pension service and interest cost components  effect on pension benefit obligation   effect on current year pension expense   the company also has significant liabilities for uninsured or partially insured employee related liabilities  including workers compensation liabilities  miners black lung benefit liabilities and liabilities for various life and health benefits 
the recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience 
workers compensation and black lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used 
changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience  changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted workers compensation liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted black lung liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
litigation  investigations and claims the company is involved in litigation  investigations  and claims arising out of the normal conduct of its business  including those relating to commercial transactions  as well as environmental  health and safety matters 
the company estimates and accrues its liabilities resulting from such matters based on a variety of factors  including outstanding legal claims and proposed settlements  assessments by internal counsel of pending or threatened litigation  and assessments of potential environmental liabilities and remediation costs 
the company believes it has adequately accrued for these potential liabilities  however facts and circumstances may change that could cause the actual liability to exceed the estimates  or that may require adjustments to the recorded liability balances in the future 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is in dispute with the internal revenue service the irs on a number of federal income tax issues 
the company believes that its tax filing positions have substantial merit and it intends to vigorously defend these positions 
the company has established accruals that it feels are sufficient to address claims  including related interest and penalties  where its defense may be unsuccessful or where a settlement of issues may be warranted 
the amount of the accrual is based on an assessment by management of both the probability and extent of loss for each of the disputed issues involved 
since the issues involved are highly complex  are subject to the uncertainties of extensive litigation and or administrative processes and may require an extended period of time to reach ultimate resolution  it is possible that management s estimate of this liability could change 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
goodwill and other intangibles are also reviewed for possible impairment at least annually 
the company uses estimates of future cash flows of the related asset  asset grouping or reporting unit in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
changes in actual or estimated future cash flows could have an impact on the recoverability of such assets  resulting in future impairment charges

year ended december  and overview in  the company made significant progress in one of its key strategic initiatives reducing the complexity of the company and increasing the focus on key core businesses by completing divestitures of its aimcor and jw aluminum businesses 
the sale of these businesses in december generated net proceeds of approximately million  which was principally used to reduce outstanding borrowings and to increase cash and cash equivalents 
as a result of the sales  aimcor and jw aluminum have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the company s financial statements 
discontinued operations for the year ended december  produced a net loss of million  or per diluted share  including a net loss on the sale of aimcor and jw aluminum of million  or per diluted share 
income from discontinued operations for was million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  in the company s remaining businesses experienced very difficult operating conditions in income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share 
this compares to income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share in principal factors impacting results as compared to included fewer unit completions and higher costs in the homebuilding segment 
despite a slight increase in credit losses  continued stable operating results in the financing segment 
lower volumes and significant increases in scrap metal and other costs in the industrial products segment 
the end of a price war in the industrial products segment  reflected in the ability to implement several price increases in the second half of the year

continuing operations net sales and revenues for the year ended december  were billion  substantially the same as in revenue decreases within the industrial products and other segments were offset by increases in the homebuilding and natural resources segments 
industrial products segment revenues decreased due to lower pipe  valve  hydrant and fittings volumes  partially offset by price increases 
the volume decline  believed to be a temporary reduction in market share  occurred during the course of the year as us pipe instituted multiple price increases 
these price increases were in response to rising scrap metal and other costs and an easing of the intense pricing competition within the industry that occurred in revenues for the other segment declined on lower sales volume for sloss  partially offset by higher pricing for furnace coke and increased sales of land 
homebuilding revenues improved on higher average selling prices  partially offset by lower unit completions 
revenues were higher in natural resources due to an increase in coal tons sold and higher natural gas prices  partially offset by a decrease in natural gas volumes and slightly lower coal prices 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation  of million was of net sales in versus million and of net sales in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increased costs of lumber and other building materials in the homebuilding segment  higher scrap metal  alloy  natural gas and other costs in the industrial products segment and higher production costs in the natural resources segment 
depreciation for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million compared with primarily due to increases at homebuilding and financing related to implementations of new enterprise systems  and at natural resources due to capital expenditures for mining equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase in expenses occurred mostly in the homebuilding segment as a result of higher costs related to a reorganization of the sales and construction organizations  as well as the implementation of a new enterprise system and new initiatives designed to drive future growth  such as new home gallery expansion and higher advertising expenses 
in addition  there was an increase in environmental related expenses at sloss of approximately million 
the increased costs in the current period were partially offset by productivity and cost reduction programs in place throughout the company 
the prior period included a million charge to bad debt expense related to a sloss customer that filed for bankruptcy protection  as well as higher professional fees related to restating mid state home s accounting for interest income on instalment notes to the interest method 
provision for losses on instalment notes increased to million in  compared to million in due principally to anticipated increases in the estimated level of losses  as indicated by an increase in the number of repossessions and slightly higher losses on resales of repossessed homes

interest expense was million in  a decrease of million compared with interest expense on mortgage backed asset backed notes was million in  compared to million in this reflected lower interest rates  partially offset by higher borrowings 
corporate senior debt interest expense was million in versus million in this increase resulted from higher interest rates on the facility beginning in april  as compared to the previous facility  as well as the accelerated recognition of million of term loan debt issue costs and discount amortization as a result of mandatory debt repayments required by the sale of aimcor and jw aluminum in december litigation expense of million in principally relates to the settlement of a class action employment matter at us pipe 
the company recorded approximately million in restructuring and impairment charges during related to the cessation of various operations in the industrial products segment  the anticipated closure of mine no 
in the natural resources segment  and a write down of the company s former headquarters building to its net realizable value prior to its sale 
the company s effective income tax rate for the year ended december  differed from the federal statutory tax rate due to a reduction of income tax accruals as a result of the favorable settlement of a dispute with the irs  a deduction for depletion related to the company s mining operations  the effect of state and foreign income taxes and amortization of goodwill 
in july  the company favorably resolved a longstanding dispute with the irs concerning federal income tax returns for fiscal years ended may  and the irs had previously disallowed deductions of million and related legal fees of million associated with the settlement of veil piercing litigation in the bankruptcy proceedings 
the company successfully defended its position through an irs appeals process  and will not be required to pay income taxes related to this issue 
the company had previously established accruals for both federal income taxes and interest associated with this issue that were no longer required 
accordingly  the company recorded reductions of million and million to interest expense and income tax expense  respectively  in the statement of operations 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  of differed from the federal statutory tax rate due to a million tax benefit related to the november sale of jw window components  a deduction for depletion related to the company s mining operations and the utilization of a nonconventional fuel credit 
the million tax benefit was from an increased capital loss carryforward due to a change in the consolidated return loss disallowance rules  which favorably affected the company s previous treatment of the november sale of jw window components 
the current and prior period results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis homebuilding net sales and revenues were million during  an increase of million  or  from the prior period 
as compared to the prior year  average net selling prices increased in  but were partially offset by fewer home completions 
average net selling prices increased as a result of the company s on going strategy to market and sell new product options  amenity upgrades and larger  more upscale models 
excluding the modular business   homes were completed in  compared to  in this reduction principally reflects market conditions that were weaker in the company s historical affordable housing  credit challenged customer base  as compared to the broader homebuilding industry 
the company s modular business completed homes during  less than in this reduction reflects a weak economic environment in the carolinas  the market area served by this business 
for the year ended december  homes completed   average net selling price   operating income was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the million decrease was principally caused by fewer unit completions  higher lumber and other material costs  and expenses related to significant investments in a major advertising campaign  a reorganization of the sales and construction organizations  and installation of a new enterprise system during  partially offset by increases in average selling prices 
the company anticipates lower year over year unit completions and operating income in the first half of as a result of weaker new sales contract activity in the fourth quarter of the homebuilding segment has recently introduced new home models in higher price point ranges  new advertising and promotion programs and new incentive programs in an effort to increase new sales contract activity and  ultimately  to improve unit completions 
financing net sales and revenues were million in  a decrease of million from the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to lower interest income earned on restricted cash balances due to lower interest rates  partially offset by higher insurance revenues 
operating income was million in  compared to million in the year ago period 
the decrease was a result of an increase in the provision for losses on instalment notes receivables due to anticipated higher losses resulting from a record level of bankruptcies and related foreclosures that will continue to move through the repossession and resale process 
income was also impacted by increased expenses related to higher commissions paid for insurance placed on customer homes and costs related to the implementation of new financial systems 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in interest expense  principally as a result of a reduction in the interest rates on borrowings 
in addition  there was an increase in interest income on instalment notes from higher prepayment speeds as a result of increased recognition of unamortized discount that occurs when payoffs are received in advance of maturity 
prepayment speeds were in compared to in the prior year 
delinquencies the percentage of amounts outstanding over days past due at december  were of net instalment balances outstanding 
delinquencies based on gross instalment balances was at december   compared to at december  repossession inventory units at december  increased to units million  compared to units million at december  this increase is attributable to higher levels of bankruptcies and the company s efforts to accelerate foreclosure activity during and industrial products net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower pipe  valve  hydrant and fittings volumes  partially offset by price increases 
total us pipe tons shipped were down in compared to the prior year 
the volume decline  believed to be a temporary reduction in market share  occurred during the course of the year as us pipe instituted multiple price increases 
these price increases were in response to rising scrap metal and other costs and an easing of the intense pricing competition within the industry that occurred in the first of the price increases took effect mid june  the second october  and a third took effect january  us pipe also recently announced a fourth price increase scheduled to take effect march  the average price per ton at us pipe was up in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  reflecting the impact of the first two price increases 
the operating loss of million for was a million deterioration from operating income of million for operating income decreased as a result of lower volumes  higher scrap metal costs million  increased litigation accruals principally related to an employment matter at us pipe million  increased workers compensation costs million and increased natural gas costs million 
segment results also reflected million to settle a commercial dispute during that had previously been accrued in the other segment and  accordingly  there was no net impact on consolidated results of operations 
in addition  us pipe recorded a restructuring charge related to ceasing production and manufacturing operations at the us pipe anniston casting plant million  which is more fully described below 
major increases in the cost of scrap metal occurred at us pipe in scrap metal is a primary raw material in the production of ductile iron pipe  accounting for up to of the costs of producing pipe 
historically averaging per net ton or less in cost  scrap metal cost averaged in excess of per ton in recent purchases  through early march  have been for as high as per net ton 
unparalleled scrap export volume  especially to china  has been the principal reason for the record high costs of scrap metal 
the company expects that the price increases it has already implemented or announced will largely offset the increases in cost that have occurred and will enable the company  in the second half of  to return to profitability levels that existed before s price war and the recent increases in scrap costs 
the company s ability to achieve these results is dependent on its ability to pass along recent and future increases in scrap costs to customers in the form of price increases 
this ability could be affected by the reactions of customers or competitors to these price increases 
on april   us pipe ceased production and manufacturing operations at its us castings plant in anniston  alabama 
the decision to cease operations was the result of several years of declining financial results and increased foreign competition and resulted in the termination of employees 
exit costs associated with the plant closure are estimated to be million and such costs will be incurred within twelve months 
estimated costs associated with the restructuring are as follows in thousands total expected costs restructuring and impairment charges expensed for the year ended december  termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs restructuring charges   impairment charge write off of fixed assets and related parts and materials total   other associated costs principally include site clean up costs that will be expensed as incurred 
it is anticipated that cessation of the castings operations will result in improvements to operating income 
natural resources net sales and revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the million in the prior year 
the increase in net sales and revenues is attributable to an increase in coal tons sold and an increase in natural gas selling prices  partially offset by a decrease in natural gas volumes and slightly lower coal prices 
for the year ended december  average natural gas selling price per mcf billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of natural gas wells average coal selling price per ton tons of coal sold in millions the average natural gas selling prices shown for are net of approximately million of losses on hedges of natural gas anticipated production and sales 
for  natural resources had an operating loss of million  compared to income of million for this decline was due to the effect of adverse geological conditions and unanticipated equipment repairs in mine no 
 which resulted in days of lost longwall production 
in mine no 
a scheduled longwall move took longer than expected  resulting in days of lost production  and a geologic fault slowed the longwall advance rate in the second half of the year 
additionally  the mine safety and health administration temporarily ordered the closure of mine no 
for approximately two weeks in july  resulting in million of idle mine costs 
the temporary closure resulted in no fines or penalties 
partially offsetting these negatives  the natural gas operation posted increased revenue and operating income  due to higher gas prices 
in december  the company announced that jwr expects to close mine no 
during the fourth quarter of  approximately two years earlier than originally scheduled  due to continuing adverse geologic conditions 
as a result  natural resources expects to incur restructuring charges and additional operating costs associated with the shutdown of approximately million  of which approximately million will qualify as restructuring charges 
costs associated with this closure recorded in included million recorded as restructuring charges  which was primarily for an increase in benefits costs associated with a curtailment of the other postretirement benefits plan million and severance costs million 
estimated costs associated with the restructuring are as follows in thousands total expected costs restructuring charges expensed for the year ended december  termination benefits  other employee related costs   other costs  total   the company s remaining two mines will benefit from the closure by redeploying highly skilled miners and equipment to increase productivity and reduce capital requirements 
during the third quarter of  mine no 
returned to full production following a september accident 
business interruption and property insurance covered the impact on operating results of reduced production and shipments and higher costs during the recovery period 
natural resources recognized million of business interruption claims as reductions of cost of sales in in addition  cost of sales included million for re entry costs that were fully offset by property insurance and casualty claims reflected as reductions to cost of sales 
the company also recorded a million reduction in the allowance for potential uncollectible insurance recoveries as a reduction of cost of sales in additionally  approximately million of expected insurance proceeds were recorded as miscellaneous income in  representing the gain on a reimbursement of fully depreciated equipment  the replacement cost of which was capitalized during the year ended december  the only amounts reflected in was a further million reduction in the allowance for potential uncollectible insurance recoveries recorded as a reduction of cost of sales  based on the final settlement of all insurance recoveries 
as of the end of january  approximately million of insurance proceeds has been collected in full satisfaction of the company s claims under its insurance policies 
performance at natural resources is expected to improve after the first quarter of when the existing panels in mines no 
and with difficult geologic conditions are completed and mining moves to more productive areas 
in addition  as a result of increased demand  particularly from china  as well as reduced supplies  the world s metallurgical coal markets have seen significant increases in prices 
in the first quarter of  jim walter resources completed negotiations for most of its annual metallurgical coal supply contracts  which generally cover the period from july through june these contracts were negotiated with price increases that averaged in excess of from previous contracts 
the combination of better geologic conditions  efficiencies related to the announced closure of mine no 
and increases in metallurgical coal pricing in the second half of the year should have a significant positive impact on natural resources profitability in other net sales and revenues were million for compared to million in the prior year 
sloss revenues were million lower than the prior year  which were partially offset by higher revenues from land sales of million compared to the prior year 
sloss revenues declined during the current period due to lower sales of foundry coke  fiber and specialty chemicals  partially offset by higher furnace coke volumes and favorable furnace coke pricing 
the operating loss for the other segment declined from million in  to million in general corporate expenses included in this segment were approximately million in compared to million in of the million decrease  million relates to credits to expenses of this segment in for charges made to other segments  primarily industrial products  in these expenses were included as costs of this segment in the remaining decrease was due to lower incentive compensation and other personnel related costs million  lower depreciation expenses million and higher life insurance related income million 
corporate expenses also reflected reduced income from land sales million that was offset by increased gains of million from sales of land in the land group 
sloss operating loss increased by million in on weaker slag and specialty chemical results  increases in environmental related expenditures million  and other increased expenses  partially offset by income from asset sales million and the effect of a million bad debt expense in discontinued operations aimcor net sales and revenues were million for  a decrease of million from the prior year 
the decrease reflects approximately one less month of operations  as the sale of aimcor was effective on december   partially offset by higher fuels grade petcoke volumes from the start up of st 
croix operations  higher calcined volumes and an increase in metals volumes and pricing 
income from discontinued operations for aimcor was million in compared to million in the prior year 
this also reflected approximately one less month of operations  costs associated with repairing a furnace at the bridgeport  alabama ferrosilicon production facility  reduced petcoke margins and a decrease in terminal services activity 
the loss in to dispose of aimcor s operations was million  net of million of income tax benefit 
jw aluminum jw aluminum s net sales and revenues were million in  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase reflected strong demand for jw aluminum s foil and sheet products  partially offset by approximately one less month of operations  as the sale of jw aluminum was effective on december  income from discontinued operations for jw aluminum was million  million above the prior year  even though results reflected only approximately months of operations 
these results also reflected increased shipments of aluminum foil and sheet products  as well as improved productivity 
the gain resulting from the sale of jw aluminum was million  net of million of income tax expense

financing revenues increased primarily due to higher prepayment speeds 
the other segment increased on higher volumes and pricing for furnace coke at sloss 
industrial products revenue decreased due to a decrease in shipments of ductile iron pipe during  reflecting the impact the national recession had on demand for these products  combined with lower pricing due to intense pricing competition within the industry
