item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are specialists in the area of service optimization solutions and derive revenues from the licensing of our software products and the provision of consulting and support services 
software license revenues are comprised of perpetual software license fees primarily derived from contracts with our direct sales clients and our indirect distribution channels 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop  as amended 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
service revenues are comprised of revenues from consulting  training  and post contract customer support 
consulting services are billed at an agreed upon rate plus incurred expenses 
clients licensing our products generally purchase consulting agreements from us 
post contract customer support arrangements provide technical support and the right to software updates 
post contract customer support revenues are charged as a percentage of license fees depending upon the level of support coverage requested by the customer 
our support contracts typically renew automatically for successive twelve month periods unless the customer informs us of its desire not to renew annual support 
during the course of  we achieved four profitable quarters by increasing our annual revenues from while reducing our annual expenses by from the previous year 
the key elements of this performance were our ability to increase our presence in the marketplace  particularly in the utilities and telecommunications industries  through direct sales and channel partners and the restructuring plan that we implemented in the fourth quarter of another key factor contributing to our success in was our ability to attract and implement large scale optimization solutions 
as in  we believe that our performance in will primarily depend on our ability to continue attracting and implementing service optimization solutions 
we believe that we can manage the level of our expenses so as to maintain annual profitability if we achieve our revenue targets

we attained profitability in the three months ending march  and maintained profitability in the next three quarters 
our ability to maintain profitability will depend on our ability to increase our revenues while continuing to control our expenses 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain profitability  particularly given the current economic conditions and a potential reduction in information technology spending by our current and prospective customers 
if we are not successful in doing so  we will be required to seek new  external sources of financing  which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares  and the terms of these securities could impose restrictions on our operations

critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  and bad debt provisions 
we base our estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and forecasts  and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues or delay in recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
in addition  the timing of our revenue recognition influences the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
our revenues are principally derived from the licensing of our software and the provision of related services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with sop revenues from software license fees are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  either by written agreement or a purchase order signed by the customer  the software product has been delivered  the license fees are fixed and determinable  and collection of the license fees is considered probable 
license fees from software arrangements which involve multiple elements  such as post contract customer support  consulting and training  are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
we determine the vsoe for each element according to the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in judging the k clicksoftware technologies ltd 
page probability of collection of software license fees we continuously monitor collection and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
in connection with customers with whom we have no previous experience  we may utilize independent resources to evaluate the creditworthiness of those customers 
for some customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  we may grant extended payment terms 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if the financial situation of any of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay the indebtedness they incur with us  additional allowances may be required 
our software products generally do not require significant customization or modification 
however  when such customization or modification is necessary  the revenue generated by those activities is deferred and recognized using the percentage of completion method 
service revenues include post contract customer support  consulting and training 
post contract customer support arrangements provide for technical support and the right to unspecified updates on an if and when available basis 
revenues from those arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  usually one year 
consulting services are recognized on a time and material basis  or in a fixed price contract  on a percentage of completion basis 
revenues from training are recognized as the services are provided 
in recognizing revenues based on the rate of completion method  we estimate time to completion with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future services margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts using estimates that we make based on factors we believe appropriate such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different assumptions  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase our bad debt expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb the primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise the primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either i the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to address certain fin implementation issues

factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this statement before you decide to invest in our ordinary shares 
if any of the negative events referred to below occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in any such case  the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business our need for additional financing is uncertain  as is our ability to obtain further financing if required 
our ability to maintain or increase profitability using our currently available balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term loans will depend on our ability to maintain or increase our revenues while continuing to control our expenses 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so 
if we are not successful in doing so  particularly given the uncertainties regarding future information technology spending by our current and prospective customers  we will need to raise additional capital to finance our operations 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to sell additional equity or debt securities 
if we are able to issue equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares  and the terms of these securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to the stock holdings of our shareholders 
additionally  prior to the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities to entities outside of israel  we will need to obtain approval from the chief scientist and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain this consent in the future 
alternatively  we may seek other forms of financing  such as credit from banks or institutional lenders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition or operating results 
we may not be able to maintain profitability 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing and research and development expenses 
some of our expenses  such as administrative and management payroll and rent and utilities  are fixed in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to decreases in revenues 
as a result  we will need to k clicksoftware technologies ltd 
page generate significant revenues to maintain profitability  which we may not be able to do 
we face risks relating to our financial statements restatement 
following a reaudit of our financial statements conducted in the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  we restated our financial statements for   and the first six months of on january   we filed an amendment to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the restatement of our prior financial statements may lead to litigation claims against us 
the defense of claims may cause the diversion of management s attention and resources  and we may be required to pay damages if any such claims are not resolved in our favor 
any litigation  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses 
in this regard  on august   a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against us  one of our officers and one of our former officers 
none of the defendants have been served  and the case is in the preliminary stages 
the complaint is substantially similar to a complaint previously filed in the same court against these parties and dismissed by the court for failure to perfect service on the defendants in a timely manner 
the complaint is purportedly brought on behalf of investors who purchased our securities between june  and october  and seeks unspecified damages 
the complaint contains various allegations  including violations of the securities exchange act of and common law claims with respect to our financial results for  and the first six months of it is not possible for us to quantify the extent of our potential liability  if any 
an unfavorable outcome in this or any other case could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and the trading price of our ordinary shares 
in addition  we have provided information regarding our financial statement restatement to the staff of the securities and exchange commission on a voluntary basis  and the sec has requested additional information 
any additional inquiry by the sec may result in a diversion of our management s attention and resources and require additional expenses for professional services 
in addition  any claims against us or any inquiry by the sec may cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our share price may decrease 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are not a good measure for comparison 
our operating history shows that a significant percentage of our quarterly revenues comes from orders placed towards the end of a quarter 
from time to time  we are reliant upon a sale of significant size to a single customer 
a delay in the completion of any such sale past the end of a particular quarter could negatively impact results for that quarter  and such negative impact could be significant  even without the delay of a significant sale  our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our ordinary shares may decrease 
the factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include the following o the volume and timing of customer orders  o internal budget constraints and approval processes of our current and prospective clients  o the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle  o the mix of revenue generated by product licenses and professional services  o the mix of revenue between domestic and foreign sources  k clicksoftware technologies ltd 
page o announcements or introductions of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  o changes in prices of and the adoption of different pricing strategies for our products and those of our competitors  o timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses  o changes in our business and partner relationships  o technical difficulties or bugs affecting the operation of our software  o foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and o general economic conditions 
our stock price could be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile 
the price at which our ordinary shares trades is likely to be volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as o announcements of technological innovations  o announcements relating to strategic relationships  o conditions affecting the software industries  o trends related to the fluctuations of stock prices of companies such as ours  o our historical and anticipated quarterly and annual operating results  o variations between our actual results and the expectations of investors or published reports or analyses regarding our business  o announcements by us or others affecting our business  systems or expansion plans  and o general conditions and trends in technology industries 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
the economic outlook may adversely affect the demand for our current products and our results of operations 
predictions regarding general economic conditions remain uncertain 
unless the economic outlook improves significantly  the rate of growth of information technology spending may stagnate 
consequently  the demand for our products may not grow or may decrease  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  it is difficult to predict economic conditions  and further predicting the effects of the changing economy is even more difficult 
we may not accurately gauge the effect of the general economy on our business 
as a result  we may not react to such changing conditions in a timely manner and this may result in an adverse impact on our results of operations 
any such adverse impacts to our results of operations from a changing economy may cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline

page failure of the market to accept our products would adversely affect our profitability 
historically  all of our operating revenue has come from sales of  and services related to  our service optimization suite  which enables efficient provisioning of services in enterprise environments 
our service optimization suite includes clickschedule  clickfix  clickanalyze  clickplan  clickmobile and clickforecast 
we continually improve and enhance our service optimization site to meet market requirements 
our growth depends on the development of market acceptance of these products we have no guarantee that the sales of our products will continue to develop as we anticipate  or at all 
lack of long term demand for our products would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our sales and implementation cycles depend on factors outside our control  which may cause quarterly license and service fees revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
to date  our customers have taken typically from three months to nine months to evaluate our offering before making their purchase decisions 
in addition  depending on the nature and specific needs of a client  the implementation of our products typically takes three to nine months 
sales of licenses and implementation schedules are subject to a number of risks over which we have little or no control  including clients budgetary constraints  clients internal acceptance reviews  the success and continued internal support of clients own development efforts  the efforts of businesses with which we have relationships  the nature  size and specific needs of a client and the possibility of cancellation of projects by clients 
the uncertain outcome of our sales efforts and the length of our sales cycles could result in substantial fluctuations in license revenues 
historically  a significant portion of our sales in any given quarter occur in the last two weeks of the quarter  if sales forecasted from a specific client for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we are unlikely to be able to generate revenues from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  and due to the relatively large size of some orders  a lost or delayed sale could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly revenue and operating results 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than expected  revenue and operating results for subsequent quarters could be adversely affected 
we depend on key personnel  and the loss of any key personnel could affect our ability to compete and our ability to attract additional key personnel may be impaired 
we believe our future success will depend on the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales and marketing  product development and professional services personnel 
dr 
moshe benbassat  our chief executive officer  has individually participated in and has been responsible for overseeing much of the research and development of our core technologies 
the services of dr 
benbassat and other members of our senior management team and key personnel would be very difficult to replace and the loss of any of these employees could harm our business significantly 
we have employment agreements with our executive officers  including dr 
benbassat 
although these agreements generally require sixty to ninety days notification prior to departure  relationships with these officers and key employees are at will 
the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our ability to execute our business strategy and compete 
if we fail to expand our professional services organization  we may not be able to service additional clients 
we cannot be certain that we can attract or retain a sufficient number of highly qualified professional services personnel to meet our business needs 
clients that license our software typically engage our professional services organization to assist with the installation and operation of our software applications 
our professional services organization also provides assistance to our clients related to the maintenance  management and expansion of their software systems 
future growth in licenses of our software will depend in part on our ability to provide our clients with these services 
in addition  we will be required to expand our professional services organization to enable us to continue to support our existing installed base of customers 
if we were not able to maintain our professional services organization  our ability to support our service business would be limited 
k clicksoftware technologies ltd 
page if we fail to expand our relationships with third parties that can provide implementation and professional services to our clients  we may be unable to increase our revenues and our business could be harmed 
in order for us to focus more effectively on our core business of developing and licensing software solutions  we need to continue to establish relationships with third parties that can provide implementation and professional services to our clients 
third party implementation and consulting firms can also be influential in the choice of resource optimization applications by new clients 
if we are unable to establish and maintain effective  long term relationships with implementation and professional services providers  or if these providers do not meet the needs or expectations of our clients  we may be unable to grow our revenues and our business could suffer 
as a result of the limited resources and capacities of many third party implementation providers  we may be unable to attain sufficient focus and resources from the third party providers to meet all of our clients needs  even if we establish relationships with these third parties 
if sufficient resources are unavailable  we will be required to provide these services internally  which could limit our ability to meet other demands 
even if we are successful in developing relationships with third party implementation and professional services providers  we will be subject to significant risk  as we cannot control the level and quality of service provided by third party implementation and professional services partners 
our market is highly competitive and any reduction in demand for  or prices of  our products could negatively impact our revenues  reduce our gross margins and cause our share price to decline 
the market for our products is competitive and rapidly changing 
competition may increase in the future as current competitors expand their product offerings and new companies attempt to enter the market 
because the market for service and delivery optimization software is evolving  it is difficult to determine what portion of the market each competitor currently controls 
however  competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margin and loss of market share  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
we may not be able to compete successfully  and competitive pressures may harm our business 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations  sales  distribution and other resources than us 
in addition  some of our potential competitors are among the largest and most well capitalized software companies in the world 
failure to fully develop or maintain key business relationships could limit our ability to sell additional licenses  thereby decreasing our revenues and increasing our sales and marketing costs 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain business relationships with software vendors  resellers  systems integrators  distribution partners and customers 
if we fail to continue developing these relationships  our growth could be limited 
we have entered into agreements with third parties relating to the integration of our products with their product offerings  distribution  reselling and consulting 
we are currently deriving revenues from these agreements but we may not be able to derive significant revenues in the future from these agreements 
in addition  our growth may be limited if prospective clients do not accept the solutions offered by our strategic partners 
our market may experience rapid technological changes that could cause our products to fail or require us to redesign our products  which would result in increased research and development expenses 
our market is characterized by rapid technological change  dynamic client needs and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technology developments and client requirements  or if our product development or introduction is delayed  we may have lower revenues 
client product requirements can change rapidly as a result of computer hardware and software innovations or changes in and the emergence  evolution and adoption of new industry standards 
for example  we offer windows versions of our products due to the market acceptance of windows over the last several years 
while we interface smoothly with unix systems  we currently do not provide unix versions of our software 
the actual or anticipated introduction of new products has resulted and will continue to result in some reformulation of our product offerings 
technology and industry standards can make existing products obsolete or unmarketable or result in delays in the k clicksoftware technologies ltd 
page purchase of such products 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
we must respond to developments rapidly and continue to make substantial product development investments 
as is customary in the software industry  we have previously experienced delays in introducing new products and features  and we may experience such delays in the future that could impair our revenue and operating results 
our products could be susceptible to errors or defects that could result in lost revenues  liability or delayed or limited market acceptance 
complex software products such as ours often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
in the past  some of our products have contained errors and defects that have delayed implementation or required us to expend additional resources to correct the problems 
despite internal testing  testing by current and potential clients and the history of use by our installed base of customers  our current and future products may contain as yet undetected serious defects or errors 
any such defects or errors could result in lost revenues  liability or a delay in market acceptance of these products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the performance of our products also depends in part upon the accuracy and continued availability of third party data 
we rely on third parties that provide information such as street and address locations and mapping functions that we incorporate into our products 
if these parties do not provide accurate information  or if we are unable to maintain our relationships with them  our reputation and competitive position in our industry could suffer and we could be unable to develop or enhance our products as required 
our intellectual property could be used by third parties without our consent because protection of our intellectual property is limited 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
however  we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  which may significantly harm our business 
specifically  we may not be able to protect our trademarks for our company name and our product names  and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult  particularly in countries outside the us  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights 
our end user licenses are designed to prohibit unauthorized use  copying or disclosure of our software and technology in the united states  israel and other foreign countries 
however  these provisions may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions and foreign countries 
unauthorized third parties may be able to copy some portions of our products  reverse engineer or obtain and use information and technology that we regard as proprietary 
third parties could also independently develop competing technology or design around our technology 
if we are unable to successfully detect infringement and or to enforce our rights to our technology  we may lose competitive position in the market 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the united states  israel or elsewhere will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  some of our licensed users may allow additional unauthorized users to use our software  and if we do not detect such use  we could lose potential license fees 
our technology and other intellectual property may be subject to infringement claims 
substantial litigation regarding technology rights and other intellectual property rights exists in the software industry both in terms of infringement and ownership issues 
a successful claim of patent  copyright or trademark infringement or conflicting ownership rights against us could cause us to make changes in our business or significantly harm our business 
we believe that our products do not infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
however  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in all future intellectual property disputes 
we expect that software products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement or ownership claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment k clicksoftware technologies ltd 
page grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties may make a claim of infringement or conflicting ownership rights against us with respect to our products and technology 
any claims  with or without merit  could o be time consuming to defend  o result in costly litigation  o divert management s attention and resources  or o cause product shipment delays 
further  if an infringement or ownership claim is successfully brought against us  we may have to pay damages or royalties  enter into a licensing agreement  and or stop selling the product or using the technology at issue 
any such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
from time to time  we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
we also indemnify some of our customers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
we have only conducted a partial search for existing patents and other intellectual property registrations  and we cannot assure you that our products do not infringe any issued patents 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states and israel are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which would relate to our products 
our business may become increasingly susceptible to numerous risks associated with international operations 
significant portions of our operations occur outside the united states 
our facilities are located in north america  israel  the european continent  the united kingdom and australia  and our executive officers and other key employees are dispersed throughout the world 
this geographic dispersion requires significant management resources that may place us at a disadvantage compared to our locally based competitors 
in addition  our international operations are generally subject to a number of risks  including o foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  o longer sales cycles  o multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  o expenses associated with customizing products for foreign countries  o protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition  o difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  and o political and economic instability 
we expect international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues and we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales and professional services activities in order to be successful 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to expand our international sales management and professional services organizations  hire additional personnel  customize our products for local markets and establish relationships with additional international distributors  consultants and other third parties 
if we fail to manage our geographically dispersed organization  we may fail to meet or exceed our business plan and our revenues may decline

page we are incorporated in israel and have important facilities and resources located in israel  which could be negatively affected due to military or political tensions 
we are incorporated under the laws of the state of israel and our research and development facilities as well as significant executive offices are located in israel 
although substantial portions of our sales currently are to customers outside of israel  political  economic and military conditions in israel could nevertheless directly affect our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
since september  a continuous armed conflict with hostile elements in the palestinian authority has been taking place 
despite our history of avoiding adverse effects  in the future we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  a significant increase in inflation  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
the current state of peace talks between israel and its arab neighbors is uncertain 
several arab countries still restrict business with israeli companies  which may limit our ability to make sales in those countries 
we could be adversely affected by restrictive laws or policies directed towards israel or israeli businesses 
certain of our officers and employees are required to serve in the israel defense forces and this could force them to be absent from our business for extended periods 
david schapiro  our executive vice president  markets and products  hannan carmeli  our executive vice president  product services and operations  and shmuel arvatz  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  as well as other male employees located in israel  are currently obligated to perform up to days of annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
the loss or extended absence of any of our officers and key personnel due to these requirements could harm our business 
we are an international company and our international operations are expanding 
our risk exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is increasing  and we may not be able to fully mitigate the risk 
our revenue from the uk has grown both in absolute dollar basis as well as a percentage of total revenues 
we are expanding operations in other areas of europe  and income and expenses recognized in the european community euro are increasing

in addition to above  we have balance sheet exposure related to foreign net assets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect ourselves against such risks 
we are incurring additional costs and devoting more management resources to comply with increasing regulation of corporate governance and disclosure 
we are spending an increased amount of management time and external resources to understand and comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules 
devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities 
the government programs in which we currently participate and tax benefits which we currently receive require us to satisfy prescribed conditions and may be delayed  terminated or reduced in the future 
this would increase our costs and taxes 
we receive grants from the government of the state of israel through the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade  or the chief scientist  for the financing of a significant portion of our research and development expenditures in israel  and we may apply for additional grants in the future 
we cannot assure that we will continue to receive grants at the same rate or at all 
the chief scientist budget has been subject to reductions that may affect the k clicksoftware technologies ltd 
page availability of funds for chief scientist grants in the future 
the percentage of our research and development expenditures financed using grants from the chief scientist may decline in the future  and the terms of such grants may become less favorable 
in connection with research and development grants received from the chief scientist  we must make royalty payments to the chief scientist on the revenues derived from the sale of products  technologies and services developed with the grants from the chief scientist 
from time to time  the government of israel changes the rate of royalties we must pay  so we are unable to accurately predict this rate 
in addition  our ability to manufacture products or transfer technology outside israel without the approval of the chief scientist is restricted under law 
any manufacture of products or transfer of technology outside israel will also require us to pay increased royalties to the chief scientist up to 
we currently conduct all of our manufacturing activities in israel and intend to continue doing so in the foreseeable future and therefore do not believe there will be any increase in the amount of royalties we pay to the chief scientist 
currently the office of the chief scientist does not consider the licensing of our software in the ordinary course of business a transfer of technology and we do not intend to transfer any technology outside of israel 
consequently  we do not anticipate having to pay increased royalties to the chief scientist for the foreseeable future 
in connection with our grant applications  we have made representations and covenants to the chief scientist regarding our research and development activities in israel 
the funding from the chief scientist is subject to the accuracy of these representations and covenants 
if we fail to comply with any of these conditions  we could be required to refund payments previously received together with interest and penalties and would likely be denied receipt of these grants thereafter 
we anticipate receiving tax benefits from the government of the state of israel  however these benefits may be delayed  reduced or terminated in the future 
pursuant to the law for the encouragement of capital investments  the government of the state of israel through the investment center has granted approved enterprise status to three of our existing capital investment programs 
consequently  we are eligible for certain tax benefits for the first several years in which we generate taxable income 
we have not  however  begun to generate taxable income for purposes of this law and we do not expect to utilize these tax benefits for the near future 
once we begin to generate taxable income  our financial condition could suffer if our tax benefits were significantly reduced 
the benefits available to an approved enterprise are dependent upon the fulfillment of certain conditions and criteria 
if we fail to comply with these conditions and criteria  the tax benefits that we receive could be partially or fully canceled and we could be forced to refund the amount of the benefits we received  adjusted for inflation and interest 
from time to time  the government of israel has discussed reducing or limiting the benefits 
we cannot assess whether these benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
it may be difficult to enforce a us judgment against us  our officers and directors and the israeli accountants named as experts in this statement or to assert us securities laws claims in israel or serve process on substantially all of our officers and directors and these accountants 
we are incorporated in israel and maintain significant operations in israel 
some of our executive officers and directors and the israeli accountants named as experts in this statement reside outside of the united states and a significant portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
therefore  it may be difficult for an investor  or any other person or entity  to effect service of process on us or any of those persons or to enforce a us court judgment  based upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws  against us or any of those persons  in an israeli court 
additionally  it may be difficult for an investor  or any other person or entity  to enforce civil liabilities under us federal securities laws in original actions instituted in israel 
we have appointed clicksoftware inc  our us subsidiary  as our agent to receive service of process in any action against us arising out of our original june  initial public offering

page a significant portion of our workforce is subject to israeli labor laws  which may lead to claims for additional overtime pay 
israeli law provides that employment arrangements with employees not in senior managerial positions  or whose working conditions and circumstances do not facilitate employer supervision of their hours of work  must provide for compensation which differentiates between compensation paid to employees for a hour work week or for maximum daily work hours and compensation for overtime work 
israeli law also limits the maximum number of hours of overtime 
certain of our employment compensation arrangements are fixed and do not differentiate between compensation for regular hours and overtime work 
therefore  we may face potential claims from these employees asserting that the fixed salaries do not compensate for overtime work 
while there is no certainty that such claims will prevail  even if they do  we do not believe that these claims would have a material adverse effect on us 
our officers  directors and affiliated entities own a large percentage of our ordinary shares and could significantly influence the outcome of actions 
as of december   our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding ordinary shares 
these shareholders  if acting together  would be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
these actions may be taken even if our other investors oppose them 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of us  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of israeli corporate and tax law and of our articles of association may have the effect of delaying  preventing or making more difficult any merger or acquisition of us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  any merger or acquisition of us will require the prior consent of the chief scientist 
israeli law regulates mergers  votes required to approve a merger  acquisition of shares through tender offers and transactions involving significant shareholders 
in addition  our articles of association provide for a staggered board of directors and for restrictions on business combinations with interested us 
accordingly  an acquisition of us could be delayed or prevented even if it would be beneficial to our shareholders 
other ordinary shares may be sold in the future 
this could depress the market price for our ordinary shares 
as of december   we had  ordinary shares outstanding net of  shares held in treasury  including shares held by a trustee for issuance under outstanding options 
in addition  as of december   we had  ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options  and  additional ordinary shares reserved for issuance pursuant to our stock option plans and employee share purchase plan 
if we or our existing shareholders sell a large number of our ordinary shares  the price of our ordinary shares could fall dramatically 
restrictions under the securities laws limit the number of ordinary shares available for sale by our shareholders in the public market 
we have filed a registration statement on form s to register for resale the ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our stock option plans

passive income includes dividends  interest  royalties  rents annuities and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets  which produce passive income 
for purposes of the asset test  cash is considered to be an asset that produces passive income 
as a result of our cash position and the decline in the value of our assets  there is a substantial risk that we are a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
if we are characterized as a pfic  our shareholders who are residents of the united states will be subject to adverse united states tax consequences 
our k clicksoftware technologies ltd 
page treatment as a pfic could result in a reduction in the after tax return to shareholders resident in the united states and may cause a reduction in the value of such shares 
if we were to be treated as a pfic  our shareholders will be required  in certain circumstances  to pay an interest charge together with tax calculated at maximum rates on certain excess distributions including any gain on the sale of ordinary shares 
in order to avoid this tax consequence  they may be permitted to make a qualified electing fund election however we do not currently intend to take the action necessary for our shareholders to make a qualified electing fund election  in which case  in lieu of such treatment they would be required to include in their taxable income certain undistributed amounts of our income or may elect to mark to market the ordinary shares and recognize ordinary income or possible ordinary loss each year with respect to such investment and on the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares 
prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences applicable to them of investing in our ordinary shares
