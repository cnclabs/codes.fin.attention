item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview human genome sciences is a mid stage development company with a significant product pipeline derived from proprietary genomic technology 
our goal is to build a global biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets gene based protein and antibody drugs to treat and cure disease 
the success of our drug discovery efforts derives from our expertise in genomics  the systematic collection and understanding of human genes and their functions 
we focus our internal product development efforts on novel human protein and antibody drugs discovered through genomics based research  and on new long acting versions of existing protein drugs created using our albumin fusion technology 
we use collaborations for the development of other protein and antibody drugs  gene therapy products  small molecule drugs  and diagnostic products discovered using our genomics based technology 
we have products in clinical development and additional products in clinical trials by companies with which we are collaborating 
we continue to evaluate new drugs for advancement into clinical development 
we have established strategic partnerships with a number of leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage our strengths and to gain access to complementary technologies and sales and marketing infrastructure 
some of these partnerships provide us with research funding and milestone payments  along with royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
we also are entitled to certain co promotion  co development  revenue sharing and other product rights 
we have not received any significant product sales revenue or royalties from product sales and any significant revenue from product sales or from royalties on product sales in the next several years is uncertain 
to date  all of our revenue relates to payments made under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline and  to a lesser extent  other agreements 
the initial research term associated with the glaxosmithkline collaboration agreement and many of our other collaboration agreements expired in and those agreements will only generate additional milestone and royalty payments if our collaborators successfully develop drugs based on our technology 
we may not receive any of these payments and may not be able to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
we expect that any significant revenue or income for at least the next several years may be limited to investment income  payments under various collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  payments from the sale of product rights and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein  antibody and fusion protein product candidates 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and significant losses over the next several years unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or new collaboration agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
such judgments are often the result of a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
see note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued we currently believe the following accounting policies to be critical we carry our cash  cash equivalents  investments  other assets  accounts payable and certain other accrued liabilities at their respective fair values 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors and is subjective in nature 
if management determines that such an impairment exists we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
if we held investments that were classified as held to maturity securities  these would be carried at amortized cost rather than at fair market value 
if we held investments that were classified as trading securities  these would be carried at fair market value  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings for any change in fair market value 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
two of our operating leases are commonly referred to as synthetic leases 
a synthetic lease is a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds of the costs for the acquisition and or construction of the property and leases the asset to the lessee 
under these leases  we provide a residual value guarantee which guarantees the lessor that the residual value of the leased assets will be at least equal to a specified amount at lease termination 
we have determined that the entities that own the properties have sufficient substance such that they can be treated as unrelated entities to us and  accordingly  do not require consolidation into our financial statements 
further  we have determined that the terms of the property leases qualify them as operating leases under generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  these synthetic leases are treated as operating leases for accounting purposes 
changes in the equity participation of the third parties or our obligations under the agreements could affect the classification of these leases from operating to capital 
in that event  we would include both the cost and debt associated with the properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
in june  we restructured these two leases to comply with the new requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
we recognize revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we have a continuing obligation to provide access to our technology ratably over the period of obligation in accordance with the guidance provided in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we recognize deferred revenues related to these obligations on a straight line basis over the life of the obligation 
our revenues with transgene are being recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the ten year term of the agreement or prorated upon the selection of genes by transgene 
our other revenues in have been earned and recognized in full as we have no continuing obligation 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based on the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the applicable agreement 
research and development expenses primarily include related salaries  outside services  materials and supplies  and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
our drug development expenses include accruals for clinical site and clinical research organization cro costs 
we make estimates of the costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to clinical site costs and cro costs 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs  when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions 
we have stock option plans under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the fair market value on the date of grant 
we critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under apb no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price of the option and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the option 
because our options must be granted at fair market value  we recognize no compensation expense at the time of the grant in accordance with apb no 
if we were to adopt the fair value based method set forth in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 we would recognize compensation expense based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under the plans using the fair value method 
we do not report the compensation expense using the fair value method shown in note b of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have provided pro forma disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements of our net loss and net loss per share as if we used the fair value method 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenues consisted of the recognition of an aggregate of million in revenue received from pfizer  inc pfizer  genentech  inc 
genentech and from medimmune  inc medimmune  million recognized from our collaboration with transgene  sa transgene and a million milestone payment from glaxosmithkline gsk 
the revenues consisted of the recognition of million from our collaboration with transgene and million in a milestone payment from gsk 
expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   including a million charge for construction design changes to the large scale manufacturing facility in excluding the million charge  research and development expenses increased slightly to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  drug development  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to reduced activity in gene discovery and in the study of preclinical therapeutic protein drug candidates  including a decrease of million in services and expense recognition of license fees to dyax corporation and a decrease of million in collaboration payments to cambridge antibody technology 
our drug development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to increased process development activity  where we are evaluating ways to develop or improve our product candidates and production processes 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increased production and quality assurance activities within our process development and manufacturing facilities needed to support our increased clinical activities 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued our clinical development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the cost of continuing ongoing trials from as well as initiating new trials in the charge for construction design changes of million for the year ended december  related to our decision to modify the initial design of the large scale manufacturing facility mentioned above 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to a million decrease in legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered  mostly offset by a million increase in facility and other costs relating primarily to the move of many of our laboratories and offices to a new facility 
investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to lower average cash and short term investment balances and reduced yield due to declining interest rates 
investment income also includes realized gains and losses on our short term and restricted investments of million and million for and  respectively  along with a realized gain of approximately million relating to sale of approximately of our equity investment in ciphergen biosystems  inc ciphergen during the third quarter of see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the yield on our investments was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  our average cash balance decreased during as a result of our net loss and capital expenditures in we believe investment income will continue to be lower than the prior year as our short term investments mature and are reinvested at rates lower than previously obtained 
interest expense decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to interest capitalized in of million relating primarily to the construction of our large scale manufacturing facility 
assuming the cost of the manufacturing facility reaches approximately million when construction is complete in  capitalized interest could approximate million 
total interest expense  before capitalized interest  was million for the year ended december  the charge for impaired investment of million for the year ended december  related to the reduction made to the carrying value in our equity investment in cambridge antibody technology cat 
during the third quarter of  we reduced the carrying value of this investment to million from million due to the significant reduction in market value of cat s shares that we believed may not be temporary 
see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the decreased loss for compared to reflects the absence of both a charge for construction design and a charge for impaired investment and an increase in revenue  partially offset by a decrease in net investment income 
excluding the charge for construction design changes of million and the charge for impaired investment of million incurred in  our net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  would have compared to a pro forma net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  with the increased loss due primarily to reduced net investment income partially offset by increased revenue 
these pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we refer to these non gaap financial measures in making operational decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results 
results of operations continued years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenues consisted of the recognition of million from our collaboration with transgene and million in a milestone payment from glaxosmithkline 
the revenues consisted of the recognition of million in license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo  and merck kgaa  substantially all of which was due to the implementation of sab  retroactive to january   the recognition of million from our collaboration with transgene and million in a milestone payment from glaxosmithkline 
expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   including the million charge for construction design changes in excluding the million charge  research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  drug development  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to increased costs in antibody development related to collaboration payments made to cat along with the expense recognition of the remaining prepaid license fees to dyax corporation 
our drug development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to increased toxicology activity  where we are conducting studies to support our investigational new drug filings that were made or will be made in the future 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increased production activities within our process development and manufacturing facilities needed to support our increased clinical activities 
our clinical development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the cost of continuing ongoing trials from along with the cost of filing  initiating and sustaining new trials that began in the charge for construction design changes of million for the year ended december  relates to our decision to modify the initial design of the large scale manufacturing facility 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our development activities 
the increase also resulted from increased legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered  along with increased recruiting and relocation expenses 
investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to lower average cash and short term investment balances and reduced yield due to declining interest rates 
investment income also includes realized gains and losses on our short term and restricted investments of million and million for and  respectively 
see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the yield on our investments was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  our average cash balance decreased during as a result of our net loss and capital expenditures in interest expense decreased for the year ended december  in comparison to the results of operations continued years ended december  and continued year ended december   due primarily to a reduction in the average debt balance as a result of the conversion to equity of million of convertible notes during the charge for impaired investment of million for the year ended december  relates to the reduction made to the carrying value in our equity investment in cat 
during the third quarter of  we reduced the carrying value of this investment to million from million due to the significant reduction in market value of cat s shares that we believe may not be temporary 
the charge for impaired investment of million for the year ended december  relates to the reduction made to the carrying value in our equity investment in transgene 
we reduced the carrying value of this investment to million from million due to an impairment that we deemed to be other than temporary 
see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
debt conversion expenses of million for the year ended december  relate primarily to the conversion of million aggregate principal of convertible subordinated notes due into equity 
see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the increased loss for compared to reflects charges for increased impairment of investments and construction design changes  increased manufacturing operations  increased investment in the discovery and development of our drug candidates  reduced net investment income  increased general and administrative activities and reduced revenue 
excluding the charge for construction design changes incurred in  the charges for impaired investments incurred in and  and the charge for debt conversion expenses for  our pro forma net loss would have been million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  these pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap 
we refer to these non gaap financial measures in making operational decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december  as compared to billion at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to our net loss  along with a net increase in our restricted investments and capital expenditures during our capital expenditures for included approximately million for the construction of a large scale manufacturing facility that we anticipate completing by at a total cost of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which may increase relative to historical levels as we focus on development and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein  antibody and fusion protein product candidates 
the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we are proceeding with numerous clinical trials 
we have several phase and phase trials underway and expect to initiate additional trials in the future 
completion of these trials may extend several years or more  but the length of time generally varies considerably according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
we estimate that the completion periods for our phase  phase and phase trials could span one year  one to two years and two to four years  respectively 
the duration and cost of our clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
liquidity and capital resources continued we identify our potential drug candidates by conducting numerous preclinical studies 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each drug candidate 
based upon the results from our trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain indications or certain drugs in order to concentrate our resources on more promising drug candidates 
we are advancing many drug candidates  including therapeutic proteins  antibodies and albumin fusion proteins  in part to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
in addition  our manufacturing plants have been designed to enable multi product manufacturing capability 
accordingly  we believe our future financial commitments  including those for preclinical  clinical or manufacturing activities  are not substantially dependent on any single drug candidate 
should we be unable to sustain a multi product drug pipeline  our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates would increase 
we must receive fda clearance to advance each of our products into and through each phase of clinical testing 
moreover  we must receive fda regulatory approval to launch any of our products commercially 
in order to receive such approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all fda requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs or that our drugs and the manufacturing facilities will meet all fda requirements 
in addition  part of our business plan includes collaborating with others 
for example  gsk is developing products discovered by gsk as part of our collaboration with them 
we have no control over the progress of gsk s development plans 
while we have received an aggregate of million from gsk in connection with development milestones met by gsk during and  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the likelihood of receiving future milestone or royalty payments 
we also cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current or future collaborations will affect our drug development efforts and therefore  our capital and liquidity requirements 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds and investment income will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next several years 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs including our discovery and development activities  the magnitude of those programs  the ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements  the cost involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
depending upon market and interest rate conditions  we are exploring  and  from time to time  may take actions to strengthen further our financial position 
in this regard  in the second quarter of  we restructured certain of our outstanding lease obligations and may further modify our lease financings and repurchase or restructure some or all of our outstanding convertible debt instruments in the future depending upon market and other conditions 
we have certain contractual obligations  including some that are not recorded on our balance sheets  which will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
see off balance sheet arrangements below for additional discussion 
our operating leases  including those with residual value guarantees  along with our unconditional purchase obligations are not recorded on our balance sheets 
liquidity and capital resources continued these contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows payments due by period dollars in millions one year two to four to after total or less three years five years five years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases rental obligations for facility leases with residual value guarantees unconditional purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheets total contractual cash obligations certain of our current or future lease payments are based upon currently applicable interest rates 
see additional discussion of these facility leases below 
certain of our operating leases contain residual value guarantees relating to two facility leases described below 
our unconditional purchase obligations relate primarily to commitments for capital expenditures  consisting primarily of manufacturing space build out and equipment 
the amounts exclude anticipated  but not yet obligated costs  estimated at approximately million associated with our construction of a large scale manufacturing facility 
because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current collaborations will require us to make future milestone or royalty payments  we have excluded these amounts from the above table 
for additional discussion of our debt obligations and lease commitments  see notes h and i of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire  if unused  by the year we also have available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carry forwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  by the year our unrestricted and restricted funds may be invested in us treasury securities  government agency obligations  high grade corporate debt securities and various money market instruments rated a or better 
such investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with an emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into lease agreements for a research and development and administrative facility and another research facility the traville lease and the mcd lease  respectively that have been structured such that they are accounted for as operating leases 
this structure provides us with cost effective financing and future financing flexibility 
none of our directors  officers or employees has any financial interest with regard to these lease arrangements 
the traville lease has a term of approximately seven years beginning in and relates to a research and development and administrative facility located on the traville site in rockville  maryland 
the total financed cost of the traville lease facility is million 
construction of the traville facility was off balance sheet arrangements continued substantially completed during our rent obligation approximates the lessor s debt service costs plus a return on the lessor s equity investment 
the rent under this lease is currently based on the rate for short term commercial paper  but the lessor can lock in a fixed interest rate at any time at our request 
to the extent the lessor does not lock in a fixed interest rate  if interest rates increase  our rent obligations would also increase 
if interest rates decrease  our rent obligations would decrease 
the current floating rate was approximately as of december  the mcd lease has a term of seven years beginning in and relates to a million research facility located at medical center drive  near our traville facility in rockville  maryland 
the rent under this lease is fixed 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate was approximately 
our restricted investments with respect to the traville lease  the mcd lease and other leases for the existing process development and manufacturing facility are expected to reach approximately million 
these restricted investments will serve as collateral for the duration of the leases 
we will be required to restrict investments equal to of the full amount of the million financed project cost for the traville lease  or million  upon the payment of the remaining construction period obligations  and of the full amount of the approximately million financed project cost for the mcd lease as collateral for the duration of the leases 
in addition  we are also required to maintain up to a maximum of million in restricted investments with respect to the process development and manufacturing facility leases 
our restricted investments for all of these leases aggregated million as of december  compared to million as of december  as of december   restricted investments also included approximately million that related to the construction of our large scale manufacturing facility 
as a result of the lease restructurings in june  we no longer maintain any restricted investments with respect to this facility 
in connection with the traville lease  we must maintain minimum levels of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and certain debt ratios 
in connection with the mcd lease  we must maintain minimum levels of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  as well as comply with certain dividend restrictions 
under the traville and mcd leases  we have the option to purchase the properties during and at the end of the lease terms at an aggregate amount of approximately million 
alternatively  we can cause the properties to be sold to third parties 
we are contingently liable for the residual value guarantee associated with each property in the event the net sale proceeds are less than the original financed costs of the facilities 
we are contingently liable for the residual value guarantee associated with the traville lease and the mcd lease of approximately million and million  respectively 
see note i of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
we have entered into various equipment leases with rental payments aggregating million over the lease term which range from five to seven years 
we must either purchase the equipment at the end of the initial term at the greater of fair market value or of original cost or  in some cases  extend the term of the lease for an additional year 
we have accounted for these leases as operating leases 
minimum annual rentals are approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations of a material nature that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio may be comprised of low risk us treasuries  government agency obligations  high grade debt having at least an a rating and various money market instruments 
the short term nature of these securities  which currently have an average term of approximately months  significantly decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and short term and restricted investments by approximately million  or approximately of the aggregate fair value of billion  at december  for these reasons  and because these securities are generally held to maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt securities held as of december  we believe that any market change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  the general decline in interest rates will adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and are replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
as of december   the yield on comparable two year investments was approximately  as compared to our current portfolio yield of approximately 
as of december   the market values of our equity investments in transgene  cat  corautus genetics inc corautus and ciphergen were approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
our investments in transgene  corautus and ciphergen are subject to equity market risk 
our investment in cat is denominated in pounds sterling and is subject to both foreign currency risk as well as equity market risk 
the facility leases we entered into during and require us to maintain minimum levels of restricted investments as collateral for these facilities 
by  our maximum restricted investments for these leases could be approximately million 
together with the requirement to maintain up to approximately million in restricted investments with respect to our process development and manufacturing facility leases  our overall level of restricted investments could reach million 
although the market value for these investments may rise or fall as a result of changes in interest rates  we will be required to maintain this level of restricted investments in both a rising or declining interest rate environment 
the rent under the traville lease is based on a floating interest rate 
we can direct the lessor to lock in a fixed interest rate 
as of december   such a fixed rate for seven years would be approximately compared to the floating rate as of december  of approximately 
if interest rates increase  our rent obligations would also increase  which would result in an increase in our operating expenses 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s convertible subordinated notes because they bear interest at fixed rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued during  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences europe gmbh hgs europe  that will manage our clinical trials and clinical research collaborations in european countries 
although hgs europe s activities are denominated primarily in euros  we believe the foreign currency fluctuation risks for to be immaterial to our operations as a whole
