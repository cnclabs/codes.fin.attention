item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  including statements about our beliefs and expectations 
there are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those stated below under the headings cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risk factors as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing  and we assume no obligation to update such statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
overview costar is the leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states and the united kingdom based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available  have the largest research department and the most clients in the industry  provide more information services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors 
we have created a standardized information platform where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information 
our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease  comparable sales information  tenant information  information about properties for sale  information for clients web sites  information about industry professionals and their business relationships  analytic information  data integration  property marketing  organizational tools for contact and property information and industry news 
we completed our initial public offering in july  and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we used those net proceeds to fund the geographic and service expansion of our business  including three strategic acquisitions  and to expand our sales and marketing organization 
in may  we completed a follow on public offering and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we used a portion of those net proceeds to fund the acquisitions of comps 
com  inc comps and property intelligence plc property intelligence 
in november  we completed an additional follow on public offering and issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we expect to use the remainder of the proceeds from these public offerings for development and distribution of new services  expansion of existing services across our current markets  geographic expansion in the us and international markets  strategic acquisitions  working capital and general corporate purposes 
from through the beginning of  we expanded the geographical coverage of our existing information services and developed new information services 
in addition to internal growth  this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource  inc in chicago in and new market systems  inc in san francisco in in august we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houston based real estate information provider c data services  inc in january we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend  inc and into atlanta and dallas fort worth by acquiring jamison research  inc in september we acquired ares development group  llc  a los angeles based developer and distributor of ares for act 
in february we acquired comps  a san diego based provider of commercial real estate information 
in november we acquired first image technologies  inc first image 
in september we expanded further into portland  oregon through the acquisition of certain of the assets of napier realty advisors d b a real net real net 
in january we established a base in the united kingdom with our acquisition of london based property intelligence 
the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section 
since our inception  the growth of our business has required substantial investments for the expansion of our services and the establishment of operating regions throughout the united states  which resulted in substantial net losses on an overall basis until throughout and  we experienced a rapid expansion in the number of services that we offer and the number of regions in which we operate 
by the beginning of  we had substantially established a national platform of service offerings in us metropolitan markets from which we believe we can appropriately meet the commercial real estate community s needs for comprehensive us building specific information 
from through  we focused on continuing to grow revenue while controlling and reducing costs  in order to reduce operating losses and become profitable in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
during  our gaap net income increased from a net loss of million for the year ended december  to net income of  for the year ended december  in addition  we increased ebitda net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization by million from million in to million in our use of non gaap financial measures is discussed later in this section 
beginning in  we plan to further expand into new metropolitan markets throughout the united states as well as expand the geographical boundaries of many of our existing us markets 
the field research phase of this expansion is expected to start in the second quarter of we generally have not experienced this type of internal geographic expansion since although we believe that a large component of our current operating cost structure is made up of fixed operating costs  our planned expansion will cause our cost structure to escalate in advance of revenues in these new metropolitan markets  as we invest in future revenue growth opportunities for and beyond 
in addition  the incremental costs of introducing new services in an existing market or increasing geographic coverage in an existing market may further increase our operating cost structure and reduce the profitability of an existing market prior to release of the additional service offerings or increasing market coverage 
we expect revenue to grow significantly over revenue as a result of expected further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our platform  as well as the successful cross selling of our services into our existing customer base 
in addition  we expect ebitda to significantly increase over ebitda and gaap net income to significantly increase over gaap net income  each as a result of expected increased revenue growth coupled with a relatively fixed operating cost structure 
if we achieve our expected revenue growth and maintain a relatively fixed operating cost structure  we believe we will maintain positive cash flow from operating activities throughout historically  our calculations of weighted average outstanding shares for basic and diluted net loss per share have been identical because stock options that would have had an anti dilutive effect on the calculation have been properly excluded from the calculation 
we achieved gaap basis net income for the year ended december   and as a result our calculation of weighted average outstanding shares for diluted net income per share includes the effect of any dilutive stock options  which are any outstanding stock options that have an exercise price lower than the average market price of our common stock for the year ended december  we expect that our diluted net income per share will be lower than our basic net income per share for any future periods in which we report gaap basis net income due to the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options 
in addition  our calculation of weighted average outstanding shares for basic and diluted net income per share for included the effect of the weighted average outstanding shares related to our november follow on public offering in which we issued approximately million shares of our common stock 
as a result of this share issuance  we expect our calculation of weighted average outstanding shares for basic and diluted net income per share for to significantly increase compared to our calculation of weighted average outstanding shares for basic and diluted net income per share for in addition  we achieved taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of  which enabled us to utilize some of our net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
although our net operating loss carryforwards are substantial  we are subject to limitations on their use 
in addition  we are subject to federal alternative minimum taxes and state and local tax jurisdictions may not recognize portions of these loss carryforwards 
as a result  we incurred income tax expense for the year ended december  and expect to incur income tax expense in the future 
we continue to develop and distribute new services  expand existing services across our us and us markets and expand the geographic boundaries of our current markets 
the incremental cost of introducing new services  expanding existing services  or expanding geographic boundaries in the future may reduce the profitability of a region or cause it to incur losses 
in addition to our planned geographic expansion into new metropolitan markets throughout the united states  we may continue further geographic expansion in the united states or we may seek additional international geographic expansion 
any future significant geographic expansion could also significantly increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings in existing regions to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business  it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
while our services continue to expand  our subscription based information services  consisting primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional and focus services  currently generate over of our total revenues 
our contracts for our subscription based information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
prior to  our contract renewal rate historically had exceeded on an annual basis 
for the year ended december   our renewal rate decreased to as a result of the downturn in general economic conditions 
subsequent to  our contract renewal rate has been increasing and for the year ended december   our contract renewal rate was 
we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives beginning in the first quarter of in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the effect of the new rules decreased amortization expense related to goodwill by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the previous year 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we measure any impairment loss to the extent that the asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not reasonably assured  we must establish a valuation allowance 
going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have determined that we will be able to begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  resulting in a benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
accounting for employee stock options as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb no 
 we recognize compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded as determined at the measurement date 
we disclose the required pro forma information in our notes to consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
had been applied 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
these non gaap financial measures include ebitda  which is our net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and pro forma earnings  which is our net income loss before purchase amortization in cost of revenues  purchase amortization in operating expenses and the related income tax benefit 
we disclose ebitda in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we disclose pro forma earnings in our earnings releases and investor conference calls 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose other non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view ebitda and pro forma earnings as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to them is net income loss 
in calculating ebitda and pro forma earnings  we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda and pro forma earnings are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as measures of liquidity  as alternatives to net income loss or as indicators of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda and pro forma earnings as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda and pro forma earnings 
ebitda and pro forma earnings are used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complimentary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information services  which included acquisitions  our net income loss includes significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
ebitda and pro forma earnings  which exclude these charges  provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
we believe the disclosure of ebitda and pro forma earnings helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe ebitda and pro forma earnings are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others regularly rely on ebitda and pro forma earnings to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
finally  management and the board of directors use pro forma earnings as one of several criteria to determine the achievement of performance based cash bonuses 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and pro forma earnings and the material limitations associated with using these non gaap financial measures as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired tradenames 
we do not believe these charges reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of net interest income and income taxes we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  management does not consider the amount of net interest income or income taxes representative of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by only using non gaap measures to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

revenues grew from million in to million in this growth was the result of additional revenue from the property intelligence acquisition and further penetration of our subscription based information services into our existing and potential customer base  as well as the successful cross selling of information services into our existing customer base across our service platform

gross margin 
gross margin increased from million in to million in gross margin percentage also increased from in to in the increase in the gross margin percentage resulted principally from internal revenue growth from our subscription based information services  which was slightly offset by the addition of margins from our uk markets averaging approximately

selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to the addition of approximately million of selling and marketing expenses from our uk markets as a result of the property intelligence acquisition  increased sales and marketing personnel costs and marketing campaigns surrounding the release of our web based costar property professional service 
software development expenses 
software development expenses increased from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in this increase was due to the addition of uk software development expenses as a result of the property intelligence acquisition and our continued focus on service enhancements and development as well as the support of internal information systems to manage the company s growth 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase in the amount of general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the addition of million for uk general and administrative expenses as a result of the property intelligence acquisition  which was offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses from our us markets primarily due to reductions in administrative headcount 
purchase amortization 
purchase amortization increased from million in to million in this increase was due to increased purchase price amortization of identified intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of property intelligence  and was partially offset by a decrease in purchase amortization resulting from the complete amortization of certain identified intangible assets during other income  net 
interest and other income decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily a result of lower total cash balances for the first three quarters of  and lower interest rates during the year 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased from in to  in this increase is a result of the fact that we achieved taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of  which caused us to incur income tax expense 
our total income tax expense was partially offset through the use of some of our net operating loss carryforwards 
because we are subject to federal alternative minimum taxes and because certain state and local tax jurisdictions do not currently recognize portions of our net loss carryforwards  we were not able to completely offset our income tax liability through the use of our net operating loss carryforwards 
comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues 
revenues grew from million in to million in this growth was principally the result of further penetration of our services in our potential customer base across our national platform  as well as the successful cross selling of services into our existing customer base 
subscription based information services  including costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional  costar exchange and costar connect  accounted for over of the company s revenues 
gross margin 
gross margin increased from million in to million in gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in the increase in gross margin amount and percentage resulted from revenue growth combined with a reduction in cost of revenues 
this reduction was principally due to a million decrease in purchase price amortization resulting from the complete amortization of certain identified intangibles assets during the first quarter of this was somewhat offset by an increase in research personnel costs compared to the same period in selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in during  we significantly increased the size of our sales force for subscription based information services 
although this growth occurred  selling and marketing expenses decreased during principally as a result of a reduction in overall operating costs associated with the sales organization  including travel and other personnel costs 
software development expenses 
software development expenses increased from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase in software development expenses reflects development costs for the increased number of services we now support 
in addition  these costs reflect the support of internal information systems to manage the company s growth 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the decrease in the amount of general and administrative expenses is primarily due to reductions in administrative headcount  communications  consulting  travel costs and outside services during purchase amortization

 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets

the effect of the new rules decreased amortization expense related to goodwill by approximately million for as compared to other income  net 
interest and other income decreased from million in to  in this decrease was primarily a result of lower total cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and lower interest rates during the year

goodwill will not be amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
we are in the process of obtaining additional information regarding the income tax attributes and deferred taxes related to property intelligence to complete the purchase price allocation 
property intelligence  whose operations principally consist of focus services  is a leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the united kingdom 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  in addition  we had million of cash held for acquisition as of december   which was used for the acquisition of property intelligence  which closed on january  from december  to december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million  principally as a result of our november follow on public offering in which we issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million  net cash provided by operating activities of million  and proceeds of million from stock option exercises used to purchase approximately  shares of common stock  offset by cash purchases of property and equipment of approximately million and the net outlay of cash for the property intelligence acquisition 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of revenue growth and resulting growth in gross margin  which contributed to reaching  of gaap net income in compared to a gaap net loss of million in additionally  improved account collections resulted in a reduction of approximately million in accounts receivable  contributing to operating cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash used in investing activities was principally due to the increase in purchases of short term investments from the proceeds of our november follow on public offering and the net cash paid for the acquisition of property intelligence 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was principally the result of our november follow on public offering in which we issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million as well as proceeds of million from stock option exercises to purchase approximately  shares of common stock

capital expenditures for are expected to include investments in assets required to support our planned market expansion  including additional field research vehicles  building photography  initial databases  and communications  measuring  photographic and computer equipment  totaling approximately million 
additionally  approximately million to million is planned to support existing operations  consistent with expenditures for the past several years 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we expect to use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we achieved taxable income in the third and fourth quarters of  which enabled us to utilize some of our net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
although our net operating loss carryforwards are substantial  we are subject to limitations on their use 
in addition  we are subject to federal alternative minimum taxes and state and local tax jurisdictions that currently do not recognize portions of these loss carryforwards 
as a result  we incurred income tax expense of approximately  during we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas regardless of the accounting method used to account for stock based compensation 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas and sfas we believe that generally accepted accounting principles in the united states related to stock based employee compensation may continue to change  with such changes including requiring companies to record stock based compensation expense using the fair value method for the options granted to employees 
changes in these rules requiring us to record expense related to grants of stock options using the fair value method may reduce our gaap net income results 
additionally  we are evaluating our compensation practices and may develop alternative stock based employee compensation plans  including without limitation the issuance of restricted stock  which may result in recording additional expense to our consolidated statement of operations and reduce our gaap net income

risk factors we have experienced operating losses and our future profitability is uncertain 
until the third quarter of  we had not recorded an overall operating profit because the investment required for geographic expansion and new information services has caused our expenses to exceed our revenues 
our ability to continue to earn a profit will largely depend on our ability to manage our growth  including our expansion plans  and to generate revenues that exceed our expenses 
in addition  our ability to continue to earn a profit  to increase revenues or to control costs could be affected by the factors set forth below 
we may not be able to generate revenues or control expenses sufficient to earn a profit  to increase profits on a quarterly or annual basis  or to sustain or increase our future revenue growth and  as a result  the market price of our common stock may decline 
a downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may decrease customer demand for our services 
the commercial real estate industry has begun to stabilize in recent months  as evidenced by improving  leasing activity  rental rates and absorption rates 
however  a reversal of this trend or renewed downturn in the commercial real estate market may continue to affect our ability to generate revenues and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers  both of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability 
a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base  which could decrease demand for our information services 
also  companies in this industry are consolidating  often in order to reduce expenses 
consolidation may lead to more cancellations of our information services by our customers  reduce the number of our existing clients  reduce the size of our target market or increase our clients bargaining power  all of which could cause our revenues or our revenue growth rate to decline and reduce our profitability 
we may not be able to complete successfully our planned geographic expansion  which may negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
expanding into new markets imposes additional burdens on our research  systems development  sales  marketing and general managerial resources 
in  we expect to expand into new us markets and expand geographic coverage in certain of our existing markets 
if we are unable to manage this expansion plan  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we incur significant costs to expand into these new markets  or are not successful in marketing and selling our services in these markets  then it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition by increasing our expenses without increasing our revenues 
if we are unable to complete successfully our planned geographic expansion or if we are unable to manage this expansion successfully  it may adversely affect our profitability 
we may not be able to successfully introduce new or upgraded information services  which could decrease our revenues and our profitability 
our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new and upgraded services into the marketplace 
to be successful  we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our information services 
developing new services and upgrades to services imposes heavy burdens on our systems department  management and researchers 
this process is costly  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services 
in addition  successfully launching and selling a new service puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources 
if we are unable to develop new or upgraded services  then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our revenues may decline and our profitability may be reduced 
in addition  if we incur significant costs in developing new or upgraded services  are not successful in marketing and selling these new services or upgrades  or our customers fail to accept these new services  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by decreasing our revenues or our revenue growth rate and by reducing our profitability 
general economic conditions could increase our expenses and reduce our revenues 
our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy 
the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global  national  regional and local economic conditions  including inflation  interest rates  perceived and actual economic conditions  taxation policies  availability of credit  employment levels  and wage and salary levels 
the recent negative state of the economy  and the commercial real estate industry in particular  has had a negative impact on our business 
negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business by reducing our revenues and profitability 
additionally  any war in which the united states is involved or any significant terrorist attack is likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price 
in addition  a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses  which may not be offset by increased revenues 
if clients choose to cancel our information services as a result of economic conditions  and we do not acquire new clients  our revenues may decline and our financial position would be adversely affected 
if we are not able to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions  our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have expanded our markets and services in part through acquisitions of complementary businesses  services  databases and technologies  and expect to continue to do so in the future 
our strategy to acquire complementary companies or assets depends on our ability to identify  and the availability of  suitable acquisition candidates 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including managing the integration of personnel and products  managing geographically remote operations  such as property intelligence in the united kingdom  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the inherent risks in entering markets and sectors in which we have either limited or no direct experience  and the potential loss of key employees or clients of the acquired companies 
we may not successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets and may not achieve anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  one time write offs of goodwill and substantial amortization expenses of other intangible assets 
our stock price may be negatively affected by fluctuations in our operating results 
our operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons  many of which are outside of our control  such as cancellations or non renewals of our services  competition  our ability to control expenses  loss of clients or revenues  changes or consolidation in the real estate industry  the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements  successful execution of our expansion plan  the development of our sales force  managerial execution  data quality  employee retention  foreign currency fluctuations  our investments in geographic expansion  successful adoption of and training on the company s services  the timing of investing the net proceeds from our offerings  acquisitions of other companies or assets  sales  brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities  client training and support activities  changes in client budgets  or our investments in other corporate resources 
in addition  changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our level of gaap net income  including without limitation  changes requiring us to expense stock options 
fluctuations in our operating results  revenues and expenses may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our revenues and financial condition will be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain clients 
our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our information services 
our subscription based information services generate the largest portion of our revenues 
however  we may be unable to attract new clients in planned expansion markets and our clients existing markets may decide not to add  not to renew or to cancel subscription services as a result of several factors  including without limitation a decision that they have no need for our services  a decision to use alternative services  pricing and budgetary constraints  consolidation in the real estate industry  data quality  technical problems  or economic or competitive pressures 
if clients decide not to renew or cancel their agreements  and we do not attract new clients  then our revenues or our revenue growth rate may decline 
if our operating costs are higher than we expect  our profitability may be reduced 
many of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs  are relatively fixed 
as a result  we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in expenses 
additionally  we may experience higher than expected operating costs  including increased personnel costs  selling and marketing costs  investments in geographic expansion  acquisition costs  occupancy costs  communications costs  travel costs  software development costs  outside services costs and other costs 
if operating costs exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  our profitability may be reduced and our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
competition could render our services uncompetitive 
the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing 
our existing competitors  or future competitors  may have greater name recognition  larger customer bases  better technology or data  lower prices  easier access to data  greater user traffic or greater financial  technical or marketing resources than we have 
our competitors may be able to undertake more effective marketing campaigns  obtain more data  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  make more attractive offers to potential employees  subscribers  distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements 
increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses  which would reduce our profitability 
international expansion may result in new business risks which may reduce our profitability 
our international expansion could subject us to new business risks  including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries  difficulties in managing foreign operations  limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  costs of enforcing contractual obligations  impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel  systems development  research and sales departments  and general managerial resources 
if we are not able to manage our growth successfully  we may incur higher expenses and our profitability may be reduced 
finally  the investment required for international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion  which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the property intelligence acquisition  a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and as a result  fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
currencies may be affected by internal factors  and external developments in other countries  all of which can have an adverse impact on a country s currency 
currently  we do not have any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
we may seek to enter into hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully  on acceptable terms or at all 
we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future  and significant foreign exchange fluctuations resulting in a decline in the british pound may decrease the value of our foreign assets  as well as decrease our revenues and earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate  comprehensive or reliable data  we could experience reduced demand for our information services 
our success depends on our clients confidence in the comprehensiveness  accuracy and reliability of the data we provide 
the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging 
if our data  including the data we obtain from third parties  is not current  accurate  comprehensive or reliable  we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers  which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 
if we are unable to hire  retain and continue to develop our sales force  our revenues could be adversely affected 
in order to support revenue growth  we need to continue to develop  train and retain our sales force 
our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors  including our ability to integrate and motivate sales personnel  our ability to effectively train our sales force  the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of services  the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive  the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel  and our ability to effectively manage a multi location sales organization 
if we are unable to hire  develop or retain the members of our sales force  or if our sales force is unproductive  our revenues could decline or cease to grow and our expenses could increase 
temporary or permanent outages of our computers  software or telecommunications equipment could lead to reduced demand for our information services 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our database  computers and software  telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire  power loss  security breaches  computer viruses and telecommunications failures 
any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident  equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business 
if we experience a failure that prevents us from delivering our information services to clients  we could experience reduced demand for our information services 
technical problems that affect our customers use of or access to our services could lead to reduced demand for our information services 
our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our web site  the internet and our service providers 
problems with our web site  the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers access to our information services 
if we experience technical problems in distributing our services  we could experience reduced demand for our information services 
in addition  the software underlying our services is complex and may contain undetected errors 
despite testing  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in our software 
any errors could result in adverse publicity  impaired use of our services  loss of revenues  cost increases and legal claims by customers 
all these factors could seriously damage our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel 
our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel  including our president and chief executive officer  andrew florance  our officers and other key employees 
our business requires highly skilled technical  sales  management  web development  marketing and research personnel  who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers 
to retain and attract key personnel  we use various measures  including employment agreements  a stock incentive plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers 
these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr 
florance or other key officers or employees 
litigation in which we become involved or newly adopted laws and regulations may significantly increase our expenses 
currently and from time to time  we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient insurance to cover our pending claims or our future claims 
any lawsuits in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money 
if any claims are determined against us  our profitability could be reduced and our financial position could be adversely affected 
in addition  governments in the united states or abroad could adopt laws that could harm our business by for example  regulating the information we provide or regulating our transmissions over the internet  or exposing our business to taxes in various jurisdictions 
compliance with any such laws could increase our costs or make our services less attractive 
if we are unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property  our business  competitive position and operating results could be harmed 
the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies  database  services and software 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and other laws  nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions  license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data 
in addition  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving  and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property 
the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons intellectual property rights 
any intellectual property lawsuits in which we are involved  either as a plaintiff or as a defendant  could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management s attention from operating our business 
in addition  if we do not prevail on any intellectual property claims  this could result in a change to our methodology or information services and could reduce our profitability 
we may be subject to legal liability for displaying or distributing information 
because the content in our database is distributed to others  we may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories 
we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites or information on our web site supplied by third parties 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims 
our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require us to expend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our information services to users 
market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past  and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future 
the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  changes in analysts estimates of our earnings  announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services  general conditions in the commercial real estate industry  developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights  regulatory developments  and economic or other factors 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general  and the shares of internet related and other technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december  we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
although as of december  we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired  we would recognize an impairment charge for the excess amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets 
on january   we acquired the share capital of london based property intelligence 
property intelligence is a leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the united kingdom 
our functional currency for our operations in the united kingdom is the local currency 
as such  fluctuations in the british pound may have an impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully or at all
