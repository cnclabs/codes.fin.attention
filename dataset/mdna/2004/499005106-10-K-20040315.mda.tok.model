table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview effective in the fourth quarter of  the company instituted a new segment reporting format to include three reportable business segments equity markets  derivative markets  and asset management 
prior to this change  the company reported two business segments equity markets  which included equity and derivatives business activities  and asset management 
this segment reporting change was made to better reflect management s approach to operating and directing the businesses and to more closely align financial and managerial reporting 
prior period segment data has been restated to conform to the presentation 
equity markets we are a leading execution specialist providing comprehensive trade execution services to institutional and broker dealer clients  offering capital commitment and access to a deep pool of liquidity across the depth and breadth of the us equity markets 
derivative markets we are a leading us listed options market maker and specialist  providing comprehensive trade execution services to institutions and broker dealers across a significant number of us option products 
asset management we operate an asset management business for institutions and high net worth individuals  managing billion of assets as of the end of the company s investment in the deephaven funds  which was million at december   and related investment returns  are included within this segment 
the following table sets forth the revenues  expenses excluding international charges and writedown of assets and lease loss accrual operating expenses and income loss before international charges  writedown of assets and lease loss accrual  income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations pre tax operating earnings of our segments and on a consolidated basis in millions equity markets revenues operating expenses pre tax operating earnings derivative markets revenues operating expenses pre tax operating earnings asset management revenues operating expenses pre tax operating earnings consolidated revenues operating expenses pre tax operating earnings 
table of contents our diluted earnings per share were for  up from a loss of per share in total revenues in increased from  while operating expenses increased 
our pre tax operating earnings increased to million in  up from a loss of million in the improvement in our financial results were primarily a result of the strong turnaround in our equity markets business  driven by the improvement in market conditions  the growth of our institutional business and cost cutting in the us  and the closure of our unprofitable international market making businesses in europe and japan 
pre tax operating earnings from our asset management business increased by over in due to greater fund returns  the growth in our assets under management and the increase in our investment in the deephaven funds 
derivative markets results also improved due to higher contract volumes and cost cutting 
a reconciliation of pre tax operating earnings to gaap income before income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations pre tax gaap income is included elsewhere in this section 
market and economic conditions in during the first few months of  investors continued to be concerned with weak corporate earnings and increased uncertainty about the strength and pace of the domestic economic recovery coupled with increased geopolitical unrest 
however  us market and economic conditions improved significantly as the year progressed 
as a result  us financial markets rebounded and experienced increased volumes as investors began to re enter the financial markets 
during  the nasdaq composite index was up from december  similarly  the djia and the s p were up and  respectively  from december  certain factors affecting results of operations we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in operating results due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  introductions or enhancements to market making services by us or our competitors  the value of our securities positions and our ability to manage the risks attendant thereto  the volume of our market making activities  the dollar value of securities traded  volatility in the securities markets  our market share with institutional clients  the performance of our international operations  our ability to manage personnel  overhead and other expenses  including our occupancy expenses under our office leases and legal fees related to our legal proceedings  the strength of our client relationships  the amount of  and volatility in  the results of our quantitative market making and program trading portfolios  changes in payments for order flow and clearing costs  the addition or loss of executive management and sales  trading and technology professionals  legislative  legal and regulatory changes  legal and regulatory matters  geopolitical risk  the amount and timing of capital expenditures and divestitures  the incurrence of costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions  investor sentiment  the level of assets under management  technological changes and events  seasonality  competition and market and economic conditions 
such factors may also have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives  including  without limitation  increases in our market share and revenue capture in our equity and derivative markets segments and increases in our fund returns and assets under management in our asset management segment 
if demand for our services declines in any of our business segments due to any of the above factors  and we are unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis  our operating results and strategic objectives could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the current rate of revenue growth or return to the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past or that we will be able to improve our operating results 

table of contents trends we believe that our business is currently impacted by the following trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
over the past three years  the effects of decimalization and other market structure changes  competition and market conditions have resulted in a decline in revenue capture per us equity dollar value traded in our equity markets operations and revenue capture per contract in our derivative markets operations 
retail investor participation in the equity and options markets increased in from the prior two years  particularly in low priced otc bulletin board issues 
this growth in retail transaction volumes may not be sustainable 
decimalization  market structure changes  competition and market conditions have triggered an industry shift from market makers trading otc securities solely as principal to executing trades on a riskless principal or agency basis with institutions paying commission equivalents or commissions  respectively 
currently  we execute the majority of our institutional client orders on a riskless principal or agency basis  charging commission equivalents or commissions  respectively  and we execute the majority of our broker dealer client orders as principal 
in addition  institutional commission rates have fallen in the past few years  and this may continue in market makers have reduced their payment for order flow rates as average revenue capture per us equity dollar value traded and average revenue capture per contract have fallen 
as a result  we have changed our payment for order flow rates several times over the past three years 
in addition  we also have expanded our program of charging execution fees to certain of our broker dealer clients for certain order flow 
the introduction of supermontage by nasdaq and the increase in trading of nasdaq listed securities on other exchanges has increased market fragmentation in the equity markets segment  resulting in increased execution expenses  fragmented liquidity pools and different market centers using different sets of regulatory rules and regulations 
the derivative markets segment is also experiencing changes in market structure 
due to regulatory scrutiny over the past two years relating to equity research and the continued focus by investors on execution quality and overall transaction costs  more institutional commissions are being allocated to broker dealers based on the quality of executions 
in the past  institutional equity commissions were primarily allocated to broker dealers in exchange for either research or soft dollar and commission recapture programs 
this change is also resulting in pressure on commissions 
executions in the equity markets and derivatives markets segments are becoming increasingly automated 
increased automation results in improved efficiency and lower transaction costs  although it may lower the barriers to entry 
there has been increased scrutiny of hedge funds and soft dollar practices by the regulatory and legislative authorities 
new legislation or modifications to existing regulations and rules could occur in the future 
there has been a growing trend among fund management companies and institutions to allocate more of their assets to hedge fund investments 
this has influenced the growth in the hedge fund industry and may provide for greater competition in the future 

table of contents income statement items the following section briefly describes the key components of  and drivers to  our significant revenues and expenses 
revenues our revenues consist principally of net trading revenue from us securities trading and market making activities from both equity and derivative markets 
net trading revenue  which consists of trading gains net of trading losses and commission equivalents  is primarily affected by changes in the amount and mix of us equity trade and share volumes and us option contract volumes  our revenue capture  dollar value of equities traded  our ability to derive trading gains by taking proprietary positions  changes in our execution standards  volatility in the marketplace  our mix of broker dealer and institutional clients and by regulatory changes and evolving industry customs and practices

we execute the majority of our broker dealer client orders as principal 
we also receive fees for providing certain information to market data providers and for directing trades to certain destinations for execution 
commissions and fees are primarily affected by changes in our trade and share volumes in listed securities  changes in commission rates as well as by changes in fees earned for directing trades to certain destinations for execution 
asset management fees represent fees earned by deephaven capital management llc deephaven for sponsoring and managing the deephaven investment funds the deephaven funds 
asset management fees are primarily affected by the rates of return earned on the deephaven funds and changes in the amount of assets under management

the company s clearing agreements call for payment or receipt of interest income  net of transaction related interest charged by clearing brokers for facilitating the settlement and financing of securities transactions 
net interest is primarily affected by interest rates  the changes in cash balances held at banks and clearing brokers and our level of securities positions in which we are long compared to our securities positions in which we are short

employee compensation and benefits expense fluctuates  for the most part  based on changes in net trading revenue  asset management fees  our profitability and our number of employees 
payments for order flow fluctuate based on us equity share and option volume  our profitability  the mix of market orders and limit orders  the mix of orders received from broker dealers and institutions who accept payments for order flow and changes in our payment for order flow policy

payments for order flow represent payments to certain clients  in the normal course of business  for directing their order flow in us equities and us option contracts to us and payments to institutions in connection with our commission recapture programs 
payments for order flow fluctuate as we modify our payment rates and as our percentage of clients whose policy is not to accept payments for order flow varies 
due to lower revenue capture and lower overall profitability  we reduced our payment for order flow rates several times over the past three years 
international charges consists of charges from continuing operations related to the reduction of european businesses as well as charges related to the writedown of certain international strategic investments to fair value 
the writedown of assets and lease loss accrual related to our domestic businesses consists of costs associated with impairment charges on intangible assets  excess real estate  fixed assets that are no longer actively used  the writedown of certain domestic strategic investments and exchange seats to fair value

however  the rate of inflation may affect the company s expenses  such as employee compensation  office leasing costs and communications expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of the services offered by the company 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment 
lease loss accrual it is the company s policy to identify excess real estate capacity and where applicable  accrue against such future costs 
in determining the accrual  a nominal cash flow analysis is performed for lease losses initiated prior to december   the effective date of sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which requires the accrual of future costs to be made using a discounted cash flow analysis for lease losses initiated after such date  and costs related to the excess capacity are accrued 
the effect of applying these new provisions to our current lease losses accounted for under a nominal cash flow analysis would not be material 
during  we incurred million of lease loss expense that is included on the consolidated statements of operations in the writedown of assets and lease loss accrual line item 
the majority of this amount is related to our lease at washington boulevard in jersey city  new jersey  of approximately  square feet  all of which is currently unoccupied 
the company engaged a real estate broker in order to sub lease approximately  square feet based on an assessment of our real estate needs 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases  the company recorded a lease loss accrual of million in related to this sub lease 
the accrual at december  was derived from assumptions and estimates based on lease terms of the anticipated sub lease agreement  which assumed a sub lease would have commenced in the middle of  anticipated market prices along the jersey city waterfront and estimated up front costs  including broker fees and build out allowances 
we continually monitor the market and space to assess the reasonableness of our applicable assumptions 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets the useful lives of goodwill and intangible assets are determined upon acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized over their respective lives 
goodwill and the useful lives of intangible assets are tested for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis 
our goodwill of million is related to the purchase of our listed equities market maker  kcm  our order routing business of kep and the business of donaldson 
during our annual tests for impairment done in  it was determined that these assets were not impaired 
as part of our test for impairment  we considered the profitability of the applicable reporting unit  an assessment of fair value of the reporting unit based on various valuation methodologies  as well as the overall market value of the company  compared to the company s book value 
we determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
our intangible assets balance of million is attributable to both our equity markets business segment and our derivative markets business segment 
included in our equity markets business segment is million related to our acquisition of the business of donaldson 
these assets are being amortized over their useful lives  which have been determined to range from five to thirty years 
included in our derivative markets business segment is million related to our trading rights and trading posts on various options exchanges 
during our annual tests for impairment done in  it was determined that the intangible assets were permanently impaired 
consequently  the intangible assets relating to our trading rights and trading posts on various options exchanges were written down to fair value  resulting in a million impairment charge 
the carrying value of the residual intangible assets continues to be amortized over their remaining useful lives  the majority of which are within one year  with the remainder of up to fourteen years 

table of contents strategic investments investments include ownership interests of less than in financial services related businesses  which are accounted for under the equity method or at fair value 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability corporations 
the fair value of other investments  for which a quoted market or dealer price is not available for the size of our investment  is based on management s estimate 
among the factors considered by management in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment  terms and liquidity  developments since the acquisition of the investment  the sales price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuations in the near term 
the valuations of strategic investments  which include our investment in nasdaq and the ise  are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
in accordance with this policy  in the first quarter of  the company wrote down its investment in nasdaq by million 
market making activities securities owned and securities sold  not yet purchased  which primarily consist of listed and otc stocks and listed options contracts  are carried at market value and are recorded on a trade date basis 
market value is estimated daily using market quotations available from major securities exchanges and dealers 
asset management fees the company earns asset management fees for sponsoring and managing the deephaven funds 
such fees are recorded monthly as earned and are calculated as a percentage of the deephaven funds monthly net assets  plus a percentage of a new high net asset value the incentive allocation fee  as defined  for any six month period ended june th or december st 
a new high net asset value is defined as the amount by which the net asset value of the deephaven funds exceeds the greater of either the highest previous net asset value in the deephaven funds  or the net asset value at the time each investor made his purchase 
if the deephaven funds recognize a loss in the second half of a calendar year  the incentive allocation fee is recalculated on an annual rather than a semi annual basis 
writedown of fixed assets writedowns of fixed assets are recognized when it is determined that the fixed assets are no longer actively used and are determined to be impaired 
the amount of the impairment is determined by the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the fixed asset 
in determining the impairment  an estimated fair value is obtained through research and inquiry of the market 
fixed assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market making and trading activities expose our capital to significant risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to  absolute and relative price movements  price volatility and changes in liquidity  over which we have virtually no control 
for working capital purposes  we invest in money market funds  commercial paper  government securities or maintain interest bearing balances in our trading accounts with clearing brokers  which are classified as cash and cash equivalents and receivable from brokers and dealers  respectively  in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
these other amounts do not have maturity dates or present a material market risk  as the balances are short term in nature and subject to daily repricing 
our cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies are subject to the exposure of foreign currency fluctuations 
these balances are monitored daily  and are not material to the company s overall cash position 
equity markets we employ automated proprietary trading and position management systems that provide real time  on line position management and inventory control 
we monitor our risks by reviewing trading positions and their appropriate risk measures 
we have established a system whereby transactions are monitored by senior management on a real time basis as are individual and aggregate dollar and inventory position totals and real time profits and losses 
the management of trading positions is enhanced by review of mark to market valuations and position summaries on a daily basis 
in the normal course of our equities market making business  we maintain inventories of exchange listed and otc equity securities 
the fair value of these securities at december  and was million and million  respectively  in long positions and million and million  respectively  in short positions 
the potential change in fair value  using a hypothetical decline in prices  is estimated to be a million loss and a million loss as of december  and  respectively  due to the offset of losses in long positions with gains in short positions 
the following table illustrates  for the period indicated  our average  highest and lowest month end inventory at market value based on both the aggregate and the net of the long and short positions of trading securities from our otc and listed market making business 
aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions average month end highest month end lowest month end derivative markets we maintain inventories of options  futures and equities 
our main exposure is from equity price and volatility risk 
we manage these exposures by constantly monitoring and diversifying our exposures and position sizes and establishing offsetting hedges 
our market making staff and trading room managers continuously manage our positions and our risk exposures 
our systems incorporate trades and update our risk profile using options pricing models on a real time basis 

table of contents our proprietary options risk management system allows us to stress test our portfolio on a real time basis 
on a daily basis  risk reports are distributed to senior management and the firm s risk managers who incorporate this information in our market making decisions 
these reports identify potential exposures with respect to options and futures on individual securities and index contracts  organized in different ways such as industry sectors  under extreme price and volatility movements 
at december   movements in volatility and stock prices on our entire equity options and equity index options portfolios  which contain the majority of our market risk  would have resulted in approximately the following gains losses in our options market making portfolio change in stock prices none change in volatility million million million none million million million million million this stress analysis covers positions in options and futures  underlying securities and related hedges 
the changes in stock prices and volatility in the charts above make the assumption of a universal movement in all of our underlying positions 
the analysis also includes a number of estimates that we believe to be reasonable  however  we cannot assure that they will produce an accurate measure of future risk 
asset management as of december   we had million invested in the deephaven funds  which are managed by deephaven 
the general objective of market neutral strategies is to capture mispricings or spreads between related capital instruments 
within the market neutral fund  deephaven employs a variety of market neutral investment strategies  including convertible arbitrage  event risk arbitrage  relative value equity  distressed debt and private placements in public companies 
because the basis of the deephaven funds strategy is capturing mispricings or spreads between related instruments  rather than attempting to predict or follow absolute price movements  the performance of the deephaven funds is expected to be substantially non correlated with the general debt and equity markets  as well as with a number of other non traditional investment strategies 
however  there will be unhedged credit risk in the convertible arbitrage portfolio and that part of the portfolio will have some correlation to credit spreads 
market neutral trading involves substantial risks 
disruptions in historical pricing relationships can result in significant losses 
the deephaven funds also utilize leverage  to the extent available and deemed by deephaven to be consistent with the funds risk reward objectives  in an attempt to increase returns while maintaining strict risk controls 
similar to our equity and derivative markets segments  the deephaven funds employ automated proprietary trading and position management systems that provide position management and inventory control 
we monitor our risks by reviewing trading positions and their appropriate risk measures 
we have established a system whereby transactions are monitored by senior management and a risk control function  as are individual and aggregate dollar and inventory position totals and profits and losses by strategy 
there can be no assurances that the deephaven funds strategy will be successful in achieving either its risk control or its profit objectives
