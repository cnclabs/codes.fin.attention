item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a development stage biopharmaceutical corporation that was formed in we specialize in the discovery  development and commercialization of prescription pain management products 
we have a number of small molecule product candidates that are in various stages of development ranging from preclinical studies to phase iii clinical trials 
our lead product candidate  entereg alvimopan  is designed to selectively block the unwanted effects of opioid analgesics on the gastrointestinal tract 
our other product candidates are being designed as analgesics to treat moderate to severe pain conditions 
we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of entereg  and our potential to achieve revenues from product sales and generate positive cash flows in the foreseeable future is dependent upon successfully commercializing entereg 
we have completed four phase iii clinical studies of entereg for the management of postoperative ileus  and our target is to file a new drug application for entereg late in the first half of results from these clinical studies have not yet been reviewed by the fda in an application for approval 
fda approval is contingent on many factors  including review and approval of our application with respect to the manufacture of our products 
even if entereg is approved by the fda  we will not be successful unless entereg gains market acceptance 
we do not expect to generate positive cash flows from operations for at least the next several years  if at all 
entereg is being evaluated in acute and chronic indications 
our entereg poi phase iii program included four studies which have been completed 
three of these studies poi cl  poi cl and poi cl were double blind  placebo controlled multi center studies each designed to enroll patients scheduled to undergo certain types of major abdominal surgery and receiving opiods for pain relief 
under the protocols  patients were randomized into three arms to receive placebo  mg or mg doses of entereg 
the primary endpoint in these three efficacy studies was time to recovery of gi function  a composite measure of the time to recovery of both upper and lower gi function  as defined by time to tolerability of solid foods and time to first flatus or first bowel movement  whichever occurred last 
the fourth poi clinical study in our phase iii program  poi cl  was a double blind  placebo controlled multi center observational study under which patients were randomized to receive either entereg mg patients or placebo patients 
the four phase iii clinical trials enrolled over  patients in total 
we are targeting submitting an nda for entereg late in the first half of the fda has designated entereg as a fast track product for the management of poi 
the fast track programs of the fda are designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
in april  we announced top line results of our first poi phase iii clinical study  poi cl study poi cl enrolled patients and was designed to include large bowel resection patients and radical hysterectomy patients  as well as simple hysterectomy patients of enrolled patients 
a statistically significant difference was achieved in the primary endpoint of the study  time to recovery of gi function  in patients in the entereg mg treatment group compared to patients in the placebo group cox proportional hazard model  hazard ratio  p 
a difference in favor of the entereg mg treatment group versus placebo was observed for all secondary endpoints  including time to hospital discharge order written 
a positive trend was observed in the primary endpoint of the study for the entereg mg treatment group  however  the difference from placebo was not statistically significant cox proportional hazard model  hazard ratio  p 
the most frequently observed adverse events of both the placebo and treatment groups were nausea  vomiting and abdominal dystension 
the hazard ratio measures the degree of difference between the study drug group and the placebo group 
a hazard ratio of would indicate no difference between the study drug group and the placebo group in achieving the endpoint 
a hazard ratio of means that  on the average during the course of the data collection period  the subjects receiving test drug are more likely to achieve the endpoint 
statistical analyses estimate the probability that a positive effect is actually produced by the drug 
this probability is expressed as a p value which refers to the likelihood that the difference measured between the drug group and the placebo group 
table of contents occurred just by chance 
for example  when a p value is reported as p  the probability that the drug produced an effect by chance is less than 
in september  we announced top line results of our second poi phase iii clinical study  poi cl study poi cl enrolled patients and was designed to include large bowel resection patients  small bowel resection patients and radical hysterectomy patients  and exclude simple hysterectomy patients 
a statistically significant difference was achieved in the primary endpoint of the study  time to recovery of gastrointestinal function  in both the entereg mg and mg treatment groups compared to the placebo group cox proportional hazard model  for mg group  hazard ratio  p  for mg group  hazard ratio  p 
a difference in favor of entereg was observed for all of the secondary endpoints in both the mg and mg treatment groups  including time to hospital discharge order written 
the most frequently observed adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups were nausea  vomiting and hypotension 
in october  we announced top line results of our third poi phase iii clinical study  poi cl  which enrolled patients 
this study was designed to assess safety as its primary endpoint  and to assess efficacy as a secondary endpoint and to only enroll patients scheduled to undergo simple hysterectomy procedures 
study poi cl was the first study where dosing continued on an out patient basis after patients were discharged from the hospital 
entereg was generally well tolerated in this observational safety study with of patients completing treatment in the entereg mg treatment group and of patients completing treatment in the placebo group 
the most frequently observed adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups were nausea  vomiting and constipation 
in january  we announced top line results of our fourth poi phase iii clinical study  poi cl study poi cl enrolled patients  and was designed to include large bowel resection patients  small bowel resection patients and radical hysterectomy patients  as well as simple hysterectomy patients of enrolled patients 
a positive trend was observed in the primary endpoint of the study when each of the entereg mg and mg treatment groups were compared to the placebo group cox proportional hazard model  for mg group  hazard ratio  p  for mg group  hazard ratio  p 
due to the multiple dose comparison to a single placebo group a p value of less than would be required in the mg dose group to be considered statistically significant 
a difference in favor of entereg was observed for all of the secondary endpoints in both the mg and mg treatment groups 
the most frequently observed adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups were nausea  vomiting and pruritis 
the results of studies poi cl  poi cl  poi cl and poi cl have not been submitted in an application for regulatory approval  or reviewed in such an application  by the fda or any other regulatory agency 
in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with glaxo for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of entereg for certain indications 
the companies have agreed to co develop entereg for a number of indications  both acute and chronic  which would potentially involve the use of entereg in in patient and out patient settings 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  glaxo paid us a non refundable and non creditable signing fee of million during the quarter ended june  and we may receive milestone payments of up to million over the term of the agreement upon the successful achievement  if any  of certain clinical and regulatory objectives 
we have also completed several clinical trials studying the use of entereg for the reversal of the severe constipating effects associated with chronic use of opioids 
overall responsibility for the development of entereg in chronic indications is now carried on by glaxo 
glaxo is also conducting early stage studies evaluating entereg in chronic constipation 
we believe there are opportunities to expand our product portfolio by the acquisition or in licensing of products and or product development candidates  and intend to explore and evaluate such opportunities 
in july  we entered into an agreement with epicept  under which we obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize in north america a sterile lidocaine patch which is being developed for the 
table of contents management of postoperative incisional pain 
we made a million payment to epicept upon execution of the agreement and may make up to million in additional development milestone payments if certain clinical and regulatory achievements are reached 
we also have other compounds that are being designed to elicit potential analgesic effects by targeting peripheral and central opioid receptors  including the delta  kappa and mu receptors 
additionally  we are exploring the development of an analgesic product candidate that would be a combination of entereg and an opioid that would be intended to produce the pain relief of an opioid while reducing side effects  such as constipation  nausea and vomiting 
we have a small manufacturing organization to manage our relationships with third parties for the manufacture and supply of products for preclinical  clinical and commercial purposes 
we are currently negotiating commercial supply agreements with certain of these third party manufacturers 
we presently do not maintain our own manufacturing facilities 
we have a small marketing organization to support our development efforts 
we plan to build a sales force in the united states and expand our marketing organization to co promote entereg along with glaxo in hospital care settings  if regulatory approval is received 
we intend to rely on glaxo for sales and marketing of entereg outside the united states 
as we develop additional product candidates we may enter into strategic marketing or co promotion agreements with  and grant additional licenses to  pharmaceutical companies to gain access to additional markets both domestically and internationally 
we have not generated any product sales revenues and have not achieved profitable operations 
our deficit accumulated during the development stage through december  aggregated approximately million  and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods 
a significant portion of our revenue recognized in and was from reimbursement of expenses from glaxo under our collaboration agreement and we expect such revenues to decrease in future periods as we expect the related reimbursable expenses to decrease 
we are highly dependent on the success of our research  development and licensing efforts and  ultimately  upon regulatory approval and market acceptance of our proposed future products 
we may never become profitable and even if we become profitable  we may not be able to sustain profitability on a continuing basis 
we reported an operating cash outflow of million for the year ended december  and we do not expect to generate a positive cash flow from operations for the next several years  if ever 
prior to exhausting our current cash and short term investments  we will need to raise additional funds to finance our operating activities 
there are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing for the long term development and commercialization of our product candidates 
collaboration agreement with glaxo in april  we entered into a collaboration agreement with glaxo for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of entereg for certain indications 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  glaxo paid us a non refundable and non creditable signing fee of million during the quarter ended june  the million signing fee is reflected in deferred licensing fees and is expected to be recognized on a straight line basis through april  the estimated performance period under the collaboration agreement 
we recognized revenue of  and  respectively  in the years ended december  and related thereto 
we may receive milestone payments of up to million over the term of the agreement upon the successful achievement  if any  of certain clinical and regulatory objectives 
the milestone payments relate to substantive achievements in the development lifecycle and it is anticipated that these will be recognized as revenue if and when the milestones are achieved 
we and glaxo have agreed to develop entereg for a number of acute and chronic indications which would potentially involve the use of entereg in in patient and out patient settings 
in the united states  we and glaxo intend to co develop and intend to co promote entereg and share development expenses and commercial returns  if any  pursuant to contractually agreed percentages 
we have overall responsibility for development 
table of contents activities for acute care indications such as poi  and glaxo has overall responsibility for development activities for chronic care indications such as obd 
outside the united states  glaxo will be responsible for the development and commercialization of entereg for all indications  and we will receive royalties on sales revenues  if any 
glaxo has certain rights to terminate the collaboration agreement 
glaxo also has the right to terminate its rights and obligations with respect to the acute care indications  or its rights and obligations for the chronic care indications 
glaxo has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement for breach of the agreement by us or for safety related reasons as defined in the collaboration agreement 
glaxo s rights to terminate the acute care indications or the chronic care indications are generally triggered by failure to achieve certain milestones within certain timeframes  adverse product developments or adverse regulatory events 
if glaxo terminates the collaboration agreement  we may not be able to find a new collaborator to replace glaxo  and our business will be adversely affected 
external expenses for research and development and marketing activities incurred by each company in the united states are reimbursed by the other party pursuant to contractually agreed percentages 
contract reimbursement amounts owed to us by glaxo are recorded gross on our consolidated statements of operations as contract reimbursement revenue 
amounts reimbursable to glaxo by us are recorded as research and development or marketing expense  as appropriate  on our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded contract reimbursement revenue of  and  respectively  in the years ended december  and under the glaxo arrangement 
these revenues represent reimbursement of expenses incurred by us primarily in our poi development program 
additionally  we incurred research and development and marketing expenses of  and  respectively  in the years ended december  and  representing reimbursement by us to glaxo of expenses incurred by glaxo primarily in the obd development program 
we expect contract reimbursement revenues to continue to decline in future periods because we expect the costs of the poi development program to decrease 
we also expect that we will incur increasing expenses in future periods in connection with the obd development program  including payments to glaxo to reimburse them for our proportionate share of expenses they incur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt critical accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the principal items in our consolidated financial statements reflecting critical accounting policies or requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows stock compensation we apply accounting principal board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  and related interpretations  in accounting for stock options granted to employees 
under apb  compensation cost related to stock options is computed based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at the date of grant  reflected by the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of our common stock 
since our november public offering we have generally granted options to employees with exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant  and for such option grants we do not record compensation expense 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  compensation cost related to stock options granted to employees and non employees is computed based on the value of the stock options at the date of grant using an option valuation methodology  typically the black scholes model 
sfas no 
can be applied either by recording the black scholes model value of the options as compensation expense or by continuing to record the apb value and by disclosing sfas no 
compensation costs on a pro forma basis 
had we adopted the black scholes model value provisions of sfas no 
 our loss in   and would have been increased by approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fasb 
table of contents statement no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amended the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the disclosure requirements of statement no 
 which were effective for financial statements issued after december   have been incorporated herein 
collaborative agreement revenues we record deferred revenue for amounts received upfront under collaboration agreements in which we have continuing involvement  and we recognize such deferred amounts as revenue ratably over the estimated contract performance period 
such revenue recognition may be accelerated in the event of contract termination prior to completion of the expected performance period 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement with glaxo we received a non refundable and non creditable upfront fee of million and  in  approximately million of the million up front fee was recognized as revenue 
we expect to recognize approximately million per year as revenue through  the estimated contract performance period 
milestone fees are recorded as revenue when the milestone event is achieved 
amounts reimbursable for costs incurred pursuant to the terms of collaboration agreements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the reimbursable costs are incurred 
such revenues are based on estimates of the reimbursable amount and are subject to verification by the collaborators 
the million of accounts receivable from glaxo at december  is related to estimated reimbursable expenses for the fourth quarter of  and is subject to verification by glaxo 
research and development expenses we have entered into contracts with third parties to conduct certain research and development activities including pre clinical  clinical and manufacturing development activities 
we accrue expenses related to such contracts based upon an estimate of the amounts due for work completed under the contracts 
factors considered in preparing such estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies  materials produced by our manufacturers and other criteria relating to the progress of efforts by our vendors 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced negative operating annual cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of our equity securities  as well as contract revenues 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million at december   and approximately million at december   representing and of our total assets  respectively 
we invest excess cash in investment grade fixed income securities  including united states treasury obligations and corporate securities 
we believe that our current financial resources and sources of liquidity are adequate to fund operations into based upon our expectations of the level of research and development  marketing and administrative activities necessary to achieve our strategic objectives 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information for the twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended december  net loss adjustments for non cash operating items net cash operating loss net change in assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities 
table of contents net cash used in operating activities our operating cash outflows for and have resulted primarily from research and development expenditures associated with our product candidates  including clinical development and manufacturing development costs for entereg  and for the compensation of our employees 
these outflows were reduced by cost reimbursement amounts received from glaxo  and in by the million upfront payment received from glaxo 
operating cash flow requirements outlook we expect to continue to use cash resources to fund operating losses 
we expect that our revenue for contract reimbursement under our collaboration agreement with glaxo will decline in future periods as compared to as expenses related to the poi clinical development program decrease 
we expect that other operating expenses will increase in future periods as a result of manufacturing scale up efforts and in preparation for potential commercialization of our product candidates 
we expect that as glaxo incurs increasing expenses under our collaboration related to the obd program in the united states  we will incur substantial expenses relating to our reimbursements owed to glaxo 
further  we may in license or acquire product candidates which will require additional cash outlays 
contractual commitments lease payments future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases for equipment and office and laboratory space are approximately as follows year ending december  beyond glaxo collaboration agreement under the terms of the glaxo agreement  we will partially reimburse glaxo for third party expenses incurred by them in the development of entereg for certain indications in the united states  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget which is subject to annual review 
we also expect to incur certain expenses in the development of entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget  for certain other indications in the united states  a portion of which are reimbursable to us by glaxo 
we expect to record these expenses as incurred 
other service agreements we have entered into various agreements for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services 
we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 

table of contents license and research agreements with regard to our product  entereg  we have commitments to roberts and eli lilly 
in november  roberts licensed from eli lilly certain intellectual property rights relating to entereg 
in june  we entered into an option and license agreement with roberts under which we licensed from roberts the rights roberts had licensed from eli lilly for entereg 
as of december   we have paid  to roberts 
under our option and license agreement we are obligated to pay milestone payments to roberts and eli lilly upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones that in the aggregate may total up to million 
we are also responsible for the costs to develop entereg 
in addition  if entereg receives regulatory approval  we are obligated to pay royalties to roberts and eli lilly on commercial sales of entereg 
under the terms of our arrangements  the license to entereg expires on the later of either the life of the last to expire of the licensed eli lilly patents or fifteen years from november   following which we will have a fully paid up license 
in august  we entered into a separate exclusive license agreement with eli lilly under which we obtained an exclusive license to six issued us patents  related foreign equivalents and know how relating to peripherally selective opioid antagonists 
we paid eli lilly million upon signing the agreement and are subject to additional clinical and regulatory milestone payments and royalty payments to eli lilly on sales  if any  of new products utilizing the licensed technology 
under this license agreement  we also agreed to pay eli lilly a million dollar payment upon acceptance by a regulatory authority of the first application for marketing authorization for entereg 
in july  we entered into an agreement with epicept under which we licensed exclusive rights to develop and commercialize in north america a sterile lidocaine patch which is being developed for the management of postoperative incisional pain 
we made a million payment to epicept upon execution of the agreement and may make up to million in additional development milestone payments if certain clinical and regulatory achievements are reached 
the million payment was recorded as research and development expense in as the underlying technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative uses 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and relates primarily to investments made in investment securities 
capital expenditures in and were primarily for leasehold improvements associated with our newly leased facility  purchases of laboratory equipment  furniture and fixtures and office equipment 
investing requirements outlook we expect to continue to require investments in information technology  laboratory and office equipment to support our research and development activities  and potential commercialization activities 
operations are expected to be funded through the maturity of investments in our portfolio 
net cash provided by financing activities in november we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock  which yielded proceeds of million  net of offering costs 
during and  we received million and million  respectively  from stock option exercises 
financing requirements outlook we do not expect to generate positive cash flows from operations for at least the next several years  if at all 
we expect to continue to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund operating and investing activities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of 
table of contents approximately million as of december  will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements into prior to exhausting our current cash reserve  we will need to raise additional funds to finance our operating activities 
if we do not raise additional cash  we may be required to curtail or limit certain marketing support and research and development activities 
a curtailment of certain activities would delay or possibly prevent development of certain of our products 
we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings or strategic alliances with third parties 
these financings could result in substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock 
any such required financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion above under liquidity and capital resources 
revenues 
revenues decreased in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in expenses incurred by us which are reimburseable by glaxo under the collaboration agreement  partially offset by the recording in of a full year s amortization of the glaxo signing fee 
revenues increased in as compared to primarily due to the execution of the glaxo collaboration in  which resulted in significant cost reimbursement and license fee revenue 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expense  costs of clinical trials  costs to manufacture product candidates  technology licensing costs  laboratory supply costs and facility related costs 
research and development expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due principally to a decrease of approximately million in expenditures associated with clinical testing of entereg  as well as a decrease in technology license fees of approximately million  offset partially by an increase of approximately million for personnel related expenses and laboratory supply and facility related expenses 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to an increase of in expenses associated with the clinical testing of entereg  as well as higher personnel costs and a license fee payment of million to eli lilly and company 
our research and development expenses can be identified as internal or external expenses 
internal expenses include expenses such as personnel  laboratory  and overhead related expenses 
these expenses totaled million  million  and million in the years ended december    and respectively  and are largely related to our entereg development efforts 
external expenses include expenses incurred with clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  and other third party vendors and can be allocated to significant research and development programs as follows years ended december  entereg program sterile patch program other programs total due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the preclinical and clinical studies associated with each of our research and development programs  the cost to complete such programs  as well as the period in which net cash inflows from significant programs are expected to commence  are not reasonably estimable 
preclinical and clinical studies may yield varying results that could delay  limit or prevent a program s advancement through the various stages of product development  and significantly impact the costs to be incurred  and time involved  in bringing a program to completion 

table of contents marketing  general and administrative expenses 
our marketing  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these changes are primarily due to non cash charges recorded in in connection with the acceleration of the vesting of certain stock options and compensation expenses recorded in in connection with payments to be made under separation agreements  as well as certain financial advisory and legal fees incurred in conjunction with the execution of the glaxo agreement 
other income expense 
our other income decreased in as compared to  and in as compared to  due to a reduction in average investment balances and lower interest rates in the later years as compared to the prior years 
net loss outlook our net loss for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
we have not generated any product sales revenues and have not achieved profitable operations 
our deficit accumulated during the development stage through december  aggregated approximately million  and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods 
we are highly dependent on the success of our research  development and licensing efforts and  ultimately  upon regulatory approval and market acceptance of our products under development 
we may never become profitable and even if we become profitable  we may not be able to sustain profitability on a continuing basis 
income taxes as of december   we had approximately  of federal and  of state net operating loss carryforwards potentially available to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in and  respectively  if not utilized 
in addition  the utilization of the state net operating loss carryforwards is subject to a million annual limitation 
at december   we also had approximately  of federal and  of state research and development tax credit carryforwards  which begin expiring in  and are available to reduce federal and state income taxes 
the tax reform act of the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we may have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings 
additionally  because united states tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes

certain risks related to our business as further described herein  our performance and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  the following specific risks we are highly dependent on achieving success in the clinical testing  regulatory approval and commercialization of our lead product candidate  entereg tm  which may never be approved for commercial use 
we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of entereg  and our potential to achieve revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future is dependent upon successfully commercializing entereg 
prior to commercialization of entereg in the united states  we will have to submit  and the fda will have to approve  an nda for entereg 
drug development is a highly uncertain process 
we or glaxo  with whom we are collaborating to develop entereg  may suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials of entereg  even after achieving potentially promising results in earlier clinical trials 
our entereg poi phase iii program consists of four studies  poi cl  poi cl  poi cl and poi cl while we have reported top line results from these studies  the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the fda or any other regulatory agency in an application for regulatory approval for entereg 
we are targeting submission of an nda for entereg for the management of postoperative ileus late in the first half of we may not meet our submission target 
even if we submit this nda we may not receive fda approval for entereg for the management of postoperative ileus 
adverse safety findings from one or more of our clinical trials will adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for entereg 
additional clinical trials of entereg  conducted by us or our collaborator  glaxo  could produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in our clinical trials conducted to date 
in addition  in patients who take multiple medication  drug interactions with entereg could occur that can be difficult to predict 
these events  among others  may make it more difficult for us to obtain regulatory approval for entereg 
the most frequent adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups in study poi cl were nausea  vomiting and abdominal dystension 
the most frequent adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups in study poi cl were nausea  vomiting and hypotension 
the most frequent adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups in study poi cl were nausea  vomiting and constipation 
the most frequent adverse events in both the placebo and treatment groups in study poi cl were nausea  vomiting and pruritis 
our entereg clinical trials are testing whether entereg is able to selectively block the effects of narcotic analgesics in the gastrointestinal tract 
as combination clinical trials  they are subject to the risk that the use of entereg with narcotic analgesics may result in unexpected toxicity  or increase the side effects associated with the individual products to an unacceptable level  or interfere with the efficacy of the narcotic analgesic 
in addition  assessing clinical trial results of entereg in combination with narcotic analgesics may add to the complexity of interpreting the study results 

table of contents even if we conclude that the results from our preclinical studies and clinical trials of entereg are positive  the fda may not agree with us 
while we believe the results of studies poi cl  poi cl  poi cl and poi cl  support our goal of submitting an nda for entereg  there can be no assurance that the fda will concur with that assessment 
the fda may evaluate the results by different methods or conclude that the clinical trial results are not statistically significant or clinically meaningful  or that there were human errors in the conduct of the clinical trials or otherwise 
even if we believe we have met the fda guidelines for submission of data and information to the nda  there is a risk that the fda will require additional data and information that we are unable to provide 
while the fda has designated entereg as a fast track product  there is no assurance that such designation will expedite the review of our nda by fda  and such designation does not increase the likelihood of approval of our nda 
there can also be no assurance that entereg will be granted priority review status by fda 
if we are unable to commercialize entereg  our ability to generate revenues will be impaired and our business will be harmed 
we have not yet commercialized any products or technologies  and we may never be able to do so 
if our nda for entereg is not approved by the fda  or if approval is delayed  our ability to achieve revenues from product sales will be impaired and our stock price will be materially and adversely affected 
fda approval is contingent on many factors  including clinical trial results and the evaluation of those results 
even if entereg is approved by the fda for marketing  we will not be successful unless entereg gains market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance of entereg will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of entereg and its potential advantages over competitive products  and pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  such as insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators 
physicians  patients  payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept  utilize or recommend entereg 
certain results from our clinical trials show that the differences between our product candidates and placebos are not statistically significant 
in study poi cl  the mg entereg treatment group s difference from placebo was not statistically significant 
in study poi cl  neither the mg nor the mg treatment groups difference from placebo was statistically significant 
even though the p value for the mg dose group of study poi cl was below  it was not considered formally statistically significant because of the multiple dose comparison 
in studies involving multiple comparisons  statisticians control the overall study error rate ie the likelihood that the drug response occurred by chance by requiring that each of the multiple dose comparisons meet a p value of p to show statistical significance 
in the event that one of the dose comparisons in any of these poi phase iii studies does not reach a significance level of p  the other dose comparison in that study needs to reach a significance level of p to be considered statistically significant 
these results may make it more difficult to achieve regulatory approval of entereg 

table of contents patients may discontinue their participation in our clinical studies  which may negatively impact the results of these studies  and extend the timeline for completion of our development programs 
the time required to complete clinical trails is dependent upon  among other factors  the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the clinical protocol requirements  the diversion of patients to other trials or marketed therapies  our ability to recruit and manage clinical centers and associated trials  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  and the patient eligibility criteria for the study 
we are subject to the risk that patients enrolled in our clinical studies may discontinue their participation at any time during the study as a result of a number of factors  including  withdrawing their consent or experiencing adverse clinical events which may or may not be related to our product candidates under evaluation 
we are subject to the risk that if a large number of patients in any one of our studies discontinue their participation in the study  the results from that study may not be positive or may not support an nda for regulatory approval of our product candidates 
in clinical study poi cl  discontinuation rates were   and in the placebo group  mg dose group and mg dose group  respectively 
this resulted in fewer efficacy evaluable patients in the placebo and mg treatment groups compared to the mg treatment group 
following the analysis of study poi cl  we increased enrollment in studies poi cl and poi cl  with the objective of potentially increasing the number of efficacy evaluable patients in each dose group in our ongoing studies 
in study poi cl discontinuation rates were  and in the placebo  mg and mg dose groups  respectively 
in study poi cl discontinuation rates were  and in the placebo  mg and mg treatment groups  respectively 
we may not be able to successfully develop entereg for use in treating chronic opioid bowel dysfunction obd 
we have completed several phase ii trials and one phase iii clinical trial studying the use of entereg for the reversal of the severe constipating effects associated with chronic use of opioids 
the overall responsibility for the development of entereg in chronic indications is now carried on by glaxo 
additional long term animal toxicity studies are necessary to support further development of entereg in obd 
adverse safety findings in these long term animal toxicity studies could adversely affect our prospects for entereg  including its prospects for use in poi 
results from the clinical studies conducted to date in obd are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be obtained in further obd studies  or in the on going clinical studies in the poi indication 
additional studies for chronic obd investigating longer duration of patient exposure and different dosing strategies  as well as preclinical toxicology studies  will be required prior to initiating the confirming clinical studies required to be successfully completed before any nda could be filed for use of entereg in obd 
our stock price may be volatile  and your investment in our stock could decline in value 
we may become involved in securities class action litigation 
the market price for our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future 
for example  in the calendar year ended december   the closing price of our common stock reached a low of per share in march and a high of per share in december 
table of contents the market price for our common stock is highly dependent on the success of our product development efforts  and in particular  clinical trial results  and regulatory review results 
the following additional factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock developments concerning our collaborations  including our collaboration with glaxo  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by our competitors or us  regulatory developments in the united states and foreign countries  litigation  economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises  period to period fluctuations in our financial results  and the general performance of the equity markets and in particular  the biopharmaceutical sector of the equity markets 
following periods of volatility and decline in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation of this type is often extremely expensive and diverts management s attention and resources 
if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  of approximately million will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements into we have generated operating losses since we began operations in november we expect to continue to generate such losses and will need additional funds that may not be available in the future 
we have no products that have generated any revenue  and as of december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
during the calendar years ended december  and  we incurred operating losses of approximately million and million  respectively  and net losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
even if we succeed in developing a commercial product  we expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years and expect that these losses will increase as we expand our research and development and sales and marketing activities 
if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be forced to curtail our operations and we will be unable to develop products successfully 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or to us 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  products or technologies or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited  and we may have to reduce or cease our operations 
if additional funds become available there can be no assurance that we can predict the time and costs required to complete development programs or that we will not substantially exceed our budgets 
we are dependent on our collaborators to perform their obligations under our collaboration agreements 
in april  we and glaxo entered into a collaboration agreement for the exclusive worldwide development and commercialization of entereg for certain indications 
we and glaxo agreed to develop entereg for a number of indications  both acute and chronic  which would potentially involve the use of entereg in in patient and out patient settings 
in the united states  we have the right to co develop and 
table of contents co promote entereg with glaxo  and share development expenses and commercial returns  if any  pursuant to contractually agreed percentages 
we have overall responsibility for the development of acute care indications such as poi  and glaxo has overall responsibility for the development of chronic care indications such as obd 
we and glaxo are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the indications for which we and they are respectively responsible 
we and glaxo have established numerous joint committees to collaborate in the development of entereg 
these committees meet at regularly scheduled intervals 
we depend on glaxo to provide us with substantial assistance and expertise in the development of entereg 
any failure of glaxo to perform its obligations under our agreement could negatively impact our product candidate  entereg  and could lead to our loss of potential revenues from product sales and milestones that may otherwise become due under our collaboration agreement and would delay our achievement  if any  of profitability 
glaxo has extensive experience in the successful commercialization of product candidates which it would be difficult for us to replace if the collaboration agreement was not in place 
in the near term  our success will largely depend upon the success of our collaboration with glaxo to further develop entereg and our success in obtaining regulatory approval to commercialize entereg 
the term of the collaboration agreement varies depending on the indication and the territory 
the term of the collaboration agreement for the poi indication in the united states is ten years from the first commercial sale of entereg in that indication  if any 
generally the term for the obd indication in the united states is fifteen years from the first commercial sale of entereg in that indication  if any 
in the rest of the world  the term is generally fifteen years from the first commercial sale of entereg  if any  on a country by country and indication by indication basis 
glaxo has certain rights to terminate the collaboration agreement 
glaxo also has the right to terminate its rights and obligations with respect to the acute care indications  or its rights and obligations for the chronic care indications 
glaxo has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement for breach of the agreement by us or for safety related reasons as defined in the collaboration agreement 
glaxo s rights to terminate the acute care indications or the chronic care indications are generally triggered by failure to achieve certain milestones within certain timeframes  adverse product developments or adverse regulatory events 
if glaxo terminates the collaboration agreement  we may not be able to find a new collaborator to replace glaxo  and our business will be adversely affected 
our corporate collaborators  including glaxo  may determine not to proceed with one or more of our drug discovery and development programs 
if one or more of our corporate collaborators reduces or terminates funding  we will have to devote additional internal resources to product development or scale back or terminate some development programs or seek alternative corporate collaborators 
our ability to enter into new collaborations and to achieve success under existing collaborations is uncertain 
we have entered into  and may in the future enter into  collaborative arrangements  including our arrangement with glaxo  for the marketing  sales and distribution of our product candidates  which require  or may require  us to share profits or revenues 
we may be unable to enter into additional collaborative licensing or other arrangements that we need to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
moreover  we may not realize the contemplated benefits from such collaborative licensing or other arrangements 
these arrangements may place responsibility on our collaborative partners for preclinical testing  human clinical trials  the preparation and submission of applications for regulatory approval  or for marketing  sales and distribution support for product commercialization 
these arrangements may also require us to transfer certain material rights or issue our equity securities to corporate partners  licensees and others 
any license or sublicense of our commercial rights may reduce our product revenue 
moreover  we may not derive any revenues or profits from these arrangements 
we cannot be certain that any of these parties  including glaxo  will fulfill their obligations in a manner consistent with our best interests 
collaborators may also pursue alternative technologies or drug candidates  either on their own or in collaboration with others  that are in direct competition with us 

table of contents our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on the initiation of new corporate collaboration agreements  the activities under current corporate collaboration agreements or the termination of existing corporate collaboration agreements 
we may not be able to successfully develop in licensed product candidates  which could prevent us from commercializing any such candidates 
we intend to explore opportunities to expand our product portfolio by acquiring or in licensing products and or product development candidates 
in july  we entered into an agreement with epicept  under which we obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize in north america a sterile lidocaine patch which is being developed for the management of postoperative incisional pain 
although we conduct extensive evaluations of product candidate opportunities as part of our due diligence efforts  there can be no assurance that our product development efforts related thereto will be successful or that we will not become aware of issues or complications that will cause us to alter  delay or terminate our product development efforts 
additionally  while we have built certain capabilities as an organization in executing the development plan for entereg  in licensed products such as this sterile patch product will require capabilities and expertise which we do not currently possess  and there is no assurance that we will be able to develop or acquire these capabilities 
if we do not develop or acquire these capabilities  we may not be able to commercialize our in licensed products and technologies 
because our product candidates are in development  there is a high risk that further development and testing will demonstrate that our product candidates are not suitable for commercialization 
we have no products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
all of our product candidates  including entereg  are in development  and we face the substantial risks of failure inherent in developing drugs based on new technologies 
our product candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before the fda and foreign regulatory authorities will approve them for commercial use 
to satisfy these standards  we will need to conduct significant additional research  animal testing  or preclinical testing  and human testing  or clinical trials 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
failure can occur at any stage of testing 
success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful 
based on results at any stage of clinical trials  we may decide to discontinue development of our product candidates 
we may suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
product candidates that appear to be promising at earlier stages of development may not reach the market or be marketed successfully for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  the following researchers may find during later preclinical testing or clinical trials that the product candidate is ineffective or has harmful side effects  the number and types of patients available for extensive clinical trials may vary  new information about the mechanisms by which a drug candidate works may adversely affect its development  one or more competing products may be approved for the same or a similar disease condition  raising the hurdles to approval of the product candidate  the product candidate may fail to receive necessary regulatory approval or clearance  or competitors may market equivalent or superior products 

table of contents we have limited commercial manufacturing capability and expertise 
if we are unable to contract with third parties to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities  at an acceptable cost and in compliance with regulatory requirements  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals  or to meet demand for our products 
completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates require access to  or development of  facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates 
we have depended and expect to continue to depend on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical  clinical and commercial purposes 
it is difficult and expensive to change contract manufacturers for pharmaceutical products  particularly when the products are under regulatory review in an nda process 
we currently do not have long term supply agreements with our third party manufacturers 
we may not be able to contract for the manufacture of sufficient quantities of the products we develop  or even to meet our needs for pre clinical or clinical development 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our future profit margin and our ability to commercialize products  if any are approved  on a timely and competitive basis 
to receive regulatory approval for entereg  our contract manufacturers will be required to obtain approval for their manufacturing facilities to manufacture entereg  and there is a risk that such approval may not be obtained 
we will be required to submit  in an nda  information and data regarding chemistry  manufacturing and controls which satisfies the fda that our contract manufacturers are able to make entereg in accordance with cgmps 
under cgmps  our manufacturers will be required to manufacture our products and maintain records in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and quality control activities 
we are dependent on our third party manufacturers to comply with these regulations in the manufacture of our products and these parties may have difficulties complying with cgmps 
the failure of any third party manufacturer to comply with applicable government regulations could substantially harm and delay or prevent regulatory approval and marketing of entereg 
our products may be in competition with other products for access to facilities of third parties and suitable alternatives may be unavailable 
consequently  our products may be subject to delays in manufacture if outside contractors give other products greater priority than our products 
we maintain a relationship with torcan chemical ltd 
for the supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api in entereg 
we also maintain a relationship with girindus ag as an additional supplier of api for entereg 
we maintain a relationship with pharmaceutics international inc for the supply of entereg finished capsules  and a relationship with sharp corporation for the packaging of entereg finished capsules 
we have no formal commercial supply arrangement as yet with any of these parties 
we also rely upon these parties for the performance of scale up and other development activities  and for the maintenance and testing of product pursuant to applicable stability programs 
clinical trials in our phase iii entereg program use drug product incorporating active pharmaceutical ingredient manufactured by two different contract manufacturing facilities  one of which is no longer in business 
our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for entereg may be impaired as a result of using material from two different contract manufacturing facilities 
we also expect to depend on third parties to manufacture product candidates we may acquire or in license  including the sterile patch product we in licensed from epicept 
we have no experience in manufacturing sterile patch products and will need to develop our own internal capabilities and external relationships in that regard  as well as assess the capabilities of third party manufacturers that have been involved in the manufacture of this product candidate to date 
if we are unable to develop sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions  we will not be able to commercialize products 
we currently have no sales or distribution capability and limited marketing capabilities 
in order to commercialize products  if any are approved  we must internally develop sales  marketing and distribution 
table of contents capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
if we obtain regulatory approval  we intend to sell some products directly in certain markets and rely on relationships with established pharmaceutical companies to sell products in certain markets 
to sell any of our products directly  we must develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
we may not be able to establish in house sales and distribution capabilities or relationships with third parties 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements  our product revenues may be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products  and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  which efforts may not be successful 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval and depend on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
we have limited experience in managing clinical trials  and delays or terminations of clinical trials we are conducting or may undertake in the future could impair our development of product candidates 
delay or termination of any clinical trials could result from a number of factors  including adverse events  stringent enrollment requirements  slow rate of enrollment  competition with other clinical trials for eligible patients and other factors 
we are subject to the risk that subjects enrolled in our clinical studies may discontinue their participation at anytime during the study as a result of a number of factors  including  withdrawing their consent or experiencing adverse clinical events which may or may not be judged related to our product candidates under evaluation 
we contract with third parties to conduct our clinical trials  and are subject to the risk that these third parties fail to perform their obligations properly and in compliance with applicable fda and other governmental regulations 
the failure of any third party to comply with any governmental regulations would substantially harm our development efforts and delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates 
the concept of developing peripherally acting opioid antagonist drugs is relatively new and may not lead to commercially successful drugs 
peripherally acting compounds given to patients as potential drugs are designed to exert their effects outside the brain and spinal cord  in contrast to centrally acting compounds which are designed to exert their effects on the brain or spinal cord 
we are developing entereg as a peripherally acting opioid antagonist 
an opioid antagonist is designed to block the effects of the opioid at the receptor level  in the case of entereg  it is designed to block the unwanted effects of opioid analgesics on the gastrointestinal tract 
since there are no products on the market comparable to our product candidates  we do not have any historical or comparative sales data to rely upon to indicate that peripherally acting opioid antagonist drugs will achieve commercial success in the marketplace 
market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors  including perceptions by members of the health care community  including physicians  of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  cost effectiveness of our product candidates relative to competing products  the availability of government or third party payor reimbursement for our product candidates  and the effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us  our collaborators and our licensees and distributors 
other products that are currently sold for pain management are already recognized as safe and effective and have a history of successful sales in the united states and elsewhere 
our new products in this area  if any  will be competing with drugs that have been approved by the fda and have demonstrated commercial success in the united states and elsewhere 

table of contents our product candidate entereg is under investigation for use in patients taking opioid analgesics and reduction in the use of opioid analgesics would therefore reduce the potential market for entereg 
if the use of drugs or techniques which reduce the requirement for mu opioids increases  the demand for entereg would be decreased 
various techniques to reduce the use of opioids are used in an attempt to reduce the impact of opioid side effects 
the use of local anesthetics in epidural catheters during and after surgery with the continuation of the epidural into the post operative period can reduce or eliminate the use of opioids 
non steroidal inflammatory agents may also reduce total opioid requirements 
continuous infusion of local anesthetic into a wound or near major nerves can reduce the use of opioids in limited types of procedures and pain states 
novel analgesics which act at non mu opioid receptors are under development 
many companies have developed and are developing analgesic products that compete with opioids or which  if approved  would compete with opioids 
if these analgesics reduce the use of opioids  it would have a negative impact on the potential market for entereg 
if competitors develop and market products that are more effective  have fewer side effects  are less expensive than our product candidates or offer other advantages  our commercial opportunities will be limited 
other companies have product candidates in development to treat the conditions we are seeking to ultimately treat and they may develop effective and commercially successful products 
our competitors may succeed in developing products either that are more effective than those that we may develop  or that they market before we market any products we may develop 
we believe that progenics pharmaceuticals  inc is developing methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid bowel dysfunction and poi 
we also believe a european specialist pharmaceutical company with a focus on the gastrointestinal market  is in preclinical development in the area of peripherally acting opioid antagonists for use in opioid induced constipation 
there are products already on the market for use in treating irritable bowel syndrome which may be evaluated for utility in opioid induced bowel dysfunction 
there may be additional competitive products about which we are not aware 
if our competitors are able to reach the commercial market before we are  this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to reach the commercial market and sell our products 
our competitors include fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  universities and public and private research institutions 
many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals  and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel  attract partners for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations  and license proprietary technology 
our business could suffer if we cannot attract  retain and motivate skilled personnel and cultivate key academic collaborations 
we are a small company  and our success depends on our continued ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific personnel  including our president and chief executive officer  bruce a 
peacock 
our success also depends on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions and scientists 
competition for personnel and academic collaborations is intense 
in particular  our product development programs depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled chemists  biologists and clinical development personnel 
if we lose the services of any of these personnel it could impede significantly the achievement of our research and development 
table of contents objectives 
in addition  we will need to hire additional personnel and develop additional academic collaborations as we continue to expand our research and development activities 
we do not know if we will be able to attract  retain or motivate personnel or maintain relationships 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
companies and universities that have licensed technology and product candidates to us are sophisticated entities that could develop similar products to compete with products we hope to develop 
licensing product candidates from other companies  universities  or individuals does not prevent such parties from developing competitive products for their own commercial purposes  nor from pursuing patent protection in areas that are competitive with us 
the individuals who created these technologies are sophisticated scientists and business people who may continue to do research and development and seek patent protection in the same areas that led to the discovery of the product candidates that they licensed to us 
the development and commercialization by us of successful products is also likely to attract additional research by our licensors and by other investigators who have experience in developing products for the pain management market 
by virtue of their previous research activities these companies  universities  or individuals may be able to develop and market competitive products in less time than might be required to develop a product with which they have no prior experience 
if we breach our licensing agreements  we will lose significant benefits and may be exposed to liability for damages 
we may breach our license agreements and may thereby lose rights that are important 
we are subject to various obligations with respect to license agreements  including development responsibilities  royalty and other payments and regulatory obligations 
if we fail to comply with these requirements or otherwise breach a license agreement or contract  the licensor or other contracting party may have the right to terminate the license or contract in whole or in part or change the exclusive nature of the arrangement 
in such event we would not only lose all or part of the benefit of the arrangement but also may be exposed to potential liabilities for breach in the form of damages or other penalties 
because we are not certain we will obtain necessary regulatory approvals to market our products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize any of our products 
the pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulation by a wide range of authorities 
we cannot predict whether we will obtain regulatory clearance for any product candidate we develop 
we cannot market a pharmaceutical product in the united states until it has completed rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and the fda s extensive regulatory clearance process 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources for research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
since neither the fda nor international regulatory authorities have approved peripherally restricted narcotic antagonist drugs for marketing  there is additional uncertainty as to whether our research and clinical approaches to developing new products for the pain management market will lead to drugs that the fda will consider safe and effective for indicated uses 
before receiving fda approval to market a product  we must demonstrate that the product candidate is safe and effective in the patient population that will be treated 
outside the united states  our ability to market a product is also contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities  and is subject to similar risks and uncertainties 
we do not know whether our current or future preclinical and clinical studies will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals  or will result in marketable products 
any failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates will prevent receipt of 
table of contents fda and foreign regulatory approvals and  ultimately  commercialization of our product candidates 
regulatory authorities may refuse or delay approval as a result of many other factors  including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and regulatory interpretations of clinical benefit and clinical risk 
regulatory clearance that we may receive for a product candidate will be limited to those diseases and conditions for which we have demonstrated in clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and efficacious 
even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates we must comply with applicable fda post marketing regulations and other regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could subject us to criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other regulatory actions against our product or us 
if we market our products in a manner that violates health care fraud and abuse laws  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
in addition to fda restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products  several other types of state and federal health care fraud and abuse laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years 
these laws include antikickback statutes and false claims statutes 
the federal health care program antikickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting  or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing  leasing  ordering  or arranging for the purchase  lease  or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid  or other federally financed healthcare programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers  purchasers  and formulary managers on the other 
although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases  or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from antikickback liability 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
recently  several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal antikickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payor 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors  it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws 
such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the federal controlled substances act might impose significant restrictions  licensing and regulatory requirements on the manufacturing  distribution and dispensing of certain of our product candidates 
the federal controlled substances act imposes significant licensing  recordkeeping  reporting  prescribing  and other regulatory requirements on the manufacturing  distribution and dispensing of controlled substances 
therefore  we must determine whether the drug enforcement administration dea would consider any of our product candidates to be a controlled substance 
we believe that it is unlikely that any of our product candidates other than those which may act on the central nervous system may be subject to regulation as controlled substances 

table of contents facilities that conduct research  manufacture or distribute controlled substances must be registered with dea to perform these activities and have the security  control and accounting systems required by the dea to prevent loss and diversion 
failure to maintain compliance  particularly as manifested in loss or diversion  can result in significant regulatory action 
in addition  individual state laws may also impose separate regulatory restrictions and requirements  including licenses  recordkeeping and reporting 
we may not obtain fda approval to conduct clinical trials that are necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements 
clinical trials are subject to oversight by institutional review boards and the fda and must conform with the fda s good clinical practice regulations  must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight  must meet requirements for informed consent  are subject to continuing fda oversight  and may require large numbers of test subjects 
before commencing clinical trials in humans  we must submit and receive approval from the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind 
we  or the fda  may suspend clinical trials at any time if the subjects participating in the trials are exposed to unacceptable health risks  or if the fda finds deficiencies in the ind application or the conduct of the trials 
it is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights  and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights  we may be sued by others for infringing their intellectual property rights 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent protection on our products and successfully defending these patents against third party challenges 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
accordingly  we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in our patents or those of our collaborators 
others have filed and in the future are likely to file patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar  identical or competitive to ours  or important to our business 
we cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications filed or in licensed by us  or that we or our licensors will not be involved in interference proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office 
although no third party has asserted a claim of infringement against us  others may hold proprietary rights that will prevent our product candidates from being marketed unless we can obtain a license to those proprietary rights 
any patent related legal action against our collaborators or us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our products and processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require our collaborators or us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
we cannot predict whether we or our collaborators would prevail in any of these actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
there has been  and we believe that there will continue to be  significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in litigation  it could consume substantial managerial and financial resources 
we rely on trade secrets to protect technology in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
while we require employees  academic collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements  we may not be able to protect adequately our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
our research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights 
table of contents to publish data and information in which we have rights 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations  our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information may be imperiled 
others may hold proprietary rights that will prevent our product candidates from being marketed unless we are able to obtain a license to those proprietary rights 
we are a party to various license agreements that give us rights to use specified technologies in our research and development processes 
if we are not able to continue to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms  our product development and research may be delayed 
in addition  we generally do not fully control the prosecution of patents relating to in licensed technology  and accordingly are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we exercise over our internally developed technology 
our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from third party payors 
our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products  alone or with collaborators  may depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities  or private health insurers and third party payors 
the continuing efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means may limit our commercial opportunity 
for example  in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement pharmaceutical pricing and cost control measures under government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid 
for example  federal legislation was enacted on december   which provides a new medicare prescription drug benefit beginning in and mandates other reforms 
although we cannot predict the full effects on our business of the implementation of this new legislation  it is possible that the new medicare benefit  which will be managed by private health insurers  pharmacy benefit managers  and other managed care organizations  will result in decreased reimbursement for prescription drugs  which may further exacerbate industry wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for prescription drugs 
this could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states will continue to put pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that any of our collaborators or we would receive for any products in the future and may impede patients ability to obtain reimbursement under their insurance program for our products 
further  cost control initiatives could adversely affect our collaborators ability to commercialize our products  and our ability to realize royalties from such commercialization 
if we engage in an acquisition or business combination  we will incur a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business operations or our stockholders 
from time to time we have considered  and we will continue to consider in the future  if and when any appropriate opportunities become available  strategic business initiatives intended to further the development of our business 
these initiatives may include acquiring businesses  technologies or products or entering into a business combination with another company 
if we do pursue such a strategy  we could  among other things issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt that may place strains on our operations  spend substantial operational  financial and management resources in integrating new businesses  technologies and products  
table of contents assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities  or merge with or otherwise enter into a business combination with  another company in which our stockholders would receive cash or shares of the other company or a combination of both on terms that our stockholders may not deem desirable 
we are not in a position to predict what  if any  collaborations  alliances or other transactions may result or how  when or if these activities would have a material effect on us or the development of our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may have to limit or cease commercialization of our products 
the testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or cease commercialization of our products 
we currently carry clinical trial insurance at a level we believe is commercially reasonable but do not carry product liability insurance 
our corporate collaborators or we may not be able to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
there is no assurance that our clinical trial insurance will be adequate to cover claims that may arise 
we enter into indemnification agreements where we indemnify third parties such as investigators for certain product liability claims related to our products under investigation 
these indemnification obligations may cause us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications 
if we use biological and hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury or violates laws  we may be liable for damages 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
we use radioactivity in conducting biological assays and we use solvents that could be flammable in conducting our research and development activities 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use  storage  handling or disposal of these materials 
we do not maintain a separate insurance policy for these types of risks 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for damages that result  and any liability could exceed our resources 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant 
certain provisions of our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
we have shares of our common stock and preferred stock available for future issuance without stockholder approval 
the existence of unissued common stock and preferred stock may enable our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management or to issue preferred stock with terms that could render more difficult or discourage a third party attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger  tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise  which would protect the continuity of our management 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for our board of directors to be divided into three classes  with the term of one such class expiring each year  and we have eliminated the ability of our stockholders to consent in writing to the taking of any action pursuant to section of the delaware general corporation law 

table of contents in addition  we adopted a shareholder rights plan  the effect of which may be to make an acquisition of the company more difficult 
under our collaboration agreement with glaxo  there are certain limitations on glaxo s ability to acquire our securities 
these limitations make it more difficult for glaxo to acquire us  even if such an acquisition would benefit our stockholders 
during and for one year after the term of the collaboration agreement  glaxo and its affiliates will not  alone or with others  except as permitted under limited circumstances acquire or agree to acquire  directly or indirectly  any direct or indirect beneficial ownership or interest in any of our securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for any of our securities  make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote in connection with us  form  join or in any way participate in a group with respect to our voting securities  acquire or agree to acquire  directly or indirectly  any of our assets or rights to acquire our assets  unless we are selling those assets at that time  or otherwise seek to change the control of us or propose any matter to be voted on by our stockholders or nominate any person as a director of us who is not nominated by the then incumbent directors 
the limitations on glaxo do not prevent glaxo  among other things  from acquiring our securities in certain circumstances following initiation by a third party of an unsolicited tender offer to purchase more than a certain percentage of any class of our publicly traded securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a substantial portion of our assets are investment grade fixed income securities including us treasury obligations  us government sponsored obligations and corporate securities 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  was million and the weighted average interest rate was approximately with maturities of up to months
