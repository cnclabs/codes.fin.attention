industry background active trader market the active trader market is usually defined as retail individuals  which include intra day or day traders  semi professionals  active self directed traders  people who trade for themselves as a full time or part time business endeavor  or any other individual that trades much more actively than the typical online trading account 
an active trader has historically been defined as one who trades a minimum of times per month 
the average tradestation brokerage account trades nearly five times that number 
the vast majority of active traders are believed to be with traditional online brokerage firms eg  ameritrade  e trade  fidelity  schwab  td waterhouse  td it is generally 
table of contents accepted in the online brokerage industry that to of each large online brokerage firm s client base consists of active traders 
nearly all of the large online brokerage firms have tried over the past three years to acquire direct access firms or technology  and more sophisticated trading analysis platforms  in order to retain and grow this most valuable segment of their client bases 
according to data and reports published over the last three to four years  there are estimated to be more than million online accounts  and direct access trading accounts have grown and have accounted for a higher percentage of trading activity of both nasdaq and listed securities 
based on industry articles published in the past two years  it appears that the majority of all order flow both listed and nasdaq is handled electronically 
active traders are generally believed to account for the majority of online daily trades and have larger account asset balances under current regulations  a minimum account balance of  is required for very active traders 
in the fourth quarter  the average account asset balance of a tradestation securities equities account was just under we believe an online brokerage focused on active traders  in order to maximize its potential for successful market penetration  needs to deliver direct access order placement and execution  including both automated and one click manual order placement capabilities state of the art advanced orders capabilities the ability to use various order placement features limits  trailing stops  simultaneous orders  contingency orders  reserve orders  hidden orders  pegged orders  discretionary orders  etc 
intelligent smart order routing access to most  if not all  major avenues of execution the major ecns  archipelago  supermontage  superdot  globex  a c e  the major electronic options exchanges  etc 
a competitive  per share commission pricing structure strategy testing and automation  as well as advanced charting and analysis  software tools streaming  real time quotes  including meaningful market depth displays trade desk  brokerage client and technical support services client training services tradestation securities offers each of the above mentioned features 
institutional trader market we see the institutional trader market  as it relates to potential client relationships for direct access brokerage firms like tradestation securities  as hedge fund and money managers  commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators  and registered investment advisers who use short term trading strategies 
according to data published in recent years  there are approximately  hedge funds today  which are estimated to manage billion of invested assets   commodity pool operators   registered investment advisors  registered commodity trading advisors and  unregistered commodity trading advisors 
many believe that buy side institutional traders have become less and less pleased with wall street traditional sell side brokerage firms and are moving  to one degree or another  towards using direct access execution of their trading decisions 
the biggest concern institutional traders 
table of contents are said to have today is that the cost of their trades not just commissions  but mainly the costs that result from adverse market movement caused by large block trades is no longer acceptable  particularly given the market conditions of the past three years 
accordingly  these institutional traders are looking for systems that provide the fastest execution at the best prices possible 
the fastest execution is provided by robust direct access technology  and the best prices possible means an exhaustive list of execution venues to ensure maximum access to liquidity through intelligent order routing 
it also means that the direct access platform offers stealthy execution of large block orders anonymity through advanced reserve order  hidden order  discretionary order and order pegging technology technology that enables the trade to be completed with minimal market disturbance 
these basics effective  robust  speedy execution  full liquidity access to all major electronic marketplaces  advanced order capabilities  and intelligent order routing  must be in place before an institutional fund manager or other institutional buy side trader will consider using a direct access brokerage firm 
these are all strengths of the tradestation electronic trading platform 
other features and services that are important to many buy side institutional traders include sophisticated decision support front ends  automated trading functionality  intuitive  manual one click order placement  advanced portfolio basket trading  multiple account trade allocation  a detailed  flexible order management portfolio management system or the ability to integrate their management systems with the direct access firm s order execution software  and a broad scope of assets stocks  options  futures and forex 
tradestation contains  arguably  the best decision support and automated trading and manual order placement functionality on the market  list basket trading  multiple account trade allocation  and state of the art direct access execution services for stocks  options and futures trading  and advanced analytics and electronic execution for forex trading  and is working to complete more advanced portfolio basket trading features and new order and risk management system compatibilities and features 
products and services overview tradestation our main product service offering is the tradestation electronic trading platform  complete with direct access order execution services  for institutional  professional and serious  active individual traders 
a formal patent application covering what we believe to be the unique  powerful technology of tradestation is pending 
tradestation does not provide investment or trading advice or recommendations  or recommend the use of any particular strategy  but rather enables the trader to design  test  optimize and automate his own  custom trading strategies 
tradestation is a registered trademark in the united states  australia  canada  the european union  indonesia  korea  singapore  south africa and taiwan 
in addition to offering the tradestation electronic trading platform to the brokerage customers of our tradestation securities subsidiary  we offer  through our tradestation technologies subsidiary  tradestation subscriptions 
the difference between the tradestation electronic trading platform and the tradestation subscription service is that the subscription service does not include order execution or account management capabilities 

table of contents tradestation has  since its initial release as a strategy trading software program in  been our flagship product 
from until october it was marketed worldwide to institutional traders on a monthly subscription basis by telerate  inc as a premium tool for the telerate data feed service 
it has also served  and continues to serve  as a strategy trading platform for numerous third party software applications 
its state of the art technology empowers the trader to design and develop a trading strategy based upon the trader s objective rules and criteria  test the potential profitability of that trading strategy against historical data  and then computer automate it to monitor the applicable market and alert the trader in real time when the criteria of the trading strategy have been met and an order should  therefore  be placed 
the principal features of tradestation which enable the trader to design and develop trading strategies are easylanguage and the powereditor 
easylanguage is a proprietary computer language we developed consisting of english like statements and trading terms which can be input by the trader to describe particular objective rules and criteria 
the powereditor is a compiler of easylanguage statements that provides the trader with considerable flexibility to modify and combine different trading rules and criteria  which ultimately result in the design of the trader s trading strategies 
easylanguage and powereditor are also registered trademarks 
brokerage services tradestation securities principal offering today is online brokerage services  covering equities  equities options  futures and forex transactions  through the tradestation electronic trading platform 
tradestation securities targeted customer base for brokerage services includes active individual  professional and institutional traders  including hedge fund and money managers and investment advisors who use short term trading strategies 
in addition to providing direct access online services through the tradestation electronic trading platform  the brokerage firm offers personal support services by its registered trade desk representatives who execute customers orders through direct access order execution systems if the customer is for some reason unable or unwilling to place the order using his or her own computer 
having a direct access order execution system  whether accessed directly by the brokerage client through the tradestation electronic trading platform or by a tradestation securities broker on behalf of the brokerage client  means that both the online services and the firm s trading desks are directly connected to stock  futures and options exchanges and ecn s 
ecn s  such as instinet inca island isld  bloomberg btrd and brass brut  and electronic equities exchanges such as the archipelago exchange arcx and supermontage from nasdaq  directly match anonymous buyers and sellers participating on the network 
this system often results in the simplest  most direct and speediest execution of orders for equity securities at the best available price 
with respect to electronically traded futures contracts  the tradestation electronic trading platform is directly connected to the cme globex  cbot a c e and onechicago electronic futures exchanges 
with respect to pit traded futures contracts  tradestation is directly connected to its futures clearing firm s online execution system which sends the order directly to the trading pit 
approximately of the company s futures trades are on the electronic futures exchanges 
with respect to options  the tradestation electronic trading platform is directly connected to major options exchanges that offer electronic trading  including cboe  ise  phlx and pcx  and membership applications to amex and box are pending 
with respect to forex deals  the tradestation electronic trading platform is directly connected to a third party forex dealer s online deal system  which then electronically places the forex orders 

table of contents client accounts for equity securities and futures currently are carried on a fully disclosed basis by the brokerage s clearing firms 
beginning in the summer of  tradestation securities plans to self clear equities trades made by its active trader client base 
tradestation securities executes its clients securities and futures transactions on an agency basis only  as opposed to a principal basis 
that is  it acts as the agent for its clients directly in the market 
when brokerage firms perform transactions on a principal basis  they are permitted to accept a client s order to purchase  purchase the securities in the market for the brokerage firm  and then sell the securities to the client 
tradestation securities does not do this 
it always charges only an agreed upon commission and never earns income from marking up or marking down its clients equities or futures transactions 
for forex deals  a forex dealer affiliated with our futures clearing firm acts as principal counterparty for  and clears  all deals with the company s forex clients

rj o brien foreign exchange is the counterparty principal for each forex deal 
technology development we believe that our success depends  in large part  on our ability to offer unique  internet based strategy trading technologies with state of the art  intelligent direct access order execution technologies  and continuously enhance those technologies  as well as develop and implement well designed and user friendly web sites 
to date  we have relied primarily on internal development of our products and services 
we currently perform all quality assurance and develop user education and other training materials internally 
in  and  technology development expenses were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   our technology development team was comprised of persons  as compared to as of december   a decrease 
we view our technology development cycle as a four step process to achieve technical feasibility 
the first step is to conceptualize in detail the defining features and functions that we 
table of contents believe our targeted market requires from the product or service  and to undertake a cost benefit analysis to determine the proper scope and integration of such features and functions 
once the functional requirements of the product or service have been determined  the second step is to technically design the product or service 
the third step is the detailed implementation  or engineering  of this technical design 
the fourth step is rigorous quality assurance testing to ensure that the final product or service generally meets the functional requirements determined in the first step 
several refinements are typically added and tested in the quality assurance phase of development 
once this process is completed  technological feasibility has been achieved and the working model is available for release to our customers 
the market for strategy trading software tools  streaming real time market data and news services  and online order execution services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards in computer hardware  programming tools and languages  operating systems  database technology and information delivery systems  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to develop and maintain competitive technologies and to develop and introduce new products  services and enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner that meets changing conditions such as evolving customer needs  existing and new competitive product and service offerings  emerging industry standards and changing technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and market  on a timely basis  if at all  products  services or enhancements that respond to changing market conditions or that will be accepted by customers 
any failure by us to anticipate or to respond quickly to changing market conditions  or any significant delays in the introduction of new products and services or enhancements  could cause customers to delay using  or decide against the use of  our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

tradestation securities provides telephone client service to its brokerage customers through a trained client service team

tradestationworld 
com  a web site owned and operated by tradestation technologies  is an interactive community for active traders who engage or have interest in the development  testing and use of objective trading strategies 
the community provides numerous discussion forums on a variety of topics related to strategy development and technical trading as well as tradestation product and service features  articles about trading from industry leaders  and a library of strategy indicators  rules and components written in our proprietary easylanguage  many of which are donated by third parties 
the company believes that tradestationworld

competition the market for online brokerage services is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there appears to be substantial consolidation in the industry in three different ways 
first  there has been over the past several years and continues to be consolidation of three types of services that traditionally were offered separately online brokerage services  real time market data services  and trading analysis software products and services 
with the tradestation electronic trading platform  we have embraced this consolidation by offering all three of these services in a fully integrated  seamless manner 
second  we believe consolidation is beginning to occur in the four major online execution markets for active traders equities  equities options  futures and forex meaning that  contrary to specializing in offering services for only one of those market instruments  more and more firms are offering or plan to offer three or four of those services 
with our offering of online trading services for all four of these markets  we have embraced this consolidation as well 
third  as a result of price pressure and competition over the last two years  we believe barriers of entry to  and the sustainability of  small online brokerage businesses have become more challenging 
as a result  many small online brokerage firms have  over the past few years  failed or been acquired by larger firms that are seeking to increase the size of their account base to help increase their ability to compete on price 
we believe we have advantages in this area 
the uniqueness of our trading technology enables us to charge value added fees to our clients  and the scalability and efficiencies made possible by that technology  coupled with the frequent trading activity of our client base  enable us to grow our daily average revenue trade activity with minimal increases in our fixed costs 
we believe that competition  including price competition  as well as consolidation  will substantially increase and intensify in the future 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control  including price pressure  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by us and our competitors  our ability to design and support efficient  materially error free internet based systems  market conditions  such as recession  the size of the active trader market today and in the future  the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use direct access brokerage services offered by firms that have traditionally served mostly retail clients  product and service functionality  data availability and cost  clearing costs  ease of use  reliability  customer service and support  and sales and marketing decisions and efforts 
we face direct competition from several publicly traded and privately held companies  principally online brokerages  including providers of direct access order execution services 
our 
table of contents competitors include the many online brokerages currently active in the united states  including ameritrade  inc which now includes datek online financial services llc  charles schwab co  inc including cybertrader  csfbdirect formerly dljdirect  e trade securities  incorporated  fidelity brokerage services  inc  instinet corporation a reuters subsidiary  and an ecn that also provides direct access brokerage service  interactive brokers  jpmorgan  merrill lynch direct  morgan stanley online  quick reilly  inc  redi products  a division of spear  leeds kellogg which is owned by goldman sachs  scottrade  td waterhouse investor services  inc  and terra nova 
those brokers currently serve  in the aggregate  more than of existing online accounts  and many are focusing on attracting and retaining active traders to and who use their services 
many online brokerages currently claim to offer direct access service 
even though we are rated as one of the best  if not the best  direct access brokerage firm in the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such ratings  be rated that highly in the future  compete effectively with our competitors  adequately educate potential customers about the benefits our products and services provide  or continue to offer such products and services 
many of our existing and potential competitors  which include large  online discount and traditional national brokerages  and financial institutions that are focusing more closely on online services  including direct access services for active traders  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base than do we 
further  there is the risk that larger financial institutions which offer online brokerage services as only one of many financial services may decide to use extremely low commission pricing as a loss leader to acquire and accumulate customer accounts and assets to derive interest income and income from their other financial services 
we do not offer other financial services  and have no plans to do so  therefore  such pricing techniques  should they become common in our industry  could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business model 
generally  competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services than are we 
there can be no assurance that our existing or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed and offered by us or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing customer requirements  or that we will be able to timely and adequately complete the implementation  and appropriately maintain and enhance the operation  of our business model 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins  failure to obtain any significant market share  or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property our success is and will be heavily dependent on proprietary software technology  including certain technology currently in development 
we view our software technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to establish 
table of contents and protect our proprietary rights 
we have a formal patent application pending for the tradestation trading platform  but software patents  particularly internet related software patents  are increasingly difficult to obtain  and there can be no assurance that we will obtain a patent or patents broad enough in scope to have value  or obtain a patent at all 
we have registered copyright rights in our easylanguage dictionary and documentation and tradestation software 
we have obtained trademark registrations for the tradestation mark in the united states  australia  canada  the european union  indonesia  korea  singapore  south africa and taiwan 
we have obtained registrations for the optionstation mark in the united states  canada and the european union 
we have obtained registrations in the united states for the marks activitybar  easylanguage  positiongraphs  powereditor  probabilitymap  prosuite  radarscreen  test before you trade and other marks 
we use an online subscription agreement for our internet trading software and data services between tradestation technologies and each of the users whether the users are brokerage customers or monthly subscribers in order to protect our copyrights and trade secrets and to prevent such users from commercially exploiting such copyrights and trade secrets for their own gain 
since these licenses are not physically signed by the licensees  it is possible their enforceability is limited under certain state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties copy or otherwise obtain  use or exploit our software or technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our software technology is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software technology exists 
piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
in addition  effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries  including some in which we may attempt to expand sales efforts 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
we do not believe that we are infringing  or that any technology in development will infringe  the intellectual property rights of others 
however  there can be no assurance that infringement claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is currently an infringement case pending against tradestation securities and eight other online brokerage firms which  even though it appears to us to be baseless  could result in substantial ongoing litigation costs and have materially adverse consequences 
see item legal proceedings 
to the extent that we acquire or license a portion of the software or data included in our products or services from third parties some data is licensed from third parties  or market products licensed from others generally  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such acquired or licensed software or data technology 
software patent infringement cases in financial service industries are becoming more frequent  and we may be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
in the future  litigation in addition to the pending 
table of contents infringement case will likely be necessary to establish  define  enforce  defend and protect patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation would likely be costly and divert management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  which could be expensive  or prevent us from selling our products or services or using our trademarks  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation our brokerage subsidiary  tradestation securities  is subject to extensive securities and futures industry regulation under both federal and state laws as a broker dealer with respect to its equities and equities options business and as a futures commission merchant with respect to its futures and forex business 
broker dealers and futures commission merchants are subject to regulations covering all aspects of those businesses  including sales methods  trade practices  use and safe keeping of customers funds and securities  clearing  processing and settlement of trades  and arrangements with clearing houses  exchanges and clearing corporations  capital structure  cash deposit or escrow requirements or their equivalent  record keeping  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision 
to the extent tradestation securities solicits orders from customers or makes investment recommendations  it is subject to additional rules and regulations governing  among other things  sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to its customers 
tradestation securities mode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by additional legislation  changes in rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec  the national association of securities dealers nasd  the commodity futures trading commission cftc  the national futures association nfa  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the depository trust clearing corporation and national securities clearing corporation dtcc nscc  the options clearing corporation occ  various stock and futures exchanges  and other self regulatory associations and organizations  and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and laws  particularly any changes focused on online brokerages that target an active trader customer base 
with respect to active trading  the nasd has adopted rules that require firms to provide customers with a risk disclosure statement about active trading 
further  the nasd and nyse s margin rules impose more restrictive requirements for pattern active traders we are subject to the nasd definition and rules regarding pattern active trading 
governmental concern is focused in two basic areas that the customer has sufficient trading experience and that the customer has sufficient risk capital to engage in active trading 
a minimum equities account balance of  is required 
tradestation securities customer account documentation specifies that being a brokerage customer of tradestation securities is only for traders who have experience in active trading  are willing to risk considerable amounts of capital at least  and are interested in engaging in high risk  short term  speculative trading activity 
we believe our brokerage firm s minimum account opening requirements  as well as the extensive user education documentation and tutorials offered on our web site  are consistent with both the letter and the spirit of current rules and regulations concerning active trading 

table of contents the sec  the nasd  the cftc  the nfa and other self regulatory associations and organizations and state securities commissions can censure  fine  enjoin  suspend  expel or issue cease and desist orders to a broker dealer or futures commission merchant or any of its officers or employees 
marketing campaigns by tradestation securities to bring brand name recognition to its services and to promote the benefit of those services  such as the tradestation electronic trading platform and its various features  are regulated by the nasd and nfa  and all marketing materials must be reviewed by an appropriately licensed tradestation securities principal prior to release  and must conform to standards articulated by the sec  nasd and nfa 
the nasd or nfa may request that revisions be made to marketing materials  and can impose certain penalties for violations of its advertising regulations  including censures or fines  a requirement of advance regulatory approval of all advertising  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion of a broker dealer or futures commission merchant or any of its officers or employees 
the sec  the nasd  the cftc and the nfa and various other regulatory associations and organizations have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and futures commission merchants 
net capital is the net worth of the regulated company assets minus liabilities  less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it must cease conducting business and  if it does not do so  it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or the cftc and suspension or expulsion by the nasd or nfa  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
tradestation securities is registered as a broker dealer in every us state and the district of columbia  and is subject to regulation under the laws of those jurisdictions  including registration requirements and being subject to sanctions if a determination of misconduct is made 
tradestation securities is a member of the securities investor protection corporation sipc 
sipc provides protection of up to  for each equities account brokerage customer  subject to a limitation of  for cash balances  in the event of the financial failure of a broker dealer 
to the extent tradestation securities clears its equities brokerage transactions through bear  stearns securities corp  bear  stearns has obtained an excess securities bond issued by travelers casualty and surety company which provides additional protection for any loss of securities and or cash in excess of the primary sipc protection 
for equities brokerage accounts the custody and trade clearing of and for which are to be handled by tradestation securities  if and when that occurs  tradestation has obtained a commitment for an excess securities bond with hsbc insurance brokerage limited  an insurance company associated with lloyd s of london 
this excess coverage will provide protection for any loss of securities and or cash in excess of primary sipc protection  up to million in the aggregate 
based upon the asset size per account and in the aggregate of tradestation securities equities client base as of the date of this report  if tradestation securities were to self clear all equities trades for its active trader client base this excess sipc protection would  combined with primary sipc protection  be more than adequate to cover the loss of of those client assets in the very unlikely event that tradestation securities experienced financial failure and all client assets were somehow lost 
neither sipc nor excess sipc coverage applies to fluctuations in the 
table of contents market value of securities or any losses other than those directly caused by the financial failure of the broker dealer 
it is possible that other federal or state agencies will attempt to regulate our current and planned online and other electronic service activities with rules that may include compliance requirements relating to record keeping  data processing  other operation methods  privacy  pricing  content  and quality of goods and services as the market for online commerce evolves 
because of the growth in the electronic commerce market  congress had held hearings on whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
as a result  federal or state authorities could enact laws  rules or regulations  not only with respect to online brokerage services  but other online services we provide or may in the future provide 
such laws  rules and regulations  if and when enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
employees as of december   we had full time equivalent employees  consisting of in technology development  including software engineering  product management  user education and quality assurance  in sales and marketing relating to brokerage services  subscriptions and software products including in sales  on the trading desk  in financial operations  in client services and software support and in marketing and fulfillment  and in general and administrative  including executive management  finance  information technology services and human resources 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization  and we have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good 
our future success depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of our key senior management and technology development personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key personnel 
departures and additions of personnel  to the extent disruptive  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

factors that may cause or contribute to such differences  and our business risks and uncertainties generally  include  but are not limited to  the items described below  as well as those described in other sections of this report  our other public filings and our press releases 

table of contents there are several factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which could result in significant volatility in our stock price quarterly revenues and operating results of tradestation group and its predecessor companies have fluctuated significantly in the past  and our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future 
causes of such significant fluctuations may include  but are not limited to the effect of an anticipated reversal  later in  of an income tax valuation allowance relating to net deferred income tax assets  which could generate one time income of more than million in the quarter the reversal is made  the effect  on the company s net income and earnings per share  of income tax expense at an effective rate of estimated to be applied beginning in the quarter following our reversal of the income tax valuation allowance which is significantly higher than the effective income tax rate over the last seven fiscal quarters  the timing ie  number and length of delays  success and other effects of our anticipated self clearing operations  or our inability to commence self clearing as a result of a failure to obtain final regulatory or other third party approvals or to satisfy conditions required to obtain a needed regulatory or other third party approval  the effect  in the event we decide that the commencement of self clearing operations will be delayed for a long period of time  or decide not to self clear  of the decisions we then make about clearing ie  whether to enter into an omnibus clearing arrangement or continue to use a fully disclosed clearing agent for each equities brokerage account  the effect of changes to our commission pricing or other fee structures since the second quarter we have continuously reduced commission pricing  and of additional price reductions that may be implemented in the future our most recent reduction to our commission pricing for equities and futures trades became effective november   market or competitive pressure to continue to lower commissions and fees charged to customers  the timing  success  volatility and other characteristics or effects that develop concerning our new forex and online options trade execution services  the appeal of our products and services to the institutional trader market given our limited experience selling to that market  and the cost of technology development and sales  marketing  compliance  technical  administrative and other infrastructure that may be required to improve our chance of success in the institutional trader market  general economic and market factors that affect active trading  including trade volume  market volatility  market direction  the level of confidence and trust in the markets  and seasonality summer months and holiday seasons typically being slower periods  pending or potential third party claims that turn out to be significantly more or less costly  in terms of both judgment or settlement amounts and legal expenses  than we currently estimate or expect  including  but not necessarily limited to  the three claims filed in by the co founders of the predecessor company to tradestation securities against the company  certain of its executive officers and directors and certain family partnerships owned by two of the executive officers which seek  in the aggregate  tens of

conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity our products and services are  and will continue to be  designed for customers who trade actively in the securities and financial markets 
there has been  since mid year  and  despite improved conditions in there may continue to be  unfavorable conditions in the securities and financial markets 
to the extent that interest in active trading decreases due to low trading volumes  lack of volatility  or significant downward movement in the securities or financial markets  such as has recently occurred  or future tax law changes  recessions  depressions  wars  terrorism including cyberterrorism  or otherwise  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 
unfavorable market conditions have  historically  seemed to severely negatively impact the share price of publicly held online brokerage firms  and also may result in more losses for our clients  which could result in increases in quantity and size of errors or omissions claims that may be made against us by clients 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of those potential claims 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 

table of contents we may need to make decisions about when or if we will begin self clearing equity trades for active trader accounts we have planned for some time to begin self clearing equities trades for our active trader accounts as soon as possible in currently  all of our clients equities trades are cleared through bear stearns  our clearing agent 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain all of the approvals and memberships required to conduct self clearing operations as a broker dealer 
there is also a significant risk that we will encounter substantial delays in launching self clearing operations due to difficulties in satisfying conditions or requirements attached to membership or approvals such as requirements regarding large financial or security deposits  or the requirement that we obtain further changes to our nasd membership agreement  or as a result of technical issues or other third party acts or failures to act outside of our control 
in fact  the depository trust clearing corporation national securities clearing corporation dtcc nscc has very recently expressed some concerns that need to be addressed before we will be considered for approval 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately commence self clearing operations for example  we may decide that an omnibus clearing arrangement is more suitable in the circumstances  or that continuing to use a fully disclosed clearing agent for the foreseeable future is the best decision 
if we do commence self clearing  or an omnibus clearing arrangement  we have no such experience  and the cost savings and efficiencies of self clearing or omnibus clearing  assuming either occurs  may be less favorable than we expect as a result of unanticipated increased fixed  infrastructure or incremental costs  mistakes or other factors 
also  such anticipated savings may be more than offset by account losses or reduced trading activity if any self clearing mistakes or failures occur which undermine our clients or prospects confidence in our ability to conduct reliable self clearing operations 
our industry is intensely competitive  which makes it difficult to attract and retain customers the markets for online brokerage services  trading software tools  and real time market data services are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there has been substantial consolidation of those three products and services occurring in the industry  as well as consolidation of the types of financial instruments equities  equities options  futures  forex offered by firms  and of online brokerage firms generally 
we believe that competition from large online and other large brokerage firms and smaller brokerage firms focused on active traders  as well as consolidation  will substantially increase and intensify in the future 
competition may be further intensified by the size of the active trader market  which is generally thought to be comprised of less than of all online brokerage accounts 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control 
factors outside of our control include price pressure  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by our competitors  market conditions  such as recession  the size of the active trader market today and in the future  the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use direct access brokerage services from firms that have traditionally served mostly retail clients  data availability and cost  and third party clearing costs 
factors over which we have more control  but which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties with respect to our ability to effectively compete  include timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements we develop  our ability to design  improve and support materially error free internet based systems  ease of use of our products and services  reliability of our products and services  pricing decisions  self clearing costs  and sales and other marketing decisions and efforts 

table of contents systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers the online electronic trading platform we provide to our clients is based upon the integration of our sophisticated front end software technology with our equally sophisticated  internet based server farm technology 
our server farm technology is the foundation upon which online trading clients receive real time market data and place buy and sell orders 
however  in order for this technology to provide a live  real time trading platform  it requires integration with real time market data  which are currently provided directly by the exchanges or by systems of independent third party market data vendors who obtain the data directly from the exchanges  the electronic order book systems of electronic communication networks ecns and electronic systems offered by the exchanges  the clearing and back office systems of the clearing firms we use  and the forex deal order placement  settlement and back office systems of or licensed by the forex dealer firm which is responsible for all of our client s forex trades 
accordingly  our ability to offer a platform that enables the development  testing and automation of trading strategies and the placement and execution of buy and sell orders depends heavily on the effectiveness  integrity  reliability and consistent performance of all of these systems and technologies 
in particular  the stress that is placed on these systems during peak trading times could cause one or more of these systems to operate too slowly or fail 
we have experienced several delays and outages since we launched our online trading platform  many of which related to data vendor  exchange  clearing firm  exchange and ecn outages or issues which are beyond our control 
also  a hardware or software failure  software design limitations or errors that exist in our and others technologies  power or telecommunications interruption or natural disaster could cause a systems failure or other potentially damaging results 
when systems in the trading process slow down significantly or fail  even for a short time  our brokerage customers could suffer delays in trading  or unintended results or other problems  potentially causing losses and possibly subjecting us to claims for such losses 
such failures or delays  depending upon how often they occur and how serious they are  could also result in our clients and client prospects losing or failing to gain confidence in our trading platform 
additionally  as a general matter not applicable only to our company  the integrity of these types of systems is increasingly being attacked by persons sometimes referred to as hackers who intentionally introduce viruses or other defects to cause damage  inaccuracies or complete failure 
also  cyberterrorism  should it occur  may significantly affect people s willingness to use internet based services  particularly ones that involve their personal or company s assets 
during a system outage or failure  our brokerage may be able to take orders by telephone  however  only associates with appropriate licenses  knowledge and experience can accept telephone orders  and an adequate number of associates likely would not be available to take customer calls in the event of a system outage or failure 
system delays  errors  outages and failures  depending upon how serious and how often they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 

table of contents the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers many aspects of the securities brokerage business  including online trading services  involve substantial risks of liability 
in recent years there has been an increasing incidence of litigation involving the securities brokerage industry  including class action and other suits that generally seek substantial damages  including in some cases punitive damages 
our proprietary order routing technology is designed to automatically locate  with immediacy  the best available price in the appropriate market in completing execution of a trade triggered by programmed market entry and exit rules 
there are risks that the electronic communications and other systems upon which these products and services rely  and will continue to rely  or our products and services themselves  as a result of flaws or other imperfections or limitations in their designs or performance  may operate too slowly  fail  cause confusion or uncertainty to the user  or operate or produce results not understood or intended by the user 
an investor or trader using either the full electronic trading platform or our subscription service might claim that investment or trading losses or lost profits resulted from use of a flawed version of one of our trading software tools or systems  or inaccurate assumptions made by the trading software tools regarding data  or inaccurate data 
major failures of this kind may affect all customers who are online simultaneously 
any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of the above described risks 
while our contracts with customers are  we believe  clear that customers who do business with us must knowingly assume all of the risks described above  there can be no assurance that a judge  arbitrator or regulator would enforce or honor such contractual provisions 
see conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity  and systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers above 
dependence upon outside data sources and clearing relationships creates risks outside of our control which may affect our ability to provide  and our cost to provide  market data and clearing and account services our business is currently dependent upon our ability to maintain contracts with private market and news data vendors and clearing and dealer firms in order to provide certain market data and news  and clearing and account services  respectively  to our customers 
we currently obtain new york stock exchange nyse  american stock exchange amex  nasdaq  options price reporting authority opra  chicago mercantile exchange cme  chicago board of trade cbot and onechicago real time market data directly from those exchanges  but obtain other market data such as forex data and data of smaller futures exchanges and news pursuant to non exclusive licenses from private data vendors who in turn obtain the data from exchanges or other sources 
clearing and back office account services for our brokerage clients are obtained from established brokerage clearing firms 
for our forex services  we rely on a third party forex dealer firm for all trade activity account services 
the data and news contracts typically provide for royalties based on usage or minimums  the clearing contracts provide for transactional clearing fees and charges  and the contract with our forex dealer provides for sharing a fixed amount of the spread made by the forex dealer firm in each deal 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or maintain contracts or acceptable clearing cost or vendor fee rates 
in fact  in we needed to quickly change our futures clearing firm in response to a substantial increase in our clearing costs imposed by our former futures clearing 
table of contents firm 
we have also decided  due principally to clearing cost considerations  to begin self clearing active trader equities accounts as soon as possible in changes or  in some cases  failure or inability to make changes in our relationships with one or more of these third parties  or involuntary termination of one of more of those relationships  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we are subject to intellectual property litigation there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
although we do not believe that we are or will be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  there has been an infringement claim asserted against us and eight other online brokerage firms by a company named datamize  inc which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects if it is successful 
such a case  as well as any other infringement case that may be brought against us  could result in our being unable to use intellectual property which is integral to one or more of our products or services 
while we believe datamize  inc s claim is meritless  no assurances can be made about the outcome of this litigation or the magnitude of the cost to defend the claims made in this litigation 
we may not be able to adequately protect or preserve our rights in intellectual property our success is and will continue to be heavily dependent on proprietary technology  including existing trading software  internet  web site and order execution technology  and those types of technology currently in development 
we view our technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we also have a pending patent application covering the tradestation electronic platform  but we do not yet know if the patent will be issued 
policing unauthorized use of our products and services is difficult  however  and we may be unable to prevent  or unsuccessful in attempts to prevent  theft  copying or other unauthorized use or exploitation of our product and service technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect or defend our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies or products and services 
we may need cash in the foreseeable future while we anticipate having sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next months  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the rate of customer acceptance of our products and services  including the number of new brokerage accounts acquired and the number and volume of trades made by our brokerage customers  our recent price reduction  price competition that may result in our continuing to charge lower commissions and fees to customers  significant  increased infrastructure costs as our business grows  including unanticipated costs for self clearing and or omnibus clearing operations such as large cash or security deposits  unanticipated costs relating to our new forex and options execution services  costs of technology development and sales  marketing  compliance  technical and administrative operations relating to increased and intensified pursuit of institutional clients  substantial legal costs and or unexpected unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits and arbitrations currently pending against us  and competing technological and market developments 
funds  if and when needed  may be raised through debt financing and or the issuance of equity securities  
table of contents there being no assurance that any such type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur 
any equity financing or debt financing which requires issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender would reduce the percentage ownership of the shareholders of the company 
shareholders also may  if issuance of equities occurs  experience additional dilution in net book value per share  or the issued equities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders 
operation in a highly regulated industry and compliance failures may result in severe penalties and other harmful governmental actions against us the securities and commodity futures industries are subject to extensive regulation covering all aspects of those businesses 
regulation of forex dealer and brokerage services is increasing as well 
the various governmental authorities and industry self regulatory organizations that supervise and regulate and may soon supervise and regulate our brokerage firm have broad enforcement powers to censure  fine  suspend  enjoin  expel or issue cease and desist orders to our brokerage firm or any of its officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations 
additionally  rules relating specifically to active traders have been enacted and more may be enacted which severely limit the operations and potential success of our business 
our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our brokerage s maintenance of compliance and reporting systems  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other personnel 
our brokerage could be subject to disciplinary or other regulatory or legal actions in the future due to noncompliance 
the loss of key employees could decrease the quality of our management and operations our success depends to a very significant extent on the continued availability and performance of a number of senior management and product development personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our company 
there are risks relating to our ability to maintain customer privacy and security and that increased government regulation of internet business may occur customers may refuse to transact business over the internet  particularly business  such as ours  that involves the handling of significant amounts of customers funds  due to privacy or security concerns 
this risk will grow if  as and to the extent cyberterrorism occurs or is perceived to be a viable  prominent threat or likelihood to occur 
we currently incorporate and plan to continue to incorporate security measures into our privacy policies 
however  a major breach of customer privacy or security could have serious consequences for our internet based operations 
use of the internet  particularly for commercial transactions  may not continue to increase as rapidly as it has during the past few years as a result of privacy or security concerns  or for other reasons 
if this occurs  the growth of our operations would be materially hindered 
if internet activity becomes heavily regulated in these respects or otherwise  that could also have significant negative consequences for the growth of our current and planned operations 

table of contents our brokerage must meet net capital requirements as a broker dealer that  if not satisfied  could result in severe penalties  and which at all times limit our right to use all of the brokerage s cash the sec  the nasd  the nfa and other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and futures commission merchants 
net capital is the net worth of the regulated company assets minus liabilities  less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or cftc and suspension or expulsion by the nasd or nfa  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
if such net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the use of capital would be limited 
also  our ability to withdraw capital from our tradestation securities brokerage subsidiary is subject to sec rules  which in turn could materially impact our available working capital and materially impact or limit our ability to repay debt as and when due  redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock  if required or desirable  and pay dividends in the future 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our then present levels of business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see we may need cash in the foreseeable future above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and the interest earned from interest revenue sharing arrangements with our clearing firms 
in order to reduce this interest rate risk  we are currently invested in investments with short maturities 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market funds  overnight investments  us treasury bills and obligations of a us government agency 
the interest earned on those investments is relatively low based upon current market interest rates 
a significant increase in interest rates would have a positive impact on our financial results 
any decrease in those rates would not have a material impact on our financial results
