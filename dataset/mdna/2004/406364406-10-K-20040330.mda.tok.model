item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview real estate 
fee income from real estate operations has trended downward in recent years due to a decline in leasing fees and construction supervisory fees  but has historically fluctuated depending upon an occasional spike in lease fees due to the execution of a large lease or development fee due to completion of a major project 
correspondingly  during the same period expenses have also trended downward  except for the litigation expense in and income from operations  excluding the litigation expense  was   and  respectively  for the three years ended december  future income and cash flows are largely dependent on the leasing  development and management activities of the company s subsidiaries on behalf of hrp 
as discussed in note  the company continues to face litigation risk related to its real estate operations 
an adverse ruling could impact the company s general partner and limited partner ownership interests in hrp and disrupt the company s income and cash flow stream 
during  hrp s business was not significantly adversely impacted by the downturn in the economy as a whole  primarily due to increased rentals resulting from a newly constructed five story office building in atlanta  georgia 
however  there was a decline in the average occupancy rate of approximately during  and the downturn in the economy and its resultant work force layoffs and business failures could lead to higher than normal vacancy rates in many markets 
that fact  coupled with uncertainty as to the timing of any economic recovery  could negatively impact the timing and the amount of revenues and profits generated from hrp s properties 
the company believes that this downturn in the economy could adversely impact hrp s business in textile products 
the company derives approximately of its revenues from the operations of its brookwood subsidiary  and  consequently  the company s success is highly dependent upon brookwood s success 
in the long run  brookwood s success will be influenced in varying degrees by its response to legislation and administrative actions restricting or liberalizing trade among world textile producing and consuming countries such as the north american free trade agreement nafta  the wto  the effectiveness of anti dumping and countervailing duty remedies and of enforcement activities by the us government  and the value of the united states dollar in relation to other currencies and world economic developments 
however  under nafta with mexico and canada  there are no textile and apparel quotas between the united states and either mexico or canada for products that meet certain origin criteria 
tariffs among the three countries are either already zero or are being phased out 
brookwood continues to identify new market niches to replace sales lost to importers 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has been developing advanced breathable  waterproof laminate materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer applications is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing enterprise value of brookwood is contingent on its ability to adapt to the global textile industry  however  there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained 
the textile products business is not interdependent with any of the company s other business operations 
the company does not guarantee the brookwood bank debt and is not obligated to contribute additional capital 
if the textile products business were to deteriorate  creditors could look only to brookwood s assets for the satisfaction of its obligations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in december  the sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition 
table of contents and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition fee income from real estate operations is recognized as the services eg management  leasing  acquisition  construction are performed in accordance with various service agreements 
the company records a non cash adjustment for the elimination of intercompany profits associated with leasing and construction supervision fees earned from hrp to the extent of their ownership interest in hrp 
such intercompany profits are deferred and amortized to income over the term of the related leases and the depreciable lives of property improvements as recorded by hrp 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title passes to the customer 
brookwood provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of brookwood s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
on occasion  brookwood receives instructions from some of its customers to finish fabric  invoice the full amount and hold the finished inventory until the customer sends shipping instructions 
in those cases  brookwood records the sale and sends the customer an invoice containing normal and usual payment terms and segregates the inventory from brookwood s inventory 
equity method of accounting the company accounts for its investments in hrp and hec using the equity method of accounting 
the company owns approximately of hrp and of hec as of december   respectively 
the equity method is used because the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of each entity 
the company records its pro rata share of each entity s net income loss adjusted for certain items  such as the elimination of intercompany profits  as well as a pro rata share of partners capital and stockholders equity transactions and comprehensive income loss 
impairment of long lived assets the company s management routinely reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for assets held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the investment  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes  future rental and occupancy rates  and the level of expected operating expenses 
inventories inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based on assumptions related to future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported

as a result of the fluctuations in the anticipated gain on the sale of the hrp limited partner units  the realization of a gain on the sale of former hallwood energy  and the projected income from operations  partially offset by the decline in value and disposition of the company s hotel properties  management has determined that the deferred tax asset should be adjusted to reflect the anticipated utilization of nols resulting from the expected income from these assumptions 
accordingly the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of  in and deferred tax expense of  in  and  in  respectively  which resulted in a deferred tax asset of  at december    at december  and  at december  the portion of the deferred tax expense benefit during the years ended december   and related to continuing operations was   and  respectively  and the portion relating to discontinued operations was   and  respectively 
the company recorded a federal current tax expense of   and  from continuing operations in the three years ended december   respectively  principally for the filing of separate returns of certain subsidiaries not included in the company s consolidated federal tax return

the company recorded state tax expense of  in   in and  in although the company reported significant taxable income in from continuing operations and hotel dispositions and in from the sale of its investment in former hallwood energy  it incurred no federal alternative minimum tax  due to a change in the tax law affecting the calculation of the alternative minimum tax that expired in the company s nols expire as follows   and to  sfas no 
requires that the tax benefit of such nols be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such nols to be more likely than not 
based upon the company s expectations and available tax planning strategies  management has determined that taxable income will more likely than not be sufficient to utilize approximately  of the nols prior to their ultimate expiration in the year management believes that the company has certain tax planning strategies available  which include the potential sale of certain real estate investments  that could be implemented  if necessary  to supplement income from operations to fully realize the net recorded tax benefits before their expiration 
management has considered such strategies in reaching its conclusion that  more likely than not  taxable income will be sufficient to utilize a portion of the nols before expiration  however  future levels of operating income and taxable gains are dependent upon general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for utilization of the nols 
management periodically reevaluates its tax planning strategies based upon changes in facts and circumstances and  accordingly  considers potential adjustments to the valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset 
although the use of such carryforwards could  under certain circumstances be limited  the company is presently unaware of the occurrence of any event which would result in such limitations 
in addition  utilization of nols in the future may be limited if changes in the company s stock ownership create a change of control  as provided in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended
