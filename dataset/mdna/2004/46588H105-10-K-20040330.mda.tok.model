sponsorship revenues are derived principally from contracts designed to support a customer s broad marketing objectives  including brand promotion  awareness  product introductions and online research 
sponsorship agreements typically include the delivery of impressions on our web sites and occasionally the design and development of customized sites that enhance the promotional objectives of the sponsor 
an impression is the viewing of promotional material on a web page  which may include rich media and display or banner advertisements  links  or other text or images 
as part of a few sponsorship agreements  sponsors selling products may provide us with a commission on sales of their products generated through our web sites 
to date  amounts received from the sale of sponsor s products have not been significant 
advertising revenues are derived principally from short term advertising contracts in which we typically guarantee a minimum number of impressions or pages to be delivered to users over a specified period of time for a fixed fee 
sponsorship and advertising revenues are recognized ratably in the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that we have no continuing obligations and the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  at the lesser of the ratio of impressions delivered over total guaranteed impressions or the straight line basis over the term of the contract 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed impressions are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
we also derive sponsorship and advertising revenues from sponsored links appearing on an ivillage web page that is based upon relevant content or a world wide web search query result 
these revenues are earned on a cost per thousand impressions and or a percentage of the advertiser s net revenue and are recognized upon notification from the search engine provider 
for contracts with multiple elements  namely those that include delivered and undelivered products  or advertising and production revenue  we allocate revenue to each element based on evidence of its fair value under the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  emerging issues task force issue  or eitf  no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf evidence of fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
we recognize revenue allocated to each element when the criteria for revenue set forth above are met 
barter revenues generally represent exchanges by us of advertising space on our web sites for reciprocal advertising space on or traffic from other web sites 
revenues and expenses from these barter transactions are recorded based upon the fair value of the advertisements delivered 
fair value of advertisements delivered is based upon our recent practice of receiving cash for similar advertisements 
barter revenues are recognized when the advertisements are displayed on ivillage 
com and its affiliated properties 
barter expenses are generally recognized when our advertisements are displayed on the reciprocal web sites or properties  which is typically in the same period as when advertisements are displayed on ivillage 
com and its affiliated properties  and are included as part of sales and marketing expenses

in recent years  ivpn has developed two new revenue streams 
ivpn began creating and distributing custom publications and mailings primarily on behalf of one advertiser

fixed assets and intangibles depreciation of equipment  furniture and fixtures  and computer software is provided for by the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided for over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement 
the cost of additions  and expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing assets  are capitalized  and repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred 
amortization of intangible assets are over the expected life of the related asset and range from one to ten in years 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas  regarding the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
we assess the recoverability of our fixed assets and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balance over the assets remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted forecasted cash flows 
if undiscounted forecasted cash flows indicate that the unamortized amounts will not be recovered  an adjustment will be made to reduce the net amounts to an amount consistent with forecasted future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated when estimating future discounted cash flows 
future cash flows are based on trends of historical performance and our estimate of future performances  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions 
goodwill goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair value is typically based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes by the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on this consideration  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the required amount of allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience  the review of the agings and analysis of specific customer accounts 
management estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates and assumptions made by us include those related to the useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets  the recoverability of fixed assets  goodwill  intangible assets and deferred tax assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the assessment of expected probable losses if any of claims and potential claims 
results of operations in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  segment information is being reported consistent with our method of internal reporting 
in accordance with sfas  operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
we are organized primarily by subsidiaries and divisions 
our subsidiaries and divisions have no operating managers that report to the chief operating decision maker and the chief operating decision maker reviews results of operations at the highest level of aggregate data in making decisions 
the chief operating decision maker does review revenue results of subsidiaries and divisions 
our discussion of revenue has been organized into separate subsidiaries and divisions  however operating expenses and results of operations are discussed on a combined basis 
we believe the following factors may contribute to the variability of our results of operations from period to period o the loss of a contract from a major customer  o the timing of our recognition of revenue  o the volatility of the online advertising market  o an interruption or malfunction in service from our primary third party service providers  o the date of commencement of a sponsorship and advertising campaign  and o the date of completion of printing and or distribution of a custom publication or magazine

 released by the sec  requires all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
other than agreements that contingently require us to indemnify counter parties against third party claims  we currently do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents include money market accounts 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and at times these balances exceed insurable amounts 
net cash used in operating activities decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended the overall decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the comparable period in was primarily from o a larger utilization of restricted cash and other assets in of approximately million  primarily due to the surrender of restricted cash to the landlord in consideration of our lease renegotiation  and o a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses in of approximately million compared to an increase of million in  primarily from liabilities paid in resulting from the women

we have sustained net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
our ability to meet our obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent upon our ability to achieve profitable operations and or raise additional financing through public or private equity financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources  through the launch of new subscription or other revenue generating initiatives or other sources of financing to fund operations 
due primarily to our lack of historical profitability  it is unlikely that we would be able to obtain bank financing 
management believes that our current funds will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned expenditures through the next twelve months 
if anticipated operating results are not achieved  management believes it has the ability to delay or reduce expenditures  so as not to require additional financial resources  although there can be no assurances in this regard 
if we need to raise funds through a public offering or private placement of our securities  funds may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
management believes that we will be able to achieve profitability on a fiscal year basis in and achieve net income by growing revenues in as compared to  while holding expenses relatively unchanged year over year 
we may not achieve profitable operations 
factors that could affect our ability to achieve profitable operations on a fiscal year basis include the loss of any of our major customers  including hearst  or a significant downturn in the advertising market or economy  in general  as well as our ability to report increased revenues on a year over year basis 
we have recently commenced discussions regarding the renewal of the amended and restated magazine content license and hosting agreement with hearst that expires in june but will continue afterwards on a month to month basis unless terminated by either party with days prior notice 
however  we cannot assure whether this contract will be renewed and  if renewed  whether the renewal terms will be as favorable as the current agreement with hearst 
ivpn currently broadcasts the channels to its hospitals via a hour  days a week satellite broadcast 
this satellite is scheduled to go offline in upon the expiration of the contract or in the event of an unforeseen earlier interruption of service  we would need to either renegotiate a new contract  find another satellite provider  and or invest in alternative technology to distribute the service 
ivpn is in the process of converting many of its hospitals from the satellite broadcast to a new system that eliminates the need for a constant satellite feed 
this new technology will only require a limited amount of satellite time each month resulting in reduced operating costs in in  ivpn initiated the collection of an annual fee to receive the channels 
these fees result from agreements between ivpn and the hospitals that  on average  have a life between three to five years 
as of february   approximately of participating hospitals have agreed to pay this fee  however  we can make no assurance that all of the hospitals will agree to pay a fee 
ivpn estimates that it will cost approximately million to million to convert to the new technology 
we expect that the fees to be received from the hospitals will cover the cost of the conversion to the new technology 
our february advertising agreement with unilever  as amended  provided for a unilever advertising purchase commitment of million 
this agreement expired in june in october  we entered into a new agreement with unilever that terminates the february advertising agreement and provides for unilever s purchase of an additional million in advertising and receipt of the remaining advertising not received under the previous agreement of approximately million 
the new agreement expires in december and approximately million remains to be earned 
pursuant to the amended and restated magazine content license and hosting agreement with hearst  hearst committed to purchase from us between approximately million and million of production and advertising services over a three year period beginning in june this agreement also provides for revenue sharing between hearst and us with respect to advertising revenues obtained by us from the hearst magazine web sites and our other web sites containing substantial hearst content 
this revenue sharing arrangement requires that we pay hearst a royalty payment  based on net advertising revenues  of at least approximately million during the three year term of the agreement 
this amount would be reduced on a pro rata basis if hearst fails to expend its stated annual minimum in production fees in any year of the agreement 
in addition  if a shortfall in production fees occurs in any year of the agreement  then hearst must place additional advertising in an amount equal to of the production fee shortfall 
in march  we restructured the terms of our joint venture so that tesco purchased our entire ownership interest in ivillage uk 
we also entered into a twenty year agreement with tesco  subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events  whereby we will license to ivillage uk certain of our content and intellectual property  including trademarks and copyrights  for use in the uk and ireland in exchange for the greater of a minimum monthly license fee or a percentage of ivillage uk s gross revenues 
we will receive a minimum of million in year one of the license agreement  which will be earned monthly as services are provided 
as of december   we have received approximately million 
in july  we acquired the web site  trademarks  key contracts and other related assets of gurl 
com for an immaterial amount of cash 
in october  we exercised our call option and purchased unilever s remaining ownership interest in cbv in exchange for approximately million of cash and  shares of common stock in ivillage inc in december  we signed a web site services agreement in which hearst will pay approximately million for maintenance and hosting services for three teen sites seventeen 
com  cosmogirl 
com and teen 
com 
the agreement terminates in december we lease office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through april in addition  in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with various service providers for ad serving  satellite transmissions and license content arrangements 
the following is a schedule of future minimum non cancelable contractual obligations and the affect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods as of december  in thousands total less than year years years thereafter non cancelable operating leases      purchase obligations    total contractual obligations      in july  we entered into a lease amendment with the landlord of our new york headquarters that became effective on august  the lease amendment provides for a reduction in leased space  as well as a reduction in rent per square foot  resulting in anticipated cash savings in excess of million over the remaining term of the lease 
in connection with the lease amendment  we surrendered the approximately million classified as restricted cash to the landlord  and the landlord paid us million for certain other construction expenses that remained due from the landlord 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including o market acceptance of our services  o the amount of resources we devote to investments in our business  including entering into joint ventures with and or the acquisition of other entities  o the resources we devote to marketing  o the resources we devote to building the infrastructure necessary to enable us to sell subscription based products and services  and o the resources we devote to selling our products and services 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that contingently require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with advertisers and sponsors  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  agreements with customers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to use of their property  agreements with licensees or licensors  under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property  and agreements with initial purchasers and underwriters of our securities  under which we indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these indemnifications to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no related liabilities are recorded as of december  we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain indemnifications and  historically  we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these obligations 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  which requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority voting interest 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risks and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
based on review of fin  we do not believe we have any interests qualifying as variable interest entities and do not anticipate that the provisions of fin will have any near term impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable entities  or fin r 
fin r replaces the same titled fin that was issued in january fin r requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by a company that bears the majority of risk of loss from the variable entity s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns or both 
the provisions of this interpretation are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which amends sfas for certain decisions made by the fasb derivatives implementation group 
in particular  sfas clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to language used in fin  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after september   and for hedging relationships designated after september  in addition  most provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively 
our adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas  which requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  our adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued securities accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  which supercedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers  or faq  issues with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab adoption of sab was required immediately and did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
legal proceedings in january a belgian court issued a judgment against women 
com in the amount of approximately  euros  or approximately million based on the euro exchange rate as of december   relating to a claim by euregio 
net of copyright infringement 
we are appealing the judgment in the belgian court system  and we have been advised by outside counsel that euregio 
net would have to commence legal proceedings in the united states in order to enforce any judgment by a belgian court 
ivillage and women 
com are also defendants in class action lawsuits in federal court relating to each company s initial public offering 
in june  parties agreed in principle to settle the matter  along with similar lawsuits against more than other issuers 
we believe  based upon the advice of outside legal counsel  that the aforementioned lawsuits and claims asserted against us and our subsidiary pursuant to these complaints are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
if we lose our appeal of the judgment in the belgian case or if the proposed settlement in the initial public offering laddering cases is ultimately not approved by the courts  defending against these claims could require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  which could harm our business 
we are not currently subject to any other material legal proceedings 
we may from time to time  however  become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
risk factors we operate in an environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results and financial position could be harmed 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
risks related to our business we have an extremely limited history of net income on a quarterly basis and a history of losses on an annual basis  and may have further continuing losses 
we have incurred significant operating losses on an annual basis in each year of our operations and may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we achieved net income for the first time in the fourth quarter of  we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase net income on a quarterly or annual basis 
if our revenues grow slower than we anticipate  or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  we will continue to suffer substantial losses 
our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results are not indicative of future performance  are difficult to forecast and have been and are likely to continue to fluctuate 
we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as reliable indicators of future performance 
this makes it difficult to forecast with certainty quarterly and annual revenues and results of operations 
in addition  our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from fiscal quarter to quarter  and year to year  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside our control  and any of which could materially harm our business 
some of these factors include o fluctuations in the demand o fluctuations in marketing for advertising or electronic expenses and technology commerce infrastructure costs o the unpredictability of our o changes in the level of success in new revenue traffic on our network of and cost reduction initiatives web sites o bankruptcies or other payment o volatility in the media defaults of companies that are market a source of revenues our revenues for the foreseeable future will remain primarily dependent on user traffic levels and advertising activity on our web sites and  as a result  are difficult to forecast 
in addition  the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor may be lengthy  especially for larger  higher rate contracts  and is subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including o advertisers and sponsors o advertisers and sponsors budgetary constraints internal reviews o the possibility of cancellation o the success and continued or delay of projects by advertisers internal support of or sponsors advertisers and sponsors own development efforts we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected reduction in revenues in a particular fiscal quarter or year  which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we have a small number of major customers and the loss of any number of these customers could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on revenues from a small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of even a small number of our largest customers at any one time would significantly reduce our revenue  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in  and o in  hearst  a related party  accounted for approximately of total revenues  o in  procter and gamble accounted for approximately  of total revenues  hearst for approximately and unilever for approximately  and o in  unilever accounted for approximately of total revenues 
at december   hearst accounted for approximately of the net accounts receivable  and at december   procter and gamble accounted for approximately of the net accounts receivable 
our contract with procter gamble expired in june  our contract with hearst expires in june  and our contract with unilever  signed in october  expires in december although procter gamble continues to advertise with us and we have recently commenced discussions with hearst  we cannot  however  assure whether our contracts with our major customers will be renewed upon terms at least as favorable as existing agreements  or at all 
because our largest customers have varied over time in the past  we anticipate that they will continue to do so in the future 
our business is highly dependent upon user traffic 
our business is inherently dependent upon high user traffic levels 
the rates we charge to advertisers and sponsors and the number of products and services we sell are directly related to the number of users to ivillage s web sites 
user traffic from certain web sites that are non proprietary to ivillage are sometimes included in the reported information regarding our network of web sites 
these properties include the hearst magazine web sites and other parties who have agreed by contract to have traffic from their web sites incorporated within our network 
the number of users to our web sites may decline 
in addition  hearst or other third parties may discontinue allowing us to include their web sites as part of our network for traffic reporting purposes 
any decline in user traffic levels may cause our revenues to decrease and could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot maintain the popularity of our web site offerings among internet users  our business will fail 
we will be successful only if a critical mass of internet users  especially among women  continue to view our web sites as popular destinations on the internet 
it is difficult to predict the rate at which users will sample our offerings and the extent to which they will become members and or return users 
even in the case of repeat users  it is difficult to know whether they return to our web sites because they are satisfied with our offerings or because they are dissatisfied with the alternatives 
at any time  users of our services might revert to other offerings 
we cannot assure you that widespread use and acceptance of our offerings will occur 
if we cannot maintain the popularity of our offerings among internet users  our current business plan will fail 
we rely on third parties to provide reliable software  systems and related services 
we depend on various third parties for software  systems and related services  including saavis  verio  google  doubleclick  tacoda and prospero 
if for any reason one or more of these service providers becomes unable or unwilling to continue to provide services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our ability to deliver our product and service offerings to our advertisers  sponsors and users could be severely impaired 
we would have to identify and qualify substitute service providers  which could be time consuming and difficult and could result in unforeseen operational difficulties 
although we are confident that alternative service providers are available we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such services on as favorable terms or in a timely manner 
we rely on third parties to adequately measure the demographics of our user base 
it is important to our advertisers that we accurately measure the demographics of our user base and the delivery of advertisements on our web sites 
we depend on third parties to provide many of these measurement services  and to do so accurately and reliably 
if these third parties are unable or unwilling to provide these services to us in the future  we would need to perform them ourselves or obtain them from another provider 
this could cause us to incur additional costs or cause interruptions in our business until these services are replaced 
companies may choose not to advertise on our web sites or may pay us less for our sponsorship or advertising if they perceive our demographic measurements as not reliable 
our operation of ivpn poses a number of risks that could materially adversely affect our business strategy 
there are a number of risks in operating ivpn related to lamaze publishing  baby steps magazine and the channels  which are all primarily non internet businesses  including o the competitiveness of the o our ability to continue to media  television and commercialize and protect the publishing industries lamaze mark o our ability to maintain and o our ability to sell advertising market the lamaze 
com web and sponsorships on our site web sites o our ability to sell advertising o our ability to identify and and sponsorships on ivpn s predict trends in a timely magazines  videos and the manner that may impact consumer channels tastes in baby related information ivpn s and parenting related channels  and health related information on the wellness channel our failure to perform the functions required for the operation of ivpn in an efficient and timely manner could result in a disruption of ivpn s operations that could result is a loss of revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business strategy 
our business would be harmed if transmission of the channels were interrupted 
there is a risk that the satellite or the in hospital delivery system which transmit the channels may malfunction  which would result in an interruption of broadcasts 
extreme adverse weather conditions or third parties could damage or disable receivers and transmitters on the ground hindering transmission of the channels signal 
in either of these events occur  there may be a period of time before transmission of all or some of the channels could resume 
any interruption in our ability to transmit the channels could jeopardize our viewer base which could negatively impact our revenues related to the channels 
our principal investors investments in our competitors may result in conflicts of interest that could harm our business 
our principal investors  such as hearst  rho capital partners  inc and aol time warner inc  may have conflicts of interests by virtue of their own businesses  as in the case of aol and hearst  or investments in other companies that may compete with us 
these investments may result in a conflict of interest for our principal investors or result in the diversion of attractive business opportunities from our principal investors to other companies 
we are unable to determine all of the competing investments held by these principal investors 
in addition  we do not have the ability to constrain the investment activity of any of our principal investors and therefore cannot predict the extent of any future investments in businesses that are competitive with us 
restrictions on our ability to enter into sponsorship  advertising or other business relationships with hearst s competitors may adversely affect our business 
our amended and restated magazine content license and hosting agreement with hearst restricts our ability to enter into relationships with competitors of hearst and those restrictions may prevent us from expanding our network and enhancing our content and the visibility of our brand  and may cause us to forego potential advertising revenues from competitors of hearst 
specifically  the agreement provides that we may not  without hearst s consent o enter into any agreement to o display on an our web page the include in our network any web brands  logos  trademarks or sites for magazines that proprietary content of both compete with hearst magazines hearst and a hearst competitor o display on the hearst magazine web sites any advertising or other promotional materials from magazines that compete with hearst magazines we may not be able to expand our business through acquisitions and joint ventures and  even if we are successful  our operations may be adversely affected as a result of an acquisition or joint venture 
our business strategy includes growth through business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to implement this business strategy 
our ability to implement this business strategy depends in large part on our ability to compete successfully with other entities for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners 
factors affecting our ability to compete successfully in this regard include o our financial condition o our ability to obtain additional relative to the financial financing from investors condition of our competitors o the attractiveness of our common stock as potential consideration for entering into these types of transactions as compared to the common stock of other entities competing for these opportunities many of the entities with which we compete for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  our ability to fund acquisitions has been materially adversely affected by the overall decline in the market price of our common stock over the last several years 
if  despite these factors  we are successful in entering into additional business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to integrate the operations of the acquired companies or joint ventures 
our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired companies or joint ventures will depend  in part  on our ability to overcome or address o the difficulties of o the need to incorporate assimilating the operations successfully the acquired or and personnel of the shared technology or content acquired companies and the and rights into our potential disruption of our products  services and media ongoing business properties o the difficulties of o the potential impairment of establishing a new joint relationships with employees venture  including the need and customers as a result of to attract and retain any integration of new qualified personnel and the management personnel or need to attract customers reduction of personnel and advertisers o the difficulties of maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies in addition  completing acquisitions could require use of a significant amount of our available cash 
furthermore  we may have to issue equity or equity linked securities to pay for future acquisitions  and any of these issuances could be dilutive to existing and future stockholders 
acquisitions and investments may also have negative effects on our reported results of operations due to acquisition related charges  amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles  and or potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses or joint ventures 
any of these acquisition related risks or costs could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to maintain effective internal financial and managerial systems  controls and procedures  our results of operations may be harmed 
in the past  we have sought cost reductions through increased managerial efficiencies and expense reduction initiatives  including targeted staff reductions 
these reductions in workforce placed a significant strain on our managerial staff  financial controls and operational resources as our employees have assumed greater responsibilities and learned to manage their increased workload with reduced resources 
we continue to evaluate our operational and financial systems and our managerial controls and procedures to determine what additional changes  if any  might help us to manage our current operations better 
we face the risk that our systems  procedures and controls might not be adequate to support our operations or to maintain accountability for our assets 
any such failure could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our industry the operating performance of computer systems and web servers is critical to our business and reputation 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  due to a computer virus or otherwise  that causes an interruption in our internet offerings could result in reduced traffic on our web sites and reduced revenues for our business 
substantially all of our communications hardware and some of our other computer hardware operations are located at saavis facilities in new jersey and verio s facilities in california 
fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems 
we do not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal disaster recovery plan 
in addition  our web sites could also be affected by computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems  such as those historically experienced by several leading web sites 
if we experience outages or degraded service  user satisfaction would decrease  we would likely lose advertising revenue and our reputation and brands could be permanently harmed 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems 
in addition  we cannot assure you that saavis  which purchased the assets of cable and wireless and exodus communications  both of which had filed for bankruptcy protection  and verio  will be able to provide sufficient services for us or that we would be able to engage satisfactory alternative service providers 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web sites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
there is intense competition among media companies focused on women  and this competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are a large number of web sites competing for the attention and spending of members  users and advertisers 
our web sites compete for members  users and advertisers with the following types of companies o online services or web sites o publishers and distributors targeted at women  such as of traditional media  such oxygen 
com and lifetime 
com as television  radio and print o cable networks targeting women  such as oxygen media  o e commerce and companies inc  women s entertainment such as amazon 
com  inc 
network and lifetime television o web search and retrieval and other online service companies  commonly referred to as portals  such as aol  microsoft corporation s msn service and yahoo inc lamaze publishing s magazines directly compete with publishers of pre and post natal publications such as gruner and jahr  primedia and time inc these publishers have substantially greater marketing  research and financial resources than lamaze publishing 
increased competition may result in less advertising in lamaze publishing s magazines and a decline in lamaze publishing s advertising rates  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the internet fails to gain further acceptance as a medium for advertising  we would have slower revenue growth than expected and would incur greater than expected losses 
we compete with traditional advertising media  including television  radio and print  along with other high traffic web sites  for sponsorships and advertising expenditures 
although there are currently several standards to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising  the industry has had difficulty convincing potential advertisers that internet advertising is a significant advertising medium 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have historically relied on traditional forms of advertising may be reluctant or slow to adopt online advertising 
in addition  advertisers and advertising agencies that use the internet as an advertising medium may find online advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services than traditional advertising media 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have invested substantial resources in traditional methods of advertising may also be reluctant to reallocate their resources to online advertising 
moreover  software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to an internet user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of internet advertising 
if the markets for online advertising fails to develop or develop more slowly than we expects  or if we are unable to adapt to new forms of internet advertising  we would have slower than expected revenue growth and would incur greater than expected losses  and our business and financial condition would be harmed 
web based business models are still evolving 
a decrease in revenues relating to changes in internet advertising pricing models or inability to convert users to purchasers of our products and services  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet  including models based on the number of impressions delivered  numbers of click throughs by users or number of key words to which an advertisement is linked 
it is difficult to predict which  if any  of the models will emerge as the industry standard 
this uncertainty makes it difficult to project our long term advertising rates and revenues 
furthermore  consumer reluctance to subscribe to or pay for internet content may limit our ability to supplement internet advertising as our most significant source of revenue in the foreseeable future 
inability to supplement our advertising revenues could limit our growth and harm our business 
we may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in our industry 
our product and service offerings compete in a market characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent innovations and evolving industry standards 
for example o due to the increased speeds of alternative internet services connections  such as broadband services like dsl and cable technologies  the demand for such alternatives and the associated streaming and rich media content has rapidly increased 
as a result  the demand for dial up internet connections  like those offered by ivillageaccess  has decreased  and o a growing number of individuals access the internet through devices other than personal computers  such as cell phones  personal digital assistants  or television set top devices 
the low resolution  functionality and memory currently associated with some of these alternative devices might prevent or impede users from accessing our graphics rich web sites 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of our offerings 
we could incur substantial costs to modify our services or infrastructure to adapt to the changing technology environment 
notably  we continue to offer ivillage access as a dial up internet service offering  while the current industry and consumer trend is to migrate to a broadband service 
our failure to react to such technological change could contribute to a failure to obtain market share or the migration of current users to alternate service providers 
if we fail to attract and retain key personnel  our business would be materially adversely affected 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly douglas w 
mccormick  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
mccormick s current employment agreement expires in may the loss of the services of mr 
mccormick would likely harm our business 
we currently do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our senior management 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications as a result of our financial condition and relatively low common stock price 
as a result  we have in the past and may in the future incur increased salary and benefit costs 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel  our business  and our ability to develop and execute on our business strategies  will be materially harmed 
we are subject to legal proceedings that could result in liability and damage to our business 
from time to time  we have been  and expect to continue to be  subject to legal proceedings that individually  or in the aggregate  could harm our business 
o a belgian court issued a judgment against women 
com  relating to alleged copyright infringements  in the amount of approximately  euros approximately million based on the euro exchange rate as of december  in january the continuing defense of this action could involve significant legal expense  diversion of management attention and  ultimately  we may be required to pay the judgment awarded by the belgian court 
o several plaintiffs have filed class action lawsuits in federal court against us  several of our former executives  and our underwriters in connection with our march initial public offering 
a similar class action lawsuit was filed against women 
com  several of our former executives and women 
com s underwriters in connection with women 
com s october initial public offering 
in june  the parties agreed in principle to settle the matter  along with similar lawsuits against more than other issuers 
if the proposed settlement is ultimately not approved by the courts  even if these claims are not meritorious  defending against them could require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  which could harm our business 
possible infringement by third parties of our intellectual property rights  could harm our business 
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could entail significant expense and could prove difficult or impossible 
any infringement or misappropriation by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results 
furthermore  we has invested resources in acquiring domain names for existing and potential future use 
we cannot guarantee that we will be entitled to use these domain names under applicable trademark and similar laws or that other desired domain names will be available 
government regulation could add additional costs to doing business in the vitamin  mineral and supplement industry 
the manufacturing  processing  formulating  packaging  labeling and advertising of the ivillagesolutions products are subject to regulation by federal agencies  including the federal drug administration  the federal trade commission  the united states department of agriculture and the environmental protection agency 
these activities may also be regulated by various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries to which ivillagesolutions products may be distributed 
we cannot o assure that existing laws and regulations have been properly interpreted and applied to the ivillagesolutions products  o predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations or applications  or o determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on the manufacture  sale and distribution of ivillagesolutions products 
changes in current laws or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling 
regulatory compliance could limit the market for ivillagesolutions products  resulting in potential reductions in revenues or  if we fail to properly comply  potential legal liability 
we may face potential products liability based upon our ivillagesolutions products 
as with other retailers  distributors and manufacturers of products that are ingested  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury or death 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products contain contaminants or include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances 
insurance may not be adequate to cover any liabilities and may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover liabilities 
new privacy and data security laws may require changes in our practices  and there is a potential for enforcement actions due to noncompliance 
any new law or regulation pertaining to the internet  or the application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise seriously harm our business 
there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws or regulations may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and the quality of products and services 
there is a trend toward more burdensome regulations and stiffer penalties  all of which could negatively impact our business 
there is also a trend toward giving consumers greater information regarding and control over how their personal data is used  and requiring notification where unauthorized access to such data occurs 
in particular  several jurisdictions  including foreign countries  have recently proposed and or adopted privacy related laws that restrict or prohibit unsolicited e mail solicitations  commonly known as spamming  and that impose significant monetary and other penalties for violations 
these laws may increase concern on the part of advertisers regarding advertising in our email newsletters  and advertisers may seek to impose indemnity obligations on us in an attempt to mitigate any liability under these laws 
moreover  internet service providers may increasingly block legitimate marketing emails in an effort to comply with these laws 
one such law  the can spam act of  or can spam  became effective in the united states on january  can spam imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with the sending of commercial email 
the language of can spam contains ambiguities  and can spam has yet to be interpreted by the courts 
depending on how it is interpreted  can spam may impose burdens on our email marketing practices  on joint marketing initiatives that we undertake with our business partners  and on features of our services 
can spam also requires the federal trade commission to report to congress regarding the advisability of a federal do not e mail registry 
if the registry is created  it could have a detrimental affect our ability to continue our email marketing practices as well as advertisers willingness to participate in email marketing 
in addition to impacting our business through decreased collection and use of user data  the enactment of privacy and data security laws may increase our legal compliance costs 
while we believe that we comply with currently applicable laws  as such laws proliferate there may be uncertainty regarding their application or interpretation  and there is increased risk of noncompliance 
even if a claim of noncompliance against us does not ultimately result in liability  investigating a claim may present a significant cost 
future legislation may also require changes in our data collection practices  which may be expensive to implement  and may further increase the risk of noncompliance 
data security laws are becoming more stringent in the united states and abroad 
third parties are engaging in increased cyber attacks against companies doing business on the internet  and individuals are increasingly subjected to identity and credit card theft on the internet 
although we use what we consider to be industry standard security measures  there is a risk that we may fail to prevent such activities and that users or others may assert claims against us 
in addition  the federal trade commission and state consumer protection authorities have brought a number of enforcement actions against us companies for alleged deficiencies in those companies data security practices  and they may continue to bring such actions 
enforcement actions  which may or may not be based upon actual cyber attacks or other breaches in such companies data security  present an ongoing risk of liability to us  could result in a loss of users and could damage our reputation 
we may face potential liability  loss of users and damage to our reputation for violation of privacy practices 
our privacy policy prohibits the sale or disclosure to any third party of any member s personal identifying information 
growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and or litigation 
in the past  the federal trade commission has investigated companies that have used personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of a stated privacy policy 
if we are accused of violating the stated terms of our privacy policy  we may be forced to expend significant amounts financial and managerial resources to defend against these accusations and we may face potential liability 
we may be liable if third parties misappropriate our users personal information 
third parties may be able to hack into or otherwise compromise our network security or otherwise misappropriate our users personal information or credit card information 
if our network security is compromised  we could be subject to liability arising from claims related to  among other things  unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims or other misuse of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
consumer protection privacy regulations could impair our ability to obtain information about our users  which could result in decreased advertising revenues 
we generally ask our members and users to opt in to receive special offers and other direct marketing opportunities from us  our advertisers and partners 
our network also requests and obtains personal data from users who register to become members of the network 
registration as a member is required in order for users to have full access to the services offered by our network 
personal data gathered from members is used to personalize or tailor content to them and is provided  on an aggregate basis  to advertisers to assist them in targeting their advertising campaigns to particular demographic groups 
current or prospective advertisers evaluate our ability to provide user data to support targeted advertising 
privacy concerns may cause users to resist providing personal data  however 
if we become unable to collect personal data from a sufficient number of our users  we may lose significant advertising revenues 
changes in public acceptance of email marketing  and the perception of security and privacy concerns  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our use of personal data 
our failure to implement industry standard platform for privacy preferences  or pp  protocols could discourage users from using our web sites  products and services and from providing their personal data to us 
in addition  pending and recently enacted legislative or regulatory requirements that businesses notify internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user may heighten these concerns 
our network also uses cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
a cookie is information keyed to a specific server  file pathway or directory location that is stored on a user s hard drive  possibly without the user s knowledge  but is generally removable by the user 
information gathered from cookies is used by us to tailor content to users of our network and may also be provided to advertisers on an aggregate basis 
in addition  advertisers may themselves use cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
a number of internet commentators  advocates and governmental bodies in the united states and other countries have urged the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies 
if these laws are passed  it may become more difficult for us to tailor content to our users  making our network less attractive to users 
similarly  the unavailability of cookies may restrict the use of targeted advertising  making our network less attractive to advertisers and causing us to lose significant advertising revenues 
our business could be affected by future terrorist attacks or acts of war 
the terrorist attacks in the united states in recent years disrupted global commerce 
the continued threat of future terrorist attacks in the united states  and particularly in new york city where our headquarters are located  acts of war involving the united states  or any response of the united states government to any future terrorist actions or acts of war  may cause future significant disruptions in commerce throughout the world 
the proximity of our headquarters to certain possible targets in new york city could  in the event of war or future terrorist attacks  result in damage to or destruction of our headquarters as well as the permanent or temporary loss of key personnel 
we have not yet fully developed a disaster recovery plan and we cannot assure that our insurance coverage would adequately reimburse us for any damages suffered as a result of a terrorist attack or act of war 
risks related to our common stock as of march   hearst owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and had three representatives on our board of directors 
hearst is able to significantly influence our corporate direction and policies 
hearst s board representation and stock ownership allows hearst to significantly influence our corporate direction and policies  including any mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  strategic relationships or sales of assets 
hearst s board representation and stock ownership may also discourage or prevent transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which our stockholders would otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as of march   hearst owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to an amended and restated stockholder agreement we entered into with hearst on june   we appointed three hearst representatives to our board of directors  with one hearst designee appointed to each class of director 
the amended and restated stockholder agreement provides that the number of hearst representatives is subject to reduction if hearst s ownership of our common stock falls below certain threshold levels 
there is also a hearst representative on our nominating and compensation committees 
although hearst is required to vote all shares that it holds in excess of subject to adjustment of our outstanding voting securities in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors  hearst may effectively control certain stockholder actions  including approving changes to our certificate of incorporation or by laws and adopting or changing equity incentive plans 
hearst s effective control over stockholder actions may also determine the outcome of any merger  consolidation  sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other form of change of control that we might consider 
in addition  the interests of hearst  which owns or has significant investments in other businesses  including cable television networks  newspapers  magazines and electronic media  may from time to time compete with  or otherwise diverge from  our interests  particularly with respect to new business opportunities and future acquisitions 
market fluctuations or volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and limit our ability to raise capital 
the stock market in general and the market for internet based companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  often unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
the market price of the securities of internet companies has been highly volatile and is likely to remain so in the future 
we believe that in the past  similar levels of volatility have contributed to the decline in the market price of our common stock  and may do so again in the future 
trading volumes of our common stock can increase dramatically  resulting in a volatile market price for our common stock 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception that significant sales could occur 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been brought against companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
market fluctuations in the price of our common stock could also adversely affect our ability to sell equity securities at a price we deem appropriate 
if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock may decrease significantly 
public market analysts and investors have not been able to develop consistent financial models for the internet market because of the unpredictable rate of growth of internet use  the rapidly changing models of doing business on the internet and the internet s relatively low barriers to entry 
our sales cycle is also unpredictable and sales to advertisers or sponsors forecast in a particular period may be delayed or may not otherwise occur 
as a result  and because of the other risks noted in this discussion  our actual results might not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors in future periods 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock will likely decrease 
our future capital raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities  which would dilute your investment and could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
we may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
raising funds through the issuance of equity securities will dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 
furthermore  we may enter into financing transactions at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our common stock 
a negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
future sales of our stock could affect our stock s market price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares sold by directors or officers and shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or in connection with acquisitions  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents include interest bearing accounts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our interest bearing accounts 
we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial assets 
while we maintain our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions  at times these balances exceed insurable amounts
