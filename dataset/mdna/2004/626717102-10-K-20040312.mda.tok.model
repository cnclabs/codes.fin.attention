item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in north america and the united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in items and of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue primarily by selling its oil and natural gas production and its refined petroleum products to third parties at hundreds of locations in the united states  canada and other countries 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil fields  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in north america that are primarily located at wal mart stores  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s downstream operations are dependent upon achieving an adequate margin  which is determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of refinery feedstocks and gasoline purchases and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions 
in general  worldwide oil prices and north american natural gas prices were stronger in than in the average price for west texas intermediate crude oil in was  an increase of compared to the nymex natural gas price averaged in  up over these price improvements were a significant factor leading to higher profits in the company s exploration and production business in compared to the prior year 
the company did not fully benefit from the higher prices in  because approximately of its oil and natural gas production was hedged at prices that were lower than actual market prices in in addition  the higher prices for crude oil were a contributing factor to low refining and marketing margins in north america during a portion of if the prices for crude oil and natural gas decline significantly in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 
results of operations the company reported net income in of million  per diluted share  compared to net income in of million  per diluted share 
in the company earned million  per diluted share 
the higher net income in compared to was caused by a combination of better earnings in the company s exploration and production operations  a lower loss in refining and marketing operations  and lower net costs for corporate functions 
the income reduction in compared to was due to lower earnings in the exploration and production business  significantly lower earnings in the refining and marketing area  and higher net costs for corporate functions 
further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires the company to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded an expense of million  net of million in income taxes  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
further explanation of this accounting change is included in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million per share in  million per share in  and million per share in in december the company sold its interest in ship shoal block in the gulf of mexico 
the results of operations for ship shoal block have been reflected as discontinued operations in and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
therefore  the gain on disposal of million in and other operating results of the field have been included net of income tax expense as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and income from continuing operations was million per share in  million per share in  and million per share in

earnings from exploration and production operations were up in primarily due to higher oil and natural gas sales prices  a million after tax gain on sale of the ninian and columba fields in the uk north sea  record levels of oil production  higher tax benefits from settlement and rate adjustments  and lower property impairment and exploration expenses 
sales of natural gas were down significantly in primarily due to lower gas production in canada 
refining and marketing results in both north america and the united kingdom showed significant improvements in most of the improvement in north america was generated by stronger margins in the retail marketing portion of the business 
higher margins in the uk led to better income from this area 
the net costs of corporate activities were lower in primarily due to higher corporate income tax benefits related to settlement of prior year tax matters and lower net interest costs  partially offset by higher selling and general expenses 
sales and other operating revenues in increased by billion compared to due to higher sales volumes for crude oil and refined petroleum products  higher sales prices for oil  natural gas and refined products  and higher merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations 
gain on sale of assets was million higher in primarily due to a million pretax profit on sale of the ninian and columba fields in the uk north sea 
crude oil  natural gas and product purchases expense increased by million in due to higher costs of crude oil used for refinery feedstock  and higher costs and volumes of gasoline and merchandise purchased for sale at the company s retail gasoline stations 
operating expenses increased by million in due to higher operating and repair costs at refineries and higher operating costs at the company s growing retail gasoline station chain 
selling and general expenses rose by million in primarily due to higher retirement and incentive compensation expenses and higher costs for malaysian operations 
exploration expenses were million lower in mostly due to less exploratory costs incurred in malaysia 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by million in due to new production from the west patricia field  offshore sarawak malaysia  and higher depreciation associated with the company s growing retail gasoline station chain 
impairment of long lived assets was million lower in as the prior year included costs related to write off of destin dome blocks and  offshore florida 
the statement of income included million for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities following the adoption of sfas no 
on january  because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the time the abandonment occurs 
interest expense rose by million in due to higher average borrowings under long term debt during the year 
the portion of interest capitalized increased by million due to higher capital expenditures for development of deepwater gulf of mexico fields and expansion projects at syncrude and the meraux refinery 
income tax expense was million more in mostly caused by higher pretax earnings  the effects of which were partially offset by a million benefit from settlement of prior year tax audits in the us  an million benefit related to enacted tax rate reductions in canada  and an million credit from recognition of deferred tax benefits in malaysia 
vs 
income from continuing operations in was million  per share  compared to million  per share  in lower income in of million was mainly due to a million reduction in refining and marketing results  caused by both weaker refining margins in compared to in the us and us  and a million gain in from sale of canadian pipeline and trucking operations 
earnings from the company s exploration and production activities were million lower in than in as higher oil production  record levels of natural gas production and higher average oil sales prices were more than offset by lower natural gas sales prices  higher charges for property impairments and higher production and depreciation expenses 
sales and other operating revenues were million higher in than in due to higher crude oil production  record sales of natural gas  and higher sales volumes for refined products in north america and the united kingdom 
gain on sale of assets declined by million primarily due to the sale of canadian pipeline and trucking assets in interest and other income was million lower in due to less interest earned on invested cash 
crude oil  natural gas and product purchases expense increased by million in due to more purchases of finished

oil production from continuing operations in the united states increased to  barrels per day 
production from two new deepwater gulf of mexico fields medusa and habanero that came on stream in november more than offset production declines from mature fields 
oil production in canada increased in to a record volume of  barrels per day 
the production increase was primarily related to higher volumes produced offshore newfoundland at the terra nova and hibernia fields 
production at terra nova increased and averaged  barrels per day in hibernia production increased by to  barrels per day in net production from the synthetic oil operation known as syncrude fell barrels per day  or  in due to less efficient operations caused by more downtime for repairs 
production of light oil decreased barrels per day  or  due to continued field decline and various property sales during the year 
heavy oil production in canada increased barrels per day  or  during due to the results of development drilling  which was partially offset by lower production from various properties sold during the year 
uk production was down by  barrels per day  or  primarily due to sale of the ninian and columba fields in mid and production decline at the mungo monan field 
the company produced  barrels of oil per day in ecuador  higher than in  primarily due to a new heavy oil pipeline that began operations in the last half of production began at the company s west patricia field in block sk  offshore sarawak malaysia  in may net production from west patricia averaged  barrels per day for all  but averaged over  barrels per day since start up 
during  oil production from continuing operations in the united states declined compared to and averaged  barrels per day 
the reduction was due to declines from existing fields in the gulf of mexico 
oil production in canada increased in to  barrels per day 
the company s share of net production at its synthetic oil operation improved barrels per day  or  in due to a combination of higher gross production and a lower net profit royalty caused by increased capital spending related to an ongoing expansion project 
production of light oil decreased barrels per day  or  and heavy oil production decreased to  barrels per day in with both decreases primarily due to declines at existing western canada fields 
production at hibernia rose in to  barrels per day due to better operating efficiency  primarily associated with improved handling of gas production 
the terra nova field started up in january and averaged  barrels per day in uk production was down by  barrels per day  or  in primarily due to declines from the company s t block and ninian fields in the north sea 
oil production in ecuador was lower than and totaled  barrels per day 
this reduction was caused by more pipeline constraints  which forced the operation to limit daily production 
worldwide sales of natural gas from continuing operations were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in the total for was a company record for natural gas sales 
sales of natural gas in the united states were million cubic feet per day in  million in and million in the reductions in and were due to lower deliverability from mature fields in the gulf of mexico 
natural gas sales in canada fell from a record level of million cubic feet per day in to million in the reduction in was mostly caused by a steep production decline at the ladyfern field 
canadian natural gas sales had increased in due to higher production from the ladyfern field 
natural gas sales in the united kingdom were million cubic feet per day in  up compared to uk natural gas sales in decreased compared to levels and totaled million cubic feet per day 
the change in uk sales in each year was due primarily to the level of sales nominations at the amethyst field in the north sea

index to financial statements worldwide crude oil sales prices were higher in than in due to a strengthening world economy and effective production output controls by opec producers 
the company s average realized sales price for crude oil and condensate was per barrel in compared to in the worldwide average price was reduced per barrel by the effects of the company s hedging program 
the company had hedged the sales price in for most of its heavy oil production in canada and light oil production in the us  as well as a portion of its offshore and synthetic crude production in canada 
the us average crude oil sales price was essentially flat with and averaged per barrel 
light oil production in canada was sold at an average of per barrel in  up from heavy canadian oil sold at per barrel in  lower than in the average sales prices for offshore and synthetic oil production in canada were per barrel and per barrel  respectively 
offshore prices were higher than  but synthetic crude was lower by 
the average sales price in the uk increased by to per barrel 
ecuador production was sold at an average of per barrel  which was above the average for new production from the west patricia field in malaysia brought an average of per barrel in the average sales price for light crude oil in was comparable to  however  heavy oil prices were significantly stronger in comparison to light oil prices during the year 
in the united states  the company s average monthly sales price for crude oil and condensate declined compared to and averaged per barrel for the year 
in canada  the sales price for light oil rose to per barrel 
heavy oil prices in canada averaged per barrel  up from the sales price for crude oil from the hibernia field rose to per barrel 
the average sales price for oil from the new terra nova field was per barrel 
synthetic oil prices in were per barrel  up from the prior year 
sales prices in the uk were about flat with at per barrel and sales prices in ecuador were up to per barrel 
the sales prices for natural gas were much stronger in than in as high demand coupled with a tight supply buoyed prices 
the average sales price realized by the company in north america in was higher than in and averaged per thousand cubic feet mcf for the year 
this price was reduced by 
per mcf because of the company s hedging program in the us and canada 
in the us  natural gas sales prices averaged per mcf in  up compared to canadian gas prices increased to an average of per mcf 
natural gas was sold in the uk at an average of per mcf  higher than the average 
during  the company s north american natural gas sales prices were weaker than in generally due to a warmer than normal winter 
natural gas sales prices in north america decreased from and averaged per mcf in compared to in the prior year 
us natural gas sales prices decreased in and averaged per mcf compared to in the prior year 
canadian natural gas production was sold in at an average price of per mcf  lower than in the sales price for natural gas sold in the united kingdom increased to per mcf 
based on volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and 
per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 
production expenses were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel excluding discontinued operations during the last three years are shown in the following table 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil united kingdom malaysia ecuador worldwide excluding synthetic oil 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the lower costs in the united states in were due to both higher production and less well servicing costs 
the increase in the cost per equivalent barrel in the us in was attributable to a combination of lower production and more well servicing 
higher average canadian costs excluding synthetic oil in was caused by lower natural gas production and a higher average foreign exchange rate 
the lower average cost in for canada  excluding synthetic oil  was due to higher natural gas production volumes and new production from the terra nova field  offshore newfoundland 
the increase in unit costs for canadian synthetic oil operations in was attributable to a combination of lower production  higher maintenance costs and a higher foreign exchange rate 
the lower average cost per barrel for canadian synthetic oil in was due to a combination of lower maintenance costs and higher net production 
lower average costs in the uk in was mainly due to the sale of the high cost ninian and columba fields in the second quarter 
the increase in average costs in the uk in was due to both higher costs to maintain mature properties  primarily at the ninian field  and lower overall production 
production expense increases per unit in ecuador in were mostly attributable to higher transportation costs associated with the new heavy oil pipeline 
higher costs per unit in ecuador in were due to lower oil production compared to the previous year 
exploration expenses for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
certain of the expenses are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars exploration and production dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses dry hole costs were million lower in than primarily due to more drilling success in deepwater malaysia blocks 
the million increase in dry hole costs in was caused by higher costs for unsuccessful exploration drilling wells in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico and malaysia  which were offset in part by lower costs in for wells off the east coast of canada 
geological and geophysical expenses were up million in mostly due to d seismic acquisition and processing in blocks sk and pm in malaysia 
geological and geophysical costs were down million in due to less spending for d seismic on deepwater concessions in malaysia 
other exploration expenses were million lower in because more administrative costs in malaysia were charged to the production department after start up of west patricia field production in may 
other exploration expenses were million lower in primarily due to more charges to the company s partner in malaysia 
undeveloped leasehold amortization increased by million in and million in primarily because of lease acquisitions in each year in the gulf of mexico and western canada 
a total cost of million was incurred in to repair equipment and well damages caused by tropical storms in the gulf of mexico 
these costs essentially represent amounts not recovered through insurance policies 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense related to exploration and production operations totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in compared to was caused primarily by start up of the west patricia field in higher costs of million in were caused by higher oil and natural gas production  including start up of the terra nova field in january and more production from the ladyfern field in western canada 
the exploration and production business recorded million of expense in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities following the adoption of sfas no 
on january  because the abandonment liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment 
property impairments occurred in the united states in each of the three years ended december  the amount of impairments in was significantly higher than and because the company wrote off its remaining investment of million in destin dome blocks and  offshore florida 
based on an agreement with the us government  the company may not seek approval for development of this significant natural gas discovery until at least 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was in  in and in the lower rate in was attributable to several factors 
the company sold its interests in the ninian and columba fields in profits on these fields were assessed petroleum revenue taxes in addition to normal corporation taxes  thus the sale of these fields reduced the overall effective tax rate in the uk in addition  the company recorded an million deferred tax credit in to recognize anticipated future tax benefits on previously incurred expenses related to blocks sk and in malaysia 
these benefits had not been recognized in the income statement in previous years because the company had established a deferred tax valuation allowance until such time that it became probable that these expenses would be used to offset future taxable income 
also in  both the federal and alberta governments of canada reduced their tax rates for oil and gas companies 
the rate reductions led to recognition of an million tax benefit  mostly related to a reduction in deferred income tax liabilities 
the effective tax rate in was lower than in primarily due to higher benefits in the latter year from settlement of prior year tax matters 
approximately of the company s us proved oil reserves and of the us proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped 
at december   about of the total us undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis relate to deepwater gulf of mexico fields  including medusa  habanero and front runner 
the medusa and habanero fields came on stream in november and a portion of the wells were not completed and or producing at year end 
front runner is currently projected to produce first oil in the second half of in addition  of oil reserves in block sk in malaysia are undeveloped  pending further development drilling in future years 
on a worldwide basis  the company has spent approximately million in  million in and million in to develop proved reserves 
the company expects to spend about million in  million in and million in to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has obtained information from murphy and other oil and gas companies operating in the gulf of mexico to assess how the industry is determining proved reserves related to new field discoveries 
sec regulations allow oil companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either an actual production test or a conclusive formation test 
in the absence of a production test  compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves related to the initial discovery of the oil or natural gas field 
production tests in deepwater environments are extremely expensive and the oil industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility 
murphy has recorded proved reserves related to four deepwater gulf of mexico fields based on conclusive formation tests rather than actual production tests 
at the end of  proved reserves for these four fields totaled million barrels of oil equivalent  or approximately of the company s worldwide proved reserves  including synthetic oil 
two of the fields are currently partially on production and the third is being developed  with expected first production for the latter field in the second half of murphy believes the proved reserves are properly classified 
murphy has furnished the information requested by the sec and is unable to predict the outcome of the sec s staff review of the industry s practices 
this issue is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial results 
if the issue is not favorably resolved  the company may be required to revise the manner in which it reports its proved reserves  which could affect its finding costs per barrel and reserve replacement ratios 
refining and marketing the company s refining and marketing operations lost million in and million in earnings from this business were a record million in  including gains on asset sales 
the loss from refining and marketing operations was lower than the loss by million primarily due to better margins from the gasoline retail business in north america and the refining and marketing business in the united kingdom 
overall  the company s us refining margins continued to be squeezed in  primarily due to the high price of crude oil that the company was not able to completely pass on to wholesale and other refinery customers 
in addition to higher average fuel margins in at north american retail gasoline stations  the company s profits from merchandise sales at these gasoline stations were also better in during  the unfavorable refining and marketing results were generally due to two reasons extremely weak refining margins throughout most of the year in both the united states and united kingdom  and a million gain in on sale of the company s former canadian pipeline and trucking operations 
crude oil feedstock prices at the company s us and us refineries were higher in than in and the increase in wholesale and retail sales prices for refined products in did not match the increased costs of crude oil in the markets served by the company 
prior to the sale of the canadian operations  this business generated a profit of million in

they also  in most cases  require permits in association with new or modified operations 
many states also have similar statutes and regulations governing air and water  which in some cases impose additional and more stringent requirements 
murphy is also subject to certain acts and regulations primarily governing remediation of wastes or oil spills 
the applicable acts are the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  commonly referred to as superfund  and comparable state statutes 
cercla primarily addresses historic contamination and imposes joint and several liability for cleanup of contaminated sites on owners and operators of the sites 
as discussed below  murphy is involved in a limited number of superfund sites 
cercla also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous 
the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  and comparable state statutes  govern the management and disposal of wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes at the owner s property 
the oil pollution act of  as amended  under which owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
pursuant to the authority of the clean air act caa  the environmental protection agency epa has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels  which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel enters commerce or is used 
pursuant to state laws corresponding to the caa  several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels 
the company is also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in the company s operations 
the company operates or has previously operated certain sites and facilities  including three refineries  five terminals  and approximately service stations  for which known or potential obligations for environmental remediation exist 
in addition the company operates or has operated numerous oil and gas fields that may require some form of remediation 
under the company s accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
the company s liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
if regulatory authorities require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  future expenditures could exceed the accrued liability by up to an estimated million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the us environmental protection agency epa currently considers the company to be a potentially responsible party prp at two superfund sites 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
based on currently available information  the company has reason to believe that it is a de minimus party as to ultimate responsibility at both superfund sites 
the company has not recorded a liability for remedial costs on superfund sites 
the company could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at the two sites or other superfund sites 
the company does not believe that the ultimate costs to clean up the two superfund sites will have a material adverse effect on its net income or cash flows in a future period 
there is the possibility that environmental expenditures could be required at currently unidentified sites  and new or revised regulations could require additional expenditures at known sites 
however  based on information currently available to the company  the amount of future remediation costs incurred at known or currently unidentified sites is not expected to have a material adverse effect on future net income or cash flows 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by the company from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  the company has not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries at december  the company s refineries also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories spent catalysts usually hydrotreating catalysts  spent used filter media  tank bottoms and api separator sludge  contaminated soils  laboratory and maintenance spent solvents  and various industrial debris 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and amounted to million in in addition to these expenses  murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
such capital expenditures were approximately million in and are projected to be million in other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
because crude oil and natural gas sales prices were strong during and early  prices for oil field goods and services could be adversely affected in the future 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services

in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify an instrument that is within its scope as a liability 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective july  the adoption of sfas had no impact on the company s financial statements as the company had no financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the fasb issued sfas no

accordingly  murphy reflected the results of its crude oil trading activities as net revenue in its income statement and previously reported revenues and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts with no changes to net income or cash flows 
the effect of this reclassification was a net reduction of both sales and other operating revenues and crude oil  natural gas and product purchases by approximately million in and million in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in july the fasb undertook to review whether mineral interests in properties mineral leases held by oil and gas companies should be recorded and disclosed as intangible assets under the guidance of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fasb is considering whether an oil and gas company s investment in mineral leases should be classified as intangible assets 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
established new accounting guidelines for both finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets 
under sfas no 
and sfas no 
 intangible assets should be separately reported on the balance sheet  with accompanying disclosures in the notes to the financial statements 
sfas no 
does not change the accounting prescribed in sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  and is silent about whether its disclosure provisions apply to oil and gas companies 
the company does not believe that sfas no 
and sfas no 
change the classification and disclosure of oil and gas mineral leases and it continues to classify these assets as part of property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet and it does not provide the additional disclosures for these assets 
the eitf has added the discussion of oil and gas mineral leases to its agenda  which may result in a change in the recording and disclosure of oil and gas mineral leases 
should the eitf determine that oil and gas mineral leases are intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 the company would reclassify million and million as intangible undeveloped mineral interests at december  and  respectively 
in addition  a reclassification of million and million would be made as intangible developed mineral interests at december  and  respectively 
both intangible assets would be presented net of accumulated amortization 
historically  undeveloped mineral leases have been amortized over the life of the lease period  while developed mineral leases have been amortized using the units of production method over the expected life of proved reserves 
the amounts included herein are based on our understanding of the issue on the eitf s agenda 
if all mineral leases associated with oil and gas properties are deemed to be intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
by the eitf these assets would not be included in property  plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet we do not believe that our net income or cash flows from operations would be materially affected because the amortization of these assets would not be different than the method currently used by the company disclosures required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
relative to intangible assets would be included in the notes to the financial statements significant accounting policies in preparing the company s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies are described below 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the company 
the company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
see page regarding the sec s review of the oil and gas industry s recognition of proved reserves 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
costs of exploration wells in progress at year end were not significant 

table of contents 
index to financial statements impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable reserve revisions  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
the company can not predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other basis differences in ecuador and malaysia 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for certain deferred tax assets related to ecuador and malaysia due to management s belief that these assets are not likely to be realized 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations are shown below

table of contents 
index to financial statements material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end involve an oil and natural gas processing contract and a hydrogen purchase contract 
the processing contract provides crude oil and natural gas processing capacity for oil and natural gas production from the medusa field in the gulf of mexico 
under the contract  the company pays a specified amount per barrel of oil equivalent for processing its oil and natural gas through the facility 
if actual oil and natural gas production processed through the facility through is less than a specified quantity  the company must make additional quarterly payments up to an agreed minimum level that varies over time 
the company has committed to purchase hydrogen for the meraux refinery from a third party through the contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased 
payments under both these agreements are recorded as operating expenses when paid 
future required minimum annual payments under both of these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
during and early crude oil prices remained strong primarily due to uncertainty in iraq and the middle east  coupled with an improving global economy and effective price management practices utilized by opec 
high crude oil prices were a contributing factor to weak earnings and cash flows from the company s refining and marketing operations 
natural gas prices also were strong in and early  mainly due to demand for the product often outstripping supply in the short term 
due to the volatility of worldwide crude oil prices and us natural gas prices constant reassessment of spending plans is required 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and provides for capital expenditures of million 
of this amount  million or  is allocated for exploration and production 
geographically  of the exploration and production budget is allocated to the united states  including million for development of deepwater projects in the gulf of mexico  another is allocated to canada  including million for continued development of the hibernia and terra nova fields and million for further expansion of synthetic oil operations  is allocated to exploration and development in malaysia  and the remaining is planned for other areas  including ecuador  the united kingdom and the republic of congo 
budgeted refining and marketing capital expenditures for are million  including million in north america and million in the united kingdom 
planned spending in north america includes funds to build additional gasoline stations at wal mart sites 
capital and other expenditures are under constant review and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during in late  the company announced its intent to sell most of its conventional oil and natural gas properties in western canada 
the properties expected to be sold produce approximately  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
marketing of the properties to be sold began in february  and the sale is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the gain or loss on the sale and the operating results of the properties to be sold are expected to be accounted for as discontinued operations beginning in the company currently does not anticipate a significant increase in long term borrowings between year ends and although murphy s budget includes a robust amount of capital spending  the company expects the proceeds of the sale of western canada conventional oil and gas properties and normal operating cash flows to be sufficient to cover planned spending 
it is possible that long term debt could exceed the budgeted year end levels  especially if the sales proceeds in western canada are less than anticipated or if cash flows are adversely affected in the upcoming months by significantly weaker oil and natural gas sales prices and continued weak refining and marketing margins such as those experienced in early the company has made significant oil discoveries in deep waters off sabah  malaysia 
the company is currently preparing a plan of development and considering its alternatives for funding the project 
although it is too early to predict the ultimate cost of the development project  it is likely that a significant portion of the company s share of funding will come from borrowed capital

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  and foreign currency exchange rates 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
the company was a party to interest rate swaps at december  with notional amounts totaling million that were designed to hedge fluctuations in cash flows of a similar amount of variable rate debt 
these swaps mature in the swaps require the company to pay an average interest rate of over their composite lives  and at december   the interest rate to be received by the company averaged 
the variable interest rate received by the company under each swap contract is repriced quarterly 
the company considers these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates 
the estimated fair value of these interest rate swaps was recorded as a liability of million at december at december   of the company s debt had variable interest rates and was denominated in canadian dollars 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase the company s interest expense in by approximately million after including the favorable effect resulting from lower net settlement payments under the aforementioned interest rate swaps 
a increase in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar would increase interest expense in by less than 
million for debt denominated in canadian dollars 
murphy was a party to natural gas swap agreements at december  for a total notional volume of mmbtu that were originally designated as a hedge of the financial exposure of its meraux  louisiana refinery to fluctuations in the future price of a portion of natural gas to be purchased for fuel during through in each month of settlement  the swaps require murphy to pay an average natural gas price of per mmbtu and to receive the average nymex price for the final three trading days of the month 
at december   the estimated fair value of these agreements was recorded as an asset of million 
a increase in the average nymex price of natural gas would have increased this asset by million  while a decrease would have reduced the asset by a similar amount 
as described in note j on page f  at december   a portion of these agreements no longer qualified for hedge accounting and a portion of these agreements have been redesignated as a hedge of natural gas to be purchased by the superior refinery in murphy is subject to foreign currency exchange risk  primarily because of its operations in canada and the uk fluctuations in foreign currencies affect reported revenues and operating costs  capital expenditures and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
on occasion  the company has used financial currency contracts to manage this risk 
at december   the company had million in canadian dollar forward contracts that matured within days 
the fair value of these contracts was recorded in income at the end of and did not significantly impact the company s financial statements
