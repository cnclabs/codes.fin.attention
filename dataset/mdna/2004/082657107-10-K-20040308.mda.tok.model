item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in order to speed approvals within european union countries  a mutual recognition procedure has been established 
when a manufacturer submits a pharmaceutical product for marketing approval  it must designate whether the filing will serve as a reference authorization for other european union countries and  if so  which specific european countries 
if the filing is not designated as a mutual recognition reference filing  then other applications must be made individually to other countries for approval to be granted 
if it does serve as a reference filing  then the authority in the initial country is required to evaluate the submission on the basis of its own domestic standards as well as the standards of each of the countries listed by the manufacturer 
as the standards for pharmaceutical approvals have not been harmonized among the various european union members  various aspects of the filing must comply with standards that vary by country 
in addition  the process for initial evaluation of mutual recognition filings generally is significantly longer than for national filings and  as a result  companies often choose not to use this process for their first approval 
moreover  if the filing is rejected based on the standards of any of the countries selected  then the application will be rejected as a whole 
however  if the filing is approved for the reference and the mutual recognition countries  the manufacturer would be permitted to market the product in all of the jurisdictions selected 
a manufacturing facility is required to obtain a general permit to operate a pharmaceutical business certifying that its facilities comply with european gmps 
these permits are granted by the national authorities in the country of manufacture and other european countries rely on regulation by the home authority 
trends in healthcare regulation the cost of healthcare continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies  legislative bodies and private organizations 
in the united states  most states have enacted generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer s version of a drug for the one prescribed 
federal and state governments continue their efforts to reduce costs of subsidized healthcare programs  including restrictions on amounts agencies will reimburse for the use of products 
efforts to reduce healthcare costs are also being made in the private sector 
healthcare providers have responded by instituting various cost reduction and containment measures of their own 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we or the healthcare industry in general might be affected by these changes 
continuing reviews of the utilization  safety and efficacy of healthcare products and their components are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
these studies  which employ increasingly sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of such products and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use 
we maintain product liability insurance for such potential claims  however  no such claims have ever been asserted against us 
in western europe  efforts are under way by the european union to harmonize technical standards for many products  including drugs  to make more uniform the requirements for marketing approval from the various regulatory agencies 
many countries  directly or indirectly through reimbursement limitations  control the selling prices and reimbursement prices of certain healthcare products 
in addition  prices for prescription pharmaceutical products in spain must be approved by spain s ministry of health 
in order to help control rising healthcare costs  the ministry of health  in recent years  has encouraged the substitution of generic equivalent products 
in further efforts to reduce healthcare costs  the ministry of health had been contemplating new laws and regulations that would significantly reduce the market prices of certain pharmaceutical products  including generic equivalent drugs 
in late october  the spanish government enacted a regulation that reduced the prices that the government reimburses for certain prescription pharmaceutical products 
these new prices became effective on december   but were voluntarily implemented by some companies  including our spanish subsidiaries  on december  as a result  certain of our selling prices for these products have been reduced 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the regulation affected six of our chemical entities sold in spain which currently account for approximately to of our revenues  including the chemical entities omeprazole  simvastatin and enalapril 
however  we had been anticipating potential government regulations that could lead to lower selling prices and have developed  and continue to implement  a broad based growth strategy that should mitigate the impact of the new prices 
we cannot assure you that the government in spain or in other countries will not implement additional price reductions in the future 
in spain and in certain other european countries  there are regulations which prohibit a pharmacy from substituting another product if a doctor s prescription has specified a specific product for that patient 
recently  there has been intense scrutiny of pharmacists to assure that they are complying with this regulation 
other european countries permit the pharmacist to substitute products more freely than in spain 
any change in this regulation may negatively affect our sales in spain  as our products are often prescribed by name by doctors 
other regulations we believe that we comply with environmental laws that apply to us and we do not anticipate that continuing compliance will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings 
the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all of part of your investment 
our growth depends on identifying drugs suitable for our drug delivery technologies and expanding our generic and branded drug operations 
bentley s growth depends on the identification of pharmaceutical products that are suitable for delivery using our technologies 
our principal drug delivery technology is our cpe platform technology 
this technology  like other drug delivery technologies  operates to increase the amount and rate of absorption of certain drugs across biological membranes 
this technology does not operate independently and must be coupled with suitable pharmaceutical products in order to provide value 
consequently  our growth will depend to a great extent on identifying and commercializing these suitable drugs with respect to which we intend to expend significant resources and efforts 
identifying suitable products is a lengthy and complex process that may not succeed 
even if identified  products may not be available to us or we may otherwise be unable to enter into licenses or other agreements for their use 
in our efforts to identify suitable products  we compete with other pharmaceutical delivery companies with greater research and development  financial  marketing and sales resources 
if we do not effectively identify drugs to be used with our technologies  improve the delivery of drugs with our technologies and bring the improved drugs to commercial success  then we may not be able to continue our growth and we will be adversely affected 
we intend to expend significant resources and efforts toward identifying and commercializing products and technologies to expand our generic and branded drug operations in spain and to expand sales of these products outside spain 
although we already manufacture and market generic and branded drugs in spain  the growth of these operations in particular and bentley in general will depend to a great extent on identifying and commercializing additional such drugs for which we have existing capacity and infrastructure and  to a lesser extent  on increasing sales of existing products 
identifying and pursuing these new opportunities involves significant time and expense and we may not succeed 
even if identified  these products and technologies may not be commercially successful 
once identified  products to be manufactured and or marketed by us under generic or branded names are subject to successful negotiation of acceptable economic and legal terms  and successful progress of the product through commercialization  as to which we cannot assure you 
when expanding outside spain  we expect to compete in new geographic areas which are governed by regulatory regimes that we have not operated under before 
in these efforts  we compete with other pharmaceutical companies having generic and branded drug operations with greater financial  marketing and sales resources and experience in the geographic areas in which they operate 
if we do not effectively identify generic and branded drug products and technologies and bring them to commercial success  then we will not be able to continue our growth and we will be adversely affected 
the growth of our generic and branded operations may be adversely impacted by claims by others that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of their existing brand name products 
products using our technologies are in various stages of development and may not achieve commercial success 
independently as well as in conjunction with strategic partners  we are investigating the use of our technologies with respect to a variety of pharmaceutical compounds and products that are in various stages of development 
we are unable to predict whether any of these products will receive regulatory clearances or be successfully developed  manufactured or commercialized 
further  due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained  the time periods before commercialization of any of these products are long and uncertain 
risks during development include the possibility that o any or all of the proposed products will be found to be ineffective  o the proposed products will have adverse side effects or will otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  o the proposed products may be effective but uneconomical to market  or o other pharmaceutical companies may market equivalent or superior products 
we will rely on strategic partners to commercialize products that use our drug delivery technologies 
in light of our resources and the significant time  expense  expertise and infrastructure necessary to bring new drugs and formulations from inception to market  we are particularly dependent on resources from third parties to commercialize products incorporating our technologies 
our strategy involves forming alliances with others to develop  manufacture  market and sell our products in the united states and other countries 
we continue to pursue strategic partners for these purposes 
we may not be successful in finding strategic partners or in otherwise obtaining financing  in which case the development of our products would be delayed or curtailed 
we must enter into agreements with strategic partners to conduct clinical trials  manufacturing  marketing and sales necessary to commercialize product candidates 
in addition  our ability to apply our drug delivery technologies to any proprietary drugs will depend on our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships or other collaborative arrangements with the holders of proprietary rights to such drugs 
arrangements with strategic partners may be established through a single comprehensive agreement or may evolve over time through a series of discrete agreements  such as letters of intent  research agreements and license agreements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish such strategic partnerships or collaborative arrangements on favorable terms or at all or that any agreement entered into with a strategic partner will lead to further agreements or ultimately result in commercialization of a product 
in collaborative arrangements  we will depend on the efforts of our strategic partners and will have limited participation in the development  manufacture  marketing and commercialization of the products subject to the collaboration 
we cannot assure you that these strategic partnerships or collaborative arrangements will be successful  nor can we assure you that strategic partners or collaborators will not pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products on their own or with others  including our competitors 
we could have disputes with our existing or future strategic partners or collaborators 
any such disagreements could lead to delays in the research  development or commercialization of potential products or could result in time consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated by the sale of products that are formulated from two active ingredients 
spanish sales from two product lines whose active ingredients are omeprazole and simvastatin accounted for approximately and of our total revenues in  respectively 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our omeprazole products are currently purchased from one supplier 
in addition  we only have one supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our simvastatin products 
if we lose and cannot effectively replace either of these suppliers or are otherwise unable to continue the sales of products that contain these active ingredients  our revenues would decline significantly 
pharmaceutical pricing  changes in third party reimbursement and governmental mandates are uncertain and may adversely affect us 
our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare 
a substantial portion of our operations consists of marketing and manufacturing  primarily in spain  generic and branded pharmaceutical products 
the use of generic drugs is regulated in spain  the us and many other countries  subject to many changing and competing public policy considerations 
in addition  in certain markets  such as spain  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control through reimbursement limitations 
in addition  prices for prescription pharmaceutical products in spain must be approved by spain s ministry of health 
in order to help control rising healthcare costs  the ministry of health  in recent years  has encouraged the substitution of generic equivalent products 
in further efforts to reduce healthcare costs  the ministry of health had been contemplating new laws and regulations that would significantly reduce the market prices of certain pharmaceutical products  including generic equivalent drugs 
in late october  the spanish government enacted a regulation that reduced the prices that the government reimburses for certain prescription pharmaceutical products 
these new prices became effective on december   however  we voluntarily implemented the lower prices beginning december  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the regulation affected six of our chemical entities sold in spain  which currently account for approximately to of our revenues  including the chemical entities omeprazole  simvastatin and enalapril 
successful commercialization of many of our products  including those using our permeation technologies as well as our generic and branded products  may depend on the availability of reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment from third party healthcare payors  such as the government  private insurance plans and managed care organizations 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services 
such reimbursement may not be available for any of our products at all or for the duration of the recommended treatment with a drug  which could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize that drug 
the increasing emphasis on managed care in the us continues to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
some governmental agencies  including those in spain  can  due to insufficient supply  compel companies to continue to produce products that are not profitable for the company 
in the us  there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls 
we anticipate that there will continue to be a number of proposals in the us  as has been the case in many foreign markets 
the announcement or adoption of such proposals could adversely affect us 
further  our ability to commercialize our products may be adversely affected to the extent that such proposals materially adversely affect the business  financial condition and profitability of companies that are prospective strategic partners 
the cost of healthcare in spain  the us and elsewhere continues to be a subject of investigation and action by various governmental agencies 
certain resulting legislative proposals may adversely affect us 
for example  governmental actions to further reduce or eliminate reimbursement for drugs may directly diminish our markets 
in addition  legislative safety and efficacy measures may be invoked that lengthen and increase the costs of drug approval processes 
further  social  economic and other broad policy legislation may induce unpredictable changes in the healthcare environment 
we cannot assure you whether any of these measures may be enacted in some form  if at all  or the impact they may have if enacted 
if our clinical trials fail  we will be unable to market products 
any human pharmaceutical product developed by us would require clearance by the fda for sales in the united states  by spain s ministry of health for sales in spain and by comparable regulatory agencies for sales in other countries 
the process of conducting clinical trials and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals is lengthy and expensive and we cannot assure you of success 
in order to obtain fda approval of any product candidates using our technologies  an nda must be submitted to the fda demonstrating that the product candidate  based on preclinical research  animal studies and human clinical trials  is safe for humans and effective for its intended use 
positive results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials do not ensure positive results in more advanced clinical trials designed to permit application for regulatory approval 
we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials  even in cases where earlier clinical trials show promising results 
any of our product candidates may produce undesirable side effects in humans that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities  may suspend our clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or if they find deficiencies in any of our regulatory submissions 
other factors that can cause delay or terminate our clinical trials include o slow or insufficient patient enrollment  o slow recruitment and completion of necessary institutional approvals at clinical sites  o longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy  o lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  o adverse medical reactions or side effects in treated patients  o lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  o regulatory requests for additional clinical trials  and o instability of the pharmaceutical formulations 
our patent positions and intended proprietary or similar protections are uncertain 
we have filed numerous patent applications and have been granted licenses to  or have acquired  a number of patents 
we cannot assure you  however  that our pending applications will be issued as patents or that any of our issued or licensed patents will afford adequate protection to us or our licensees 
we cannot determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents that are now owned by or may be granted to third parties  the extent to which we may wish  or be required  to acquire rights under such patents or the cost or availability of such rights 
competitors may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways 
competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us 
competitors also may claim that we are infringing their patents  interfering with or preventing the use of our technologies 
competitors also may contest our patents by showing the patent examiner that the invention was not original  was not novel or was obvious 
in litigation  a competitor could claim that our issued patents are not valid for a variety of other reasons as well 
if a person claims we infringe their technology  we could face a number of consequences  including lawsuits  which take significant time and can be very expensive  payment of substantial damages for infringement  prohibition from selling or licensing the product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us  or reformulation  if possible  of the product so it does not infringe  which could require substantial time and expense 
as an example of the risk of infringement claims  in we were notified that a legal proceeding had been commenced in madrid against us by merck co 
inc and its spanish subsidiary alleging that we violated their patents in our production of the product simvastatin and in we were notified that a legal proceeding had been commenced in madrid against us by glaxosmithkline sa and its spanish subsidiaries alleging that we violated their patents in our production of the product paroxetine 
we cannot assure you that similar such actions will not be brought nor that they will not have an adverse effect on us 
we also rely on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary technologies and continuing technological innovations in the development and commercialization of our products 
we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop the same or similar technologies or obtain access to our proprietary technologies 
it is unclear whether our trade secrets will be protected under law 
while we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets  our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors 
our employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information have entered into or are subject to confidentiality arrangements with us and have agreed to disclose and assign to us any ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions that arise from their activities for us 
we cannot assure you  however  that others may not acquire or independently develop similar technologies or  if effective patents in applicable countries are not issued with respect to our products or technologies  that we will be able to maintain information pertinent to such research as proprietary technologies or trade secrets 
enforcing a claim that another person has illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets  like patent litigation  is expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the united states are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets 
regulatory approvals must be obtained and maintained for products incorporating our technologies and  if approvals are delayed or withdrawn  we will be unable to commercialize these products 
government regulations in the united states  spain and other countries have a significant impact on our business and affect the research and development  manufacture and marketing of products incorporating our technologies 
in the united states  spain and other countries  governmental agencies have the authority to regulate the distribution  manufacture and sale of drugs 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory approvals can  among other things  result in fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and or criminal prosecution 
in addition  governmental regulations may be established that could prevent  delay  modify or rescind regulatory approval of our products 
if we are unable to obtain marketing approvals to sell our products in countries other than spain  we may not be able to obtain additional revenues from sales in those countries 
we cannot assure you that products that have obtained marketing approval in spain will be approved for marketing elsewhere 
if we are unable to obtain marketing approval for our products in countries other than spain  we may not be able to obtain additional revenues from sales in those countries 
if we are unable to obtain these marketing approvals  we would have to seek to enter into collaborative arrangements to sell or license our products to strategic partners that have marketing approval in those countries 
we cannot assure you that we would find or enter into acceptable arrangements with such strategic partners to market our products  nor can we assure you that any such arrangements would be successful 
we must comply with good manufacturing practices in the production of pharmaceutical products 
any manufacturing facility for pharmaceutical products to be marketed in the united states is subject to fda inspection both before and after approval of a new drug application to determine compliance with the fda s good manufacturing practices requirements  as well as local  state and other federal regulations 
manufacturing facilities for our compounds to be marketed in european countries and elsewhere are also subject to european union and or other applicable gmp regulations 
facilities used to produce our compounds may not achieve or maintain compliance with gmp or other requirements 
the gmp regulations are complex and  if we fail to comply with them  it could lead to rejection or delay of an nda or comparable application 
any delay in approval of an nda or comparable application would delay product launch 
violation of gmp requirements after approval of an nda or comparable application  could result in remedial action  penalties and or delays in production 
all of our products are manufactured in one facility 
all of our manufactured products are produced in one factory in zaragoza  spain 
although we have constructed the factory with redundant lines for our most significant products that are in separate areas of the factory  and installed a fire suppression system  the destruction of the factory by a fire or other catastrophe would have a material impact on our revenues until we are able to rebuild the factory or secure an alternative manufacturing site 
we operate a significant portion of our business in  and plan to expand further into  markets outside the united states  which subjects us to additional business risks 
during the year ended december   of our revenues were derived from sales made by our spanish subsidiaries in spain and of our revenues were derived from sales made by our spanish subsidiaries to customers in other foreign countries 
we believe that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from sales in foreign countries 
conducting business internationally subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties  including o unexpected delays or changes in regulatory requirements  o difficulties and costs related to complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  o delays and expenses associated with tariffs and other trade barriers  o restrictions on and impediments to repatriation of our funds and our customers ability to make payments to us  o political and economic instability  o difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing international operations and implementing  maintaining and improving financial controls  o dependence upon independent sales representatives and other indirect resellers who may not be as effective and reliable as our employees  o inadequate or uncertain protection of intellectual property in foreign countries  o increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries  and o adverse tax consequences or overlapping tax structures 
currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues may be impacted by fluctuations in local currencies due to the fact that of our revenues currently are generated by our spanish subsidiaries  laboratorios belmac  laboratorios davur and laboratorios rimafar 
our spanish subsidiaries reported an increase in net sales of in local currency for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  however  an increase in the value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  had the effect of increasing revenues by approximately  during the year ended december  we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure because much of our expenditures are in the same currency as our revenues 
our foreign operations expose us to a number of currency related risks  including the following o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o limitations on the conversion of foreign currency  o fluctuations of the carrying value of long lived assets  and o limitations on the remittance of dividends by foreign subsidiaries 
if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological change and meet the intense competition in our industry  we may not succeed 
our success depends  in part  on achieving and maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in a rapidly evolving industry 
if we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies  our current and potential strategic partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors 
we also compete generally with other drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing  managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do and represent significant competition for us 
our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approval for products before we achieve success  if at all 
the products of our competitors may gain market acceptance more rapidly than our products 
developments by competitors may render our existing or proposed products noncompetitive or obsolete 
our competitive positions in our generic and branded drug operations as well as with our drug delivery technologies are uncertain and subject to risks 
in spain  and in other countries  we must demonstrate bioequivalence of our generic products  which may be challenged by branded and other generic competitors as well as regulatory authorities 
in order to demonstrate bioequivalence of our generic products  we must show that the rate and extent of absorption and levels of concentration of our generic products are not statistically different from other pharmaceutical equivalents that have previously been approved by the regulatory authorities of the respective country  when administered at the same dosage level under similar clinical conditions 
the competitive position of our drug delivery technologies is subject to the possible development by others of superior technologies 
other drug delivery technologies  including oral and injection methods  have wide acceptance  notwithstanding certain drawbacks  and are the subject of improvement efforts by other entities having greater resources 
in addition  our drug delivery technologies are limited by the number and commercial magnitude of drugs with which they can successfully be combined 
we may be unable to meet increasing expenses and demands on our resources from future growth  if any  or to effectively pursue additional business opportunities 
our revenues increased and our research and development expenditures increased from the year ended december  to the year ended december   challenging our management  administrative  financial  marketing  operational and research and development resources 
in addition  we routinely consider acquisition and investment opportunities  although we have no current agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisitions or investments 
any future acquisitions or investments would further challenge our resources 
if we do not properly meet the increasing expenses and demands on our resources from future growth  we will be adversely affected 
to properly manage our growth  we must  among other things  implement additional and improve existing administrative  financial  marketing  operational and research and development systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
we may also need to expand our staff in these and other areas 
we may not be able to complete the improvements to our systems  procedures and controls necessary to support our future operations in a timely manner 
we may not be able to hire  train  integrate  retain  motivate and manage required personnel  successfully integrate acquisitions or investments  nor successfully identify  manage and pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
if we fail to generate additional revenue in excess of increased operating expenses in any fiscal period  we may incur losses 
our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to raise or obtain needed funding 
we have used cash from outside financing to fund our operations 
substantial time and financial and other resources will be required to complete ongoing development and clinical testing of our products 
regulatory efforts and collaborative arrangements also will be necessary for our products that are currently under development and testing in order for them to be marketed 
assuming we continue our operations as presently conducted  we believe that we have sufficient working capital to meet our needs for at least the next twenty four months 
however our revenues from operations and cash may not be sufficient over the next several years for commercializing all of the products we are currently developing 
consequently  we may seek strategic partners for various phases of development  marketing and commercialization of product candidates employing our technologies 
further  we cannot assure you as to the sufficiency of our resources or the time required to complete any ongoing development and clinical testing  since the extent to which we conduct such testing is dependent on resource allocation decisions that we make from time to time based on numerous financial as well as operational conditions 
in addition to development and other costs  we expect to incur capital expenditures from time to time 
these capital expenditures will be influenced by our regulatory compliance efforts  our success  if any  at developing collaborative arrangements with strategic partners  our needs for additional facilities and capital equipment and the growth  if any  of our business in general 
we cannot assure you that we will receive additional funding on favorable terms if at all  or that we will be successful in attracting strategic partners 
if we cannot raise funds or engage strategic partners on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to continue our research and development activities  develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if we cannot attract and retain key personnel  we may not be able to execute our business plan as anticipated 
we have assigned many key responsibilities within our company to  and are dependent on  a relatively small number of individuals 
if we lose the services of our chief executive officer  chief science officer  vice president of pharmaceutical development  or the general manager of our spanish subsidiary  our ability to execute our business plan in the manner we currently anticipate would be adversely affected 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we maintain key person life insurance only for our chief executive officer 
we have an employment agreement with each of our key executive officers 
we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability claims 
the testing and marketing of medical products entails an inherent risk of product liability 
we may be held liable to the extent that there are any adverse reactions from the use of our products 
our products involve new methods of delivery for drugs  some of which may require precautions to prevent unintended use  especially since they are designed for patients self use rather than being administered by medical professionals 
the fda may require us to develop a comprehensive risk management program for our products 
the failure of these measures could result in harmful side effects or death 
as a result  consumers  regulatory agencies  pharmaceutical companies or others might make claims against us 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities  lose market share or be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could inhibit or prevent the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop alone or with corporate collaborators 
we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million euros approximately million us dollars and clinical trial insurance in connection with our clinical testing activities in various amounts on a study by study basis 
while management believes that this insurance is reasonable  we cannot assure you that any of this coverage will be adequate to protect us in the event of a claim 
we  or any corporate collaborators  may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses  such indemnification may not be available or adequate if any claim arises 
your percentage of ownership and voting power and the price of our common stock may decrease as a result of events that increase the number of our outstanding shares 
as of december   we had the following capital structure no 
of shares common stock outstanding  common stock issuable upon exercise of stock purchase warrants  exercise of options which are outstanding  exercise of options which have not been granted  total common stock outstanding assuming exercise of all of the above  as of december   we had outstanding options and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to exercisable at a weighted average of per share  of which approximately  options and warrants were then vested and exercisable 
since december  we have granted options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock  exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in addition  we may conduct future offerings of our common stock or other securities with rights to convert the securities into shares of our common stock 
exercise of our outstanding options and warrants into shares of our common stock may significantly and negatively affect the market price for our common stock as well as decrease your percentage ownership and voting power 
our stock is volatile 
the market prices for our securities and for securities of emerging growth companies have historically been highly volatile 
during the last two years  the price of our common stock has ranged from a high of to a low of 
future announcements concerning us or our competitors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
factors which may affect our market price include o progress of our relationships with strategic partners  o results of clinical studies and regulatory reviews  o technological innovations by us or our competitors  o market conditions in the pharmaceutical  drug delivery and biotechnology industries  o effect of regulatory authorities on pricing of products  o competitive products  o financings  o sales or the possibility of sales of our common stock  o our results of operations and financial condition  o proprietary rights  o public concern as to the safety or commercial value of our products  and o general economic conditions 
these uncertainties have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuation unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our business will suffer if we fail to comply with recent federal regulations and proposed rules of the securities and exchange commission and american stock exchange relating to corporate governance reform 
as a public company  we are subject to certain federal regulations and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the american stock exchange 
the sarbanes oxley act of required more stringent accounting  corporate fraud and securities laws 
to implement this legislation  the securities and exchange commission has adopted new rules and may adopt additional rules pertaining to  among other things  additional disclosure and reporting requirements  including requirements relating to internal control procedures 
the american stock exchange has also adopted various rules relating to corporate governance 
our reputation and financial results could be materially harmed by any failure by us to comply with any current or future rules or regulations relating to the sarbanes oxley act or to any other federal corporate or stock exchange reform measures 
delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan may prevent or discourage third parties or stockholders from attempting to replace the management of bentley 
as a delaware company  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  as amended  which is a statutory provision intended to discourage certain takeover attempts that are not approved by the board of directors 
section prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder subject to certain exceptions 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that also may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal that a stockholder might consider favorable 
our board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered three year terms  which makes it more difficult for an acquiror to change the overall composition of the board in a short period of time

business environment we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on o research  development and licensing commercialization of advanced drug delivery technologies and pharmaceutical products  and o development  licensing and sales of generic and branded pharmaceutical products and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals for others 
in our research and development activities  we have patents and other proprietary rights to technologies that facilitate the absorption of drugs 
our pharmaceutical product sales activities are based in spain  where we have a significant commercial presence and we manufacture and market approximately pharmaceutical products 
these products represent various dosage strengths and product formulations of more than chemical entities in four primary therapeutic areas cardiovascular  gastrointestinal  neurological and infectious diseases 
we also manufacture pharmaceuticals for other drug companies 
we develop products which incorporate our drug delivery technologies and have licensed applications of our proprietary cpe r drug delivery technology to auxilium pharmaceuticals  inc  which launched testim tm  the first product incorporating our drug delivery technology  in february testim a gel indicated for testosterone replacement therapy which restores serum testosterone levels in men and thereby improves symptoms of health problems associated with low testosterone levels hypogonadism  including loss of muscle mass and a decrease in sexual desire  sexual motivation and frequency of spontaneous erections 
we are in discussions with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to form additional strategic alliances to facilitate the development and commercialization of other products using our drug delivery technologies  including product candidates that deliver insulin to diabetic patients intranasally and treat nail fungus infections topically 
our generic and branded products are marketed to physicians  pharmacists and hospitals by our three separate sales and marketing organizations based in spain laboratorios belmac  laboratorios davur and laboratorios rimafar 
we continually add to our product portfolio in response to increasing market demand for generic and branded therapeutic agents and divest portfolio products that we consider to be redundant or that have become non strategic 
although most of our sales of these products are currently in the spanish market  we have recently focused on increasing our sales in other european countries and other geographic regions through strategic alliances with companies in these countries 
we have a strategic alliance with teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
granting us the right to register and market in spain more than of teva s pharmaceutical products through our sales force of approximately full time personnel located in major cities throughout spain 
in addition  our spanish manufacturing facility produces pharmaceutical products which are marketed by pharmaceutical companies both in spain and in other markets 
consolidated results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues in thousands increase revenues net product sales    licensing and collaboration revenues   total revenues    our total revenues increased from the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributed to the continuing growth of our spanish operations and secondarily to the advancement of our proprietary drug delivery programs in the us  as evidenced by the launch of testim  the first product incorporating our drug delivery technology  by our licensee in february our revenues are generated through our five primary sales channels branded  generic  contract manufacturing  sales outside of spain and licensing and collaborations 
see a summary of our revenues by sales channel and top selling product lines below for the year ended december  in thousands sales within spain contract branded generic manu other of total product line products products facturing revenues total revenues omeprazole    simvastatin    enalapril    codeisan   pentoxifylline   all other products    contract manufacturing   sales outside of spain   licensing and collaborations   total revenues      of revenues for the year ended december  in thousands sales within spain contract branded generic manu other of total product line products products facturing revenues total revenues omeprazole    simvastatin   enalapril   codeisan   pentoxifylline   all other products    contract manufacturing   sales outside of spain   licensing and collaborations total revenues      of revenues spanish operations 
the core of our spanish operations has been the efficient manufacturing and domestic marketing of branded and generic pharmaceutical products 
historically  our pharmaceutical products were sold only within spain 
however  the execution of our long term strategic plan over the past eight years has created an opportunity for our spanish operations to expand beyond the borders of spain and into other european countries and other countries outside of europe 
the growth in revenues was fueled by an increase in sales of our two major product lines  omeprazole and simvastatin 
sales of omeprazole and simvastatin increased to  in compared to  in the prior year 
the growth of these two product lines accounted for of our growth in revenues in the current year 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar over the past months  had the effect of increasing revenues by approximately  or  during the year ended december  prices for prescription pharmaceutical products in spain must be approved by the ministry of health 
in order to help control rising healthcare costs  the ministry of health  in recent years  has encouraged the substitution of generic equivalent products 
in further efforts to reduce healthcare costs  the ministry of health had been contemplating new laws and regulations that would significantly reduce the market prices of certain pharmaceutical products  including generic equivalent drugs 
in late october  the spanish government enacted a regulation that reduced the prices that the government reimburses for six of our chemical entities  including the chemical entities omeprazole  simvastatin and enalapril  which accounted for approximately to of revenues in the year ended december  these new prices were required to take effect on december  however  we  and some other pharmaceutical companies in spain  strategically implemented the new prices on december  our strategy was to gain additional market share by selling to customers that wanted to buy the products at the new lower prices 
we anticipated this opportunity as some of our customers delayed placing orders in november 
november sales declined by approximately percent from october levels  however  december sales demand was very strong as we gained market share as a result of our pricing strategy 
the increase in december unit volume offset the impact of the lower prices 
while the adoption of the new prices did not have a material effect on our total sales in december  it did reduce our margins 
over the years  we had steadily improved our gross margins on net product sales from in to for the ten months ended october  the improved margins were the result of economies of scale 
our gross margins in november slipped to as our fixed costs were absorbed by fewer units sold in that month 
upon reducing our prices in december of  our gross margins remained constant at  but unit volume increased by approximately over november levels 
we have implemented several initiatives to mitigate the decline in margins 
we expect to continue to increase our future sales volume through our pipeline of approximately products  consisting of approximately chemical entities that are not affected by the new pricing regulations 
in addition  we have modified our pricing structure in efforts to increase our sales volume and market share throughout spain 
we will continue to focus on acquiring  developing and launching new products that will improve our product mix 
we will also continue our efforts to increase our sales outside of spain through additional registration  marketing  and supply agreements 
we have made significant investments in renovating and increasing capacity in our manufacturing facility  as well as investments in new high speed  high volume equipment 
these investments will enable us to manufacture and package larger quantities of products more efficiently and cost effectively 
we anticipate that the current gross margins will continue until the existing inventory is depleted  near the end of the first quarter of and then we expect to see margins increase by about two percentage points 
thereafter  we expect margins to gradually improve  as they have in the past  as a result of increasing volumes and economies of scale 
branded pharmaceutical products in thousands increase branded product sales simvastatin   enalapril   omeprazole    codeisan   all other branded products    total branded sales    sales of our branded pharmaceutical products increased by compared to the prior year  although they accounted for only of total revenues in compared to in sales of our branded simvastatin increased by approximately  or approximately from the prior year 
sales of our branded enalapril increased by approximately  or approximately from the prior year 
sales of our branded omeprazole increased by approximately  or from the prior year 
sales of our branded codeisan increased by approximately  or approximately from the prior year 
while we expect to continue to develop  acquire  and launch new branded products  our focus on generics and sales outside of spain are expected to increase at a significantly higher pace than that of our branded products 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar over the past months  had the effect of increasing branded net product sales by approximately  or  during the year ended december  generic pharmaceutical products in thousands increase generic product sales omeprazole    simvastatin    pentoxifylline   enalapril   all other generic products    total generic sales    sales of our generic pharmaceutical products increased by compared to the prior year 
sales of our generic omeprazole increased by approximately  or approximately from the prior year 
sales of our generic simvastatin increased by approximately  or approximately from the prior year 
sales of our generic pentoxifylline increased by approximately  or approximately from the prior year 
generic products launched in  such as trimetazedine and paroxetine  accounted for approximately  of our revenues 
we expect to continue to increase our generic drug portfolio and increase our generic drug sales in spain as products come off patent in the future 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar over the past months  had the effect of increasing generic net product sales by approximately  or  during the year ended december  contract manufacturing in thousands increase contract manufacturing    in addition to manufacturing our own products  our spanish manufacturing facility supplies branded and generic products to entities in spain which market these products under their own name and with their own labeling 
revenues generated from contract manufacturing have increased by approximately from the prior year  but represented only of total revenues in  compared to of total revenues in the increase is primarily attributable to increased demand for formulations of omeprazole  our largest contract manufactured product line 
our increased capacity and high speed  high volume equipment enable us to manufacture pharmaceutical products at low costs 
this competitive advantage could lead to an increase in contract manufacturing agreements in as other pharmaceutical companies in spain search to find low cost alternatives to mitigate the new lower selling prices 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar over the past months  had the effect of increasing contract manufacturing sales by approximately  or  during the year ended december  sales outside of spain in thousands increase sales outside of spain    we have entered into license and supply agreements with more than entities to sell our products outside of spain 
sales under these supply agreements have increased from of total revenues in to of total revenues in the  increase is primarily attributable to demand for formulations of omeprazole  our largest selling product outside of spain 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar over the past months  had the effect of increasing sales outside of spain by approximately  or  during the year ended december  licensing and collaboration revenues 
licensing and collaboration revenues now account for of total revenues and increased by approximately  or approximately  in and include milestone payments and royalties from the commercialization and continued sales of testim  the first product incorporating our drug delivery technology  which was launched by our licensee  auxilium  in february testim is currently reported to capture approximately of all new testosterone replacement prescriptions in the market 
we have also recognized revenues totaling  during the year ended december   related to product licensing activities in europe  which we have included in the consolidated income statements as licensing and collaboration revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by approximately from the prior year 
approximately  or of increase  is due to the increase in net product sales and slightly improved gross margins in and  or of the increase  is due to the increased licensing and collaboration revenues in the current year 
our gross margins on net product sales in increased slightly to compared to in the prior year as result of economies of scale allocation of fixed costs over a larger number of units  reducing the per unit cost  partially offset by lower margins of generic products  which typically have lower prices  and the sales of certain of our products in the month of december at reduced selling prices 
we experienced an increase in gross profit of in local currency in compared to the prior year 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar over the past months  had the effect of increasing gross profit by approximately  during the year ended december  gross margins on certain of our products have decreased as a result of the recently reduced selling prices in spain 
although we were not required to sell products at the new lower prices until december   we strategically implemented the new price structure beginning december  our strategy was to gain additional market share by selling to customers that wanted to buy the products at the new lower prices 
see discussion above in spanish operations 
as discussed above  we have implemented several initiatives to mitigate the decline in margins 
we expect to continue to increase our future sales volume through our pipeline of approximately products  consisting of approximately chemical entities that are not affected by the new pricing regulations 
in addition  we have modified our pricing structure in efforts to increase our sales volume and market share throughout spain 
we will continue to focus on acquiring  developing and launching new products that will improve our product mix 
we will also continue our efforts to increase our sales outside of spain through additional registration  marketing  and supply agreements 
we have made significant investments in renovating and increasing capacity in our manufacturing facility  as well as investments in new high speed  high volume equipment 
these investments will enable us to manufacture and package larger quantities of products more efficiently and cost effectively 
we anticipate that the current gross margin percentages will continue until the existing inventory is depleted near the end of the first quarter of and then we expect to see margins increase by about two percentage points 
thereafter  we expect margins to gradually improve  as they have in the past  as a result of increasing volumes and economies of scale 
gross margins could decrease in the future if sales of higher priced products are replaced with sales of lower priced generic products  as a result of a change in our product mix or by additional governmental action 
however  as previously discussed we have developed  and continue to implement  a broad based growth strategy that should mitigate the impact on our margins over time 
selling and marketing expenses in thousands increase selling and marketing    selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately from the prior year 
the  increase  of which approximately represented increased sales force costs and approximately represented increased promotion and marketing programs  was instrumental in achieving a increase in net product sales 
however  the increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  over the past months had the effect of increasing selling and marketing expenses by approximately  in  accounting for approximately of the increase 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net product sales decreased to in compared to of net product sales in general and administrative expenses in thousands increase general and administrative    general and administrative expenses increased from the prior year 
the  increase was the result of increased general and administrative activities required to support our revenue growth in and prepare for our anticipated future growth 
such expenditures included costs of additional employees  outside services  occupancy costs  corporate communications  insurance  etc 
general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues decreased to in  compared to of total revenues in general and administrative expenses would have been approximately  lower in  absent the increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  over the past months 
we expect that our future expenditures for general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we grow 
although we cannot reasonably estimate the costs associated with implementation of the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  we do expect to incur costs not previously experienced 
research and development expenses in thousands increase research and development    research and development expenses increased approximately from the prior year 
the  increase is due to pre clinical programs underway in collaboration with universities and with product formulation and testing efforts being performed in the laboratory in our us headquarters and at our facility in zaragoza  spain 
we are using our us laboratory to develop potential product applications using our drug delivery technologies 
the expenditures in research and development reflect our focus on projects that are necessary for expansion of our portfolio of marketed products and clinical trials involving our drug delivery technologies 
we expect that our future expenditures for research and development activities will continue to increase as a result of programs that are necessary to advance new applications of our technologies 
we are currently in the planning stages of clinical programs to support the eventual distribution of certain of our spanish generic pharmaceutical products in other countries  including the us we have also undertaken a clinical program for the intranasal delivery of insulin and have recently completed a successful phase i study and are in the planning stages of additional clinical trials 
we expect to incur costs to conduct clinical trials and support the required regulatory submissions for these programs 
although some of our cost estimates are preliminary  and the specific timing is not known  our research and development expenses in could be  higher than in the year ended december  provision for income taxes consol in thousands spain us idated income loss before income taxes    provision benefit for income taxes    valuation allowance   net provision benefit for income taxes   net income loss    effective tax rate we recorded a provision for foreign income taxes totaling  approximately of the spanish pretax income of  for the year ended december  compared to a provision for foreign income taxes of  approximately of the spanish pretax income of  in the prior year 
the provision for spanish income taxes results from reporting taxable income from operations in spain  whereas the spanish provision for income taxes included approximately  as a result of reporting taxable income from operations in spain and approximately  as a result of capital gains taxes arising from the sale of biolid r  lactoliofil r and other drug licenses 
the provision for foreign income taxes would have been approximately  lower than reported  absent the increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  over the past months 
our us company recorded a provision for foreign incomes taxes payable totaling  for the year ended december  this amount represents payments due to the spanish tax authorities by our us company for withholding taxes on certain of our intercompany fee arrangements with our spanish subsidiaries 
no such amounts were recorded in prior years 
we generated additional us federal net operating loss carry forwards in and as a result of us pretax losses of  and  respectively

net income in the future could be negatively impacted as a result of the lower selling prices in spain and anticipated increases in research and development programs that are expected to benefit future periods 
however  as previously discussed  our broad based growth strategy should mitigate the impact of these developments over time 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues in thousands increase revenues net product sales    licensing and collaboration revenues total revenues    not meaningful net product sales 
net product sales increased by from  in to  in the  increase was primarily the result of our continuing efforts to increase sales in the generic drug market in spain 
we anticipated the opportunities in the emerging generic drug market in spain and began taking measures over four years ago to enter the spanish generic drug market 
we began to register  manufacture and market generic pharmaceutical products in spain and began aligning our business model to be competitive in this arena  including hiring and training a new generic products sales force  submission of generic equivalent products to the spanish ministry of health for approval and a marketing campaign designed to position ourselves as a leader in the spanish generic drug market 
we experienced an increase in net sales of in local currency in spain in compared to the prior year 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar had the effect of increasing revenues by approximately  during the year ended december  prices for prescription pharmaceuticals have been established in spain by the ministry of health 
in order to control rising healthcare costs  substitution of generically equivalent products is often encouraged 
in certain circumstances  the local governments in spain require that prescriptions for generic medications be filled using one of the three cheapest products on the market unless the prescription specifies a particular manufacturer s product 
these policies may have the effect of eroding gross margins  as sales of higher priced branded products may be replaced with sales of lower priced generic products 
we are striving to maintain product sales and gross margins by concentrating our efforts on increasing sales volume  being competitive in the generic drug market  developing new products and increasing exports outside spain 
licensing and collaboration revenues 
licensing and collaboration revenues totaled  in we entered into a research collaboration whereby our collaborator agreed to fund a research and development program to combine bentley s patented cpe drug delivery technologies with certain proprietary compounds 
our collaborator advanced to us  during the fourth quarter of  which we recorded as deferred income as of december   and we recognized it as revenue as the related costs were incurred 
we also recognized revenues totaling  during the year ended december   related to product licensing activities  which we included in the consolidated income statements as licensing and collaboration revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by from  in to  in the  increase was the direct result of the growth in our net product sales from to our gross margins on net product sales in increased slightly to compared to in the prior year as result of economies of scale allocation of fixed costs over a larger number of units  reducing the per unit cost  partially offset by lower margins of generic products  which typically have lower prices 
we experienced an increase in gross profit of in local currency in compared to the prior year 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  had the effect of increasing gross profit by approximately  during the year ended december  sales of generic products accounted for approximately of our net product sales during the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
although we expect to continue to benefit from economies of scale in the future as we grow  gross margins may decrease as sales of generic products  with lower margins  become more significant in the future 
additionally  the ministry of health in spain levies a tax on pharmaceutical companies for the purpose of funding rising healthcare costs in spain 
in  this tax had the effect of reducing gross profit by approximately  and gross margins by approximately percentage point

for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time frame 
we do not have agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services including payroll  information technology and maintenance  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation at will  without significant penalty

we plan to continue making improvements to our manufacturing facility during that include the acquisition of additional manufacturing equipment and expansion of our warehouse  in order to accommodate our expected growth 
we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures during seasonality  effect of inflation and liquidity 
in the past  we have experienced lower sales in the third calendar quarter and higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to seasonality 
as we market more pharmaceutical products whose sales are seasonal  seasonality of sales may become more significant 
neither inflation nor changing prices has materially impacted our revenues or income from operations for the periods presented 
we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twenty four months 
we continue to search both domestically and internationally for opportunities that will enable us to continue expanding our business and explore alternative financing sources for these activities  including the possibility of public and or private offerings of our securities 
in appropriate situations  that will be strategically determined  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contribution by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of products under development 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position  and results of operations and cash flows and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include o revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
o revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred when the customer takes possession of the products and or risk of loss has passed to the customer 
we provide our customers with a right of return 
revenue is recognized upon delivery of products  at which time a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience 
o revenue from service  research and development  and licensing and supply agreements is recognized when the service procedures have been completed or as revenue recognition criteria have been met for each separate unit of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
o royalty revenue is recognized based on an estimate of sell through of product based on prescriptions written  until such time that returns from wholesalers and pharmacies can be reasonably estimated 
o inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
o drug licenses and related costs 
drug licenses and related costs incurred in connection with acquiring licenses  patents and other proprietary rights related to our commercially developed products are capitalized 
capitalized drug licenses and related costs are being amortized on a straight line basis for periods not exceeding years from the dates of acquisition 
carrying values of such assets are reviewed at least annually by comparing the carrying amounts to their estimated undiscounted cash flows and adjustments are made for any diminution in value 
o provision for income taxes 
we have provided for current and deferred us federal  state and foreign income taxes for the current and all prior periods presented 
current and deferred income taxes have been provided with respect to jurisdictions where certain of our subsidiaries produce taxable income 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the remainder of our deferred income taxes  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in the us  because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our net deferred tax assets for which we have previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
o foreign currency translation 
the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of the period 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses are credited to or charged against other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies  the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
the disclosure provision is required for all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether the company utilizes the fair value method of accounting described in sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
s amendment of the transition and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
were effective for fiscal years ending after december  and have been incorporated in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the disclosure provisions for interim financial statements were effective for interim periods beginning after december  we have chosen not to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation at this time 
therefore  we continue to account for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation described by apb opinion no 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 which addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
establishes three principles revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  and revenue recognition criteria should be considered individually for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf issue no 
is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
in our third quarter of has not had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december  however  the adoption of eitf issue no 
may require the deferral and recognition over extended periods  of certain up front fees associated with our multiple element collaboration and license agreements and of our marketing  distribution and supply agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
a substantial amount of our business is conducted in europe and is therefore influenced to the extent to which there are fluctuations in the us dollar s value against other currencies  specifically the euro 
the exchange rate at december  and was 
euros and 
euros per us dollar  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate for the years ended december   and was 
euros  euros and euros per us dollar  respectively 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on long lived assets for the year ended december  was an increase of  and the cumulative historical effect was an increase of  as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
although exchange rates fluctuated significantly in recent years  we do not believe that the effect of foreign currency fluctuation is material to our results of operations as the expenses related to much of our foreign currency revenues are in the same functional currency as those revenues  the euro 
however  the carrying value of assets and liabilities can be materially impacted by foreign currency translation  as can the translated amounts of revenues and expenses 
nonetheless  we do not plan to modify our business practices 
we have relied primarily upon financing activities to fund our operations in the us in the event that we are required to fund us operations or cash needs with funds generated in europe  currency rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant impact on us 
however  at the present time  we do not anticipate altering our business plans and practices to compensate for future currency fluctuations 
interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on our short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt is and the balance outstanding is  as of december  a portion of our long term borrowings is non interest bearing and the balance outstanding on these borrowings at december  is  including imputed interest ranging from to of  the balance of our long term borrowings of  bears interest at the rate of 
consequently  the weighted average interest rate on our long term borrowings is 
the effect of an increase in the interest rate of one percentage point one hundred basis points to on short term borrowings and to on long term borrowings would have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately  annually
