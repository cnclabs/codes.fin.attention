the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the fund should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
overview the fund is a non diversified investment company that is regulated as a business development company under the investment company act 
the primary investment objective  as amended by shareholder vote on september   is to seek to maximize total return from capital appreciation and or income 
the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by providing equity and debt financing to portfolio companies 
historically the fund s investing activities have focused on private equity securities 
generally  private equity investments are structured as convertible preferred stock  and portfolio companies do not pay dividends 
consequently current income has not been a significant part of the equity portfolio 
private equity investments typically range up to million and the fund s goal had previously been for these investments to achieve liquidity within three to five years 
typically a cash return on the investment is not received until a liquidity event  ie such as a public offering or merger  occurs 
on september   the stockholders approved the current board s proposed plan  as discussed in part i  item  investment practices  and in item  submission of matters to a vote of security holders  which included i appointing michael tokarz as the chairman of the board and portfolio manager of the fund  ii adopting an amended investment objective whereby the fund would seek to maximize total return from capital appreciation and or income  and iii seeking to achieve its investment objective through senior and subordinated loans  venture capital  mezzanine and preferred instruments and private equity instruments and iv conducting a tender offer of up to of the fund s outstanding shares at a price of of the net asset value of such shares 
the fund did not complete any investments under the new investment objective as of the end of its most recently completed fiscal year 
on november   michael tokarz assumed his new position as portfolio manager and is in the process of seeking to implement the new strategy 
general investment climate during the current fiscal year  the fund continued to operate in the aftermath of the severe downturn in technology stocks and its profound impact on the technology venture capital industry 
m a activity and new issues of technology stocks began fiscal at pre levels but were demonstrating signs of modest recovery by mid year 
macro economic trends appeared to be guided throughout the year by the conflict in the middle east  the us political debate about both the form and amount of tax stimulus  and the outlook for job growth 
risk capital for emerging tech companies remained scarce as measured by the slow pace of fundraising by private venture capital funds and relatively stable quarterly disbursements by existing venture funds during the period 
it is estimated by the national venture capital association that more than half of the committed capital of private venture capital funds is held as reserves for follow on financing 
most follow on rounds in the technology venture backed companies during the past fiscal year took place at prices below existing holdings or on terms that were more favorable to the investors than for previous rounds of financing 
the fund s new management team will continue to evaluate every portfolio company for opportunities to participate in follow on investments that are believed to have potential for enhancing the fund s overall returns 
the fiscal year ended october  revealed that the venture capital industry continued its trend of devoting significant portion of its resources to poorly performing  unprofitable companies 
our co investors and the fund took steps seeking to get back to pre bubble standards of accountability and planning in providing assistance to the fund s portfolio companies 
this resulted in falling valuations for those technology companies without a clear path to profitability or wide acceptance of new technologies and products 
further  the standards for alternative methods of exiting private technology stocks  ie  ipos and mergers and acquisitions  have been raised  in management s view  to require profitable operating performance or significant market penetration 
the venture capital industry appears to have made moderate improvement  especially in the later half of  as measured by the increased flow of new deals and rising tech stock indexes 
these trends may help create a favorable climate for our existing holdings of technology based companies 
with the shift in the fund s investment objective in september to seeking total return from a broad range of private equity investments  including senior and subordinated loans across a broad range of industries and sectors  the investment climate for private technology stocks may have less of an impact on our activities in the new fiscal year and beyond 
this greater investment flexibility may permit us to take advantage of what appears to be an uneven economic recovery but there can be no assurances such strategy will be successful

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk historically the fund has invested in small companies  and its investments in these companies are considered speculative in nature 
the fund s investments often include securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale that adversely affect the liquidity and marketability of such securities 
as a result  the fund is subject to risk of loss which may prevent our stockholders from achieving price appreciation  dividend distributions and return of capital 
illiquid investments 
the fund invests in securities which are subject to legal or other restrictions on transfer or for which no liquid market exists 
the market prices  if any  for such securities tend to be volatile and may not be readily ascertainable  and the fund may not be able to sell them when it desires to do so or to realize what it perceives to be their fair value in the event of a sale 
the sale of restricted and illiquid securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading on national securities exchanges or in the over the counter markets 
the fund may not be readily able to dispose of such illiquid investments and  in some cases  may be contractually prohibited from disposing of such investments for a specified period of time 
restricted securities may sell at a price lower than similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale 
investments in unlisted securities 
the fund invests in unlisted securities 
because of the absence of any trading market for these investments  it may take longer to liquidate  or it may not be possible to liquidate  these positions than would be the case for publicly traded securities 
although these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions  the prices realized on these sales could be less than those originally paid by the fund 
further  companies whose securities are not publicly traded may not be subject to public disclosure and other investor protection requirements applicable to publicly traded securities 
growth stage companies 
while investments in growth stage companies offer the opportunity for significant capital gains  such investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk which can result in substantial losses 
the stock market has experienced volatility which has particularly affected the securities of technology companies 
as a result  the fund s performance may experience substantial volatility 
an investment in the fund should not constitute a complete investment program for the investor 
events of september  on september   terrorist attacks on the united states caused significant loss of life and property damage and disruptions in us markets and in global markets 
since that time  the united states has commenced military action and imposed economic and diplomatic sanctions 
the long term impact of these events  and of further possible terrorist attacks  is unclear  but could have a material effect on general economic conditions and market liquidity 
valuation risk 
the portion of our portfolio consisting of investments in private companies is also subject to valuation risk 
the market value of the fund s shares in large part depends on the values of the fund s investments and the prospects and financial results of the companies in which the fund invests 
many of the fund s investments are securities of private companies that are not publicly traded 
the financial and other information regarding the issuers of these securities that is available to the fund may be more limited than the information available in the case of issuers whose securities are publicly traded 
the current board and or the current valuation committee determine the fair value of these securities in accordance with procedures deemed reasonable 
however  fair value is an estimate and  notwithstanding the good faith efforts of the board of directors to determine the fair value of securities held by the fund  there can be no assurance that those values accurately reflect the prices that the fund would realize upon sales of those securities 
moreover  the prospects and financial condition of the companies in which the fund invests may change and these changes may have a significant impact on the fair values of the fund s investments 
we value our privately held investments based on a determination made by the current board and or the current valuation committee on a quarterly basis and as otherwise required in accordance with our established fair value procedures 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated values of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would exist if a ready market for these securities existed 
any changes in valuation are recorded in our statements of operations as net unrealized gain loss on investments 
investments in short term securities and cash and cash equivalents comprised approximately of the fund s net assets at october   and are subject to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates 
the fund has invested a portion of its capital in debt securities  the yield and value of which may be impacted by changes in market interest rates 
valuation of investments 
investments in non publicly traded preferred and common stock are carried at fair value with the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of increases or decreases in net assets resulting from its operations 
cost is used to approximate fair value of these investments until developments affecting an investment provide a basis for valuing such investment at a value other than cost 
the fair value of investments for which no market exists and for which the current board and or the fund s valuation committee have determined that the original cost of the investment is no longer an appropriate fair valuation will be determined on the basis of procedures established by the former advisor in good faith and approved by the current board 
valuations are based upon such factors as the financial and or operating results of the most recent fiscal period  the performance of the company relative to planned budgets forecasts  the issuer s financial condition and the markets in which it does business  the prices of any recent transactions or offerings regarding such securities or any proxy securities  any available analysis  media  or other reports or information regarding the issuer  or the markets or industry in which it operates  the nature of any restrictions on disposition of the securities and other analytical data 
in the case of unsuccessful operations  the valuation may be based upon anticipated liquidation proceeds 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation of portfolio securities which do not have readily ascertainable market values  the fund s determination of fair value may significantly differ from the fair market value that would have been used had a ready market existed for the securities 
such values do not reflect brokers fees or other normal selling costs which might become payable on disposition of such investments 
investments in securities that are publicly traded on an organized exchange are valued at their quoted closing market price  less a discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities valuation discount  if applicable 
investments in companies whose securities are actively traded in the over the counter market are valued at the average closing of their bid and ask prices  less a valuation discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities  if applicable 
if a reliable last bid and ask price are not available  market values for equity securities are determined based on the last reliable bid quotation available from a market maker in the security 
short term investments  including cash equivalents  having maturities of days or less are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
other fixed income securities are stated at fair value 
fair value of these securities is determined at the most recent bid or yield equivalent from dealers that make markets in such securities
