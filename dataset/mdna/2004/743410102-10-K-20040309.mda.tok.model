business strategy and global presence prologis was formed in with the primary objective of creating an operating company in the united states that would differentiate itself from its competition through its ability to meet a corporate customer s distribution space requirements on a national  regional and local basis  with the added benefit of providing consistent levels of service throughout the country 
prologis initial business strategy involved the acquisition and development of industrial distribution properties that it would operate and lease to customers in the united states 
these properties represented one operating segment the property operations segment as prologis intent was  and continues to be  to hold certain investments on a long term basis while generating income from leasing the properties to customers 
an integral part of prologis customer service focus has always been to have a portfolio of properties that meets the distribution space needs of its existing customers  as well as meeting the needs of targeted national and international companies 
as distribution space users expanded and managed their businesses for greater profitability  their distribution networks expanded and were reconfigured  including their distribution networks outside of the united states 
in order to meet the growing distribution space needs of these companies  prologis expanded its operations to mexico in  to europe in and to japan in in april  
table of contents prologis opened a representative office in shanghai  china to evaluate opportunities to initially serve customers in three targeted areas of china guangdong province and the shanghai and beijing regions 
in  prologis expanded its business to include the corporate distribution facilities services cdfs business operating segment 
the cdfs business segment began utilizing prologis existing development capabilities  which had been focused only on the development of properties for direct  long term investment  to develop properties for sale to third parties 
as with prologis property operations segment  the cdfs business segment operated initially only in the united states 
in  prologis expanded its cdfs business segment activities to europe to complement its european property operations 
the acquisition of an established industrial development business in the united kingdom in august provided prologis with access to strategic land positions in a country where previously it had only limited investments and where significant barriers for initial start up activities existed 
with both property operations and cdfs business segments in operation in the united kingdom and continental europe  prologis was positioned to be a single source pan european provider of distribution space to global users 
because prologis  as a reit  must distribute rather than reinvest substantial amounts of its internally generated capital  it must find public or private sources of capital to fund development activities and to grow its portfolio 
sales of properties to third parties in the cdfs business segment enabled prologis to begin recycling capital to fund some of its future development activities 
this ability to recycle funds in the cdfs business segment became a more integral part of prologis business strategy in early when the public equity markets became an increasingly costly method of raising capital 
as such  it was necessary for prologis to increase the volume of its cdfs business segment transactions so that it could self fund its development activities 
therefore  prologis shifted the focus of its cdfs business segment from developing and selling properties to third parties to developing properties that would be contributed to property funds property funds that would be formed by prologis by accessing private equity capital and that would be managed by prologis 
and  to supplement the private equity investments in each property fund  the property funds were positioned to obtain secured debt financing by using their properties as security 
today  the property funds leverage ratios typically range from to 
the first property fund was formed in august primarily with operating properties from prologis property operations segment 
however  the formation of prologis european properties fund in september embodied prologis overall property fund strategy that i allows prologis to realize  for financial reporting purposes  a portion of the development profits from its cdfs business activities by contributing its developed properties to a property fund profits are recognized to the extent of third party investment in the property fund  ii provides a source of private capital to prologis  iii allows prologis to maintain a long term ownership position in the properties  and iv allows prologis  as the manager of the property fund  to maintain the market presence and customer relationships that are the key drivers of the prologis operating system 
five of prologis property funds  all in the united states  were formed with a specific amount of private capital that allowed the property fund to generally make one portfolio acquisition from prologis 
in addition to its ownership positions  prologis provides these property funds with management services 
three property funds  one each in north america  europe and japan  were formed with third party capital commitments that are available to the property fund over time to allow these property funds to acquire properties as prologis cdfs business segment makes them available 
prologis business strategy has evolved to fit the environment in which it operates 
the primary driver in this evolution has been prologis focus on its customers needs for distribution space 
after years in operation  that focus has enabled prologis to become a leading global provider of distribution space operating on three continents 

table of contents prologis operating segments prologis business is organized into two operating segments property operations and the cdfs business 
property operations investments the property operations segment represents the long term ownership  management and leasing of industrial distribution properties 
prologis property operations segment at december  including assets owned by eight property funds in which prologis has ownership interests consisted of  operating properties aggregating million square feet in north america the united states and mexico  countries in europe and in japan 
prologis presents its investments in the property funds under the equity method 
of the total operating properties  prologis directly owned  operating properties aggregating million square feet 
prologis ownership interests in its eight property funds ranged from to at december  prologis investment strategy in the property operations segment focuses primarily on generic industrial distribution properties in key distribution markets 
prologis develops distribution properties in its other operating segment  the cdfs business segment  with the intent to contribute the property to a property fund or to sell the property to a third party 
also in the cdfs business segment  prologis acquires properties with the intent to contribute them to a property fund  generally after rehabilitation and or repositioning activities have been completed 
these properties  along with their operations  are included in the property operations segment after they are completed or acquired through the date they are contributed or sold 
the gains and losses realized from the contributions or sales of these properties are included in the cdfs business segment s income because they were developed or acquired in that segment 
at december   there were cdfs business segment operating properties aggregating million square feet at a total investment of million that were included in the property operations segment s investments on an interim basis 
property operations segment investment activities in included acquisition of two properties aggregating million square feet at a total acquisition cost of million with the intent to own these properties directly in the property operations segment rather than to contribute these properties to property funds 
disposition of properties aggregating million square feet generating aggregate net proceeds of million that were direct  long term investments in the property operations segment

table of contents property operations segment includes prologis proportionate shares of the net earnings or losses of the property funds recognized under the equity method  along with the fee income that prologis earns for managing the properties owned by the property funds 
in addition to property and asset management fees  prologis also earns fees for performing other services to the property funds  including  but not limited to  development  leasing and acquisition activities 
the net earnings or losses generated by operating properties developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment that are included in the property operations segment on an interim basis prior to their contribution or sale are also included in the operating income of the property operations segment

a property enters the stabilized pool at the earlier of months or when it is substantially leased  which is defined by prologis generally as 
overall occupancy levels decreased in from prior periods 
prologis leased percentage for the stabilized portfolio at december  was approximately lower than the percentage

prologis earned termination and renegotiation fees of million related to leases in its directly owned properties in such fees in were million 
in certain leasing situations  prologis finds it advantageous to negotiate lease terminations with a customer  particularly when the customer is experiencing financial difficulties or when prologis believes that it can re lease the space at rates that  when combined with the termination fee  provides a total return to prologis in excess of that which was being earned under the original lease terms 
prologis earned various fees from the property funds  primarily from property management and asset management services  of million in as compared to million in 
table of contents market presence prologis has generally invested in distribution markets in north america  europe and japan in which it has identified strong distribution dynamics as well as supply and demand factors 
in making its investment decisions  prologis evaluates market conditions that indicate favorable distribution growth prospects including  but not limited to i growth in imports and exports  ii long term cost and quality of labor advantages for domestic and international manufacturers  iii proximity to large regional and local population centers with good access to transportation networks  iv expansion and contraction needs of distribution space users located in the market  and v an historically high ratio of distribution space per capita 
prologis assesses its market presence not only in terms of its investments in the market  but also by the extent it has developed relationships with customers that have distribution space requirements in such markets 
prologis believes it can maintain these relationships by offering operating properties that are functional and cost effective  complemented by a comprehensive level of customer service 
prologis believes that by being a significant local owner and developer in multiple markets it has the ability to increase customer retention because it can meet its customers needs to either expand or contract through its network of distribution properties and land positions 
this network allows prologis to retain the customer by relocating the customer within its existing inventory of distribution space or readily developing a new property for the customer 
at december   the  properties aggregating million square feet in the property operations segment that are owned directly by prologis are located in markets in the united states  four markets in mexico and markets in seven countries in europe 
all of prologis operating properties in japan are owned by a property fund 
prologis largest markets in the united states based on investment in directly owned properties are atlanta  chicago  dallas fort worth  houston and san francisco both south bay and east bay markets 
prologis also has large holdings in several markets in the united kingdom

table of contents see item properties geographic distribution for a discussion of prologis defined markets and item properties unconsolidated investees property operations for additional information on the operating properties owned by the property funds 
competition in general  numerous other industrial distribution properties are located in close proximity to prologis properties 
the amount of rentable distribution space available in any market could have a material effect on prologis ability to rent space and on the rents that prologis can charge 
in addition  in many of prologis submarkets  institutional investors and owners and developers of industrial distribution properties including other reits compete for the acquisition  development and leasing of distribution space 
many of these entities have substantial resources and experience 
competition in acquiring existing distribution properties and land  both from institutional capital sources and from other reits  has been very strong over the past several years 
property management prologis business strategy includes a customer service focus that requires prologis to provide responsive  professional and effective property management services at the local level 
to enhance its management services  prologis has developed and implemented proprietary operating and training systems to achieve consistent levels of performance and professionalism in all markets and to enable its property management team members to give the proper level of attention to prologis customers throughout its network 
prologis manages substantially all of its directly owned operating properties and all of the operating properties owned by the property funds 
customers prologis has sought to develop a customer base in each market that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and that represents a broad spectrum of international  national  regional and local distribution space users 
at december   prologis and the property funds had  customers occupying million square feet of distribution space 
including customers leasing space in properties owned by the property funds  the largest customer and the largest customers accounted for and  respectively  of the annualized collected base rents of prologis and the property funds at december  when the customers leasing space in the properties owned by the property funds are excluded  prologis largest customer and its largest customers accounted for and  respectively  of prologis annualized collected base rents at december  employees prologis directly employs approximately persons 
prologis employees work in north america approximately persons  in nine countries in europe approximately persons and in asia  primarily in japan approximately persons 
of the total  approximately employees are assigned to the property operations segment 
prologis other employees may assist with property operations segment activities 
prologis believes that its relationships with its employees are good 
prologis employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
seasonal nature of the business the demand for industrial distribution space is not seasonal 
future plans prologis believes that its current level of direct investment in the property operations segment enables it to serve its customers at a high level and increase returns to its shareholders 
prologis business plan with respect to direct investments in the property operations segment allows for the expansion of its network of operating properties on a limited basis and only as necessary to i address the specific expansion needs of a 
table of contents customer  ii enhance its market presence in a specific country  market or submarket  or iii take advantage of opportunities where prologis believes it has the ability to achieve favorable returns 
prologis plans to continue with its current business strategy with respect to the growth in assets held by property funds 
prologis expects to achieve this growth primarily through the property funds acquisition of properties developed or acquired by prologis in the cdfs business segment  but also by their direct acquisition of properties from third parties 
prologis expects that the fee income it earns from the property funds will increase in over the levels as the sizes of the portfolios of operating properties in the property funds increase 
also  depending on capital availability  the number of property funds could increase in properties contributed to property funds must generally meet certain leasing criteria 
prologis observed a slowing in its customers decision making processes and in overall leasing activity in that it believes were primarily the result of weak economic conditions in the united states and certain western european countries 
prologis business plan for with respect to property fund contributions does not anticipate a significant improvement in prevailing economic conditions 
however  prologis market research and customer feedback indicates that the consolidation and reconfiguration of distribution networks in europe and japan have been  and will continue to be  key drivers in leasing decisions 
prologis believes that being a single source provider of state of the art distribution properties in europe and japan positions it to take advantage of these trends to the extent they continue in prologis intends to fund its investment activities in the property operations segment in with operating cash flow from this operating segment  its short term borrowing facilities and the proceeds from contributions and sales of properties properties that have been directly owned  long term investments in the property operations segment  as well as cdfs business segment properties that are included in the property operations segment on an interim basis prior to their contribution or sale 
see the discussion of factors that could affect the future plans of prologis and the property funds in the property operations segment at item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
cdfs business the cdfs business segment encompasses those activities that prologis engages in that are not primarily associated with the long term ownership  management and leasing of industrial distribution properties 
within this operating segment  prologis develops distribution properties that are either contributed to property funds or sold to third parties and acquires distribution properties that are contributed to property funds 
properties that are acquired by prologis in this segment are generally rehabilitated and or repositioned prior to their contribution to a property fund 
investments at december   prologis had distribution properties aggregating million square feet under development at a total expected cost at completion of million 
these properties are all being developed with the objective that they will be contributed to a property fund or sold to a third party

contributions and sales of properties aggregating million square feet that were developed or acquired by prologis in the cdfs business segment 
these transactions  the discontinuation of prologis participation and significant reduction of its investment in a joint venture and dispositions of land parcels that no longer fit in prologis development plans generated net proceeds to prologis of million 
acquisition of  acres of land acres in north america all in the united states  acres in seven countries in europe and acres in japan 
this land can be used for the development of approximately million square feet of distribution properties 
operations the operating income of the cdfs business segment consists primarily of the net gains and losses recognized from the contributions and sales of developed properties to property funds and third parties and from the contributions to property funds of operating properties that were acquired with that intent 
prologis uses its development and leasing expertise to rehabilitate and or reposition certain of the properties that it acquires such that the subsequent contribution of the property is expected to generate a profit to prologis 
prologis also earns fees from customers for development activities performed on their behalf and recognizes gains and losses from sales of land parcels when prologis development plans no longer include these parcels

competition until recently  prologis has been the only owner of distribution properties and provider of services operating on a global basis 
as such  prologis believes it has differentiated itself from many of its competitors 
there are a number of other national  regional and local developers engaged in industrial distribution property development in the north american markets where prologis conducts business 
prologis competes with these developers for land acquisition and development opportunities 
the disposition market in north america is very competitive and is driven by the supply of new developments  access to capital and interest rate levels 
a key component of prologis success in the cdfs business segment in north america will continue to be its ability to develop and timely lease properties that will generate profits when contributed or sold and its ability to continue to access private capital that allows for the continued acquisition of prologis properties by the property funds 
prologis competition in the cdfs business segment in europe generally comes from local and regional developers in its target markets as opposed to pan european real estate companies 
as in north america  the disposition market in europe is very competitive and is driven by the supply of new developments  access to capital and interest rate levels 
with respect to its development activities in europe  prologis believes that it has a competitive advantage due to the strategic locations of its land positions owned or under control in europe and due to its personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process 
prologis has identified one other north american industrial distribution development company who is in direct competition with its cdfs business segment in japan 
prologis believes that it has an advantage over the local development companies in japan due to its global experience in the development of industrial distribution properties and its global customer base 
customers prologis uses the customer relationships that it has developed through its property operations segment activities and the prologis operating system in marketing its cdfs business

prologis believes that its relationships with its employees are good 
prologis employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
seasonal nature of the business the demand for industrial distribution properties that are developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment is not seasonal in nature 
however  the development process can be impeded by weather in certain markets  particularly during the winter months  affecting the scheduling of development activities and potentially delaying construction completions 
future plans prologis success in the cdfs business segment depends on its ability to develop and timely lease properties and its access to private capital that can be used by a property fund to acquire properties that have been developed or acquired in this segment 
prologis believes that the reconfiguration of supply chains driven by the need for distribution space users to add efficiencies within their distribution networks will continue to favorably impact the demand for distribution properties and the distribution related services that prologis offers in the cdfs business segment 
also  the limited supply of state of the art distribution space in europe and japan could also provide opportunities within this operating segment 
prologis intends to utilize the capital generated through the contributions and sales of properties  the proceeds from public debt offerings that take advantage of favorable market conditions and its short term borrowing facilities to fund its future cdfs business activities 
prologis is committed to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund through september and all of its stabilized developed properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june prologis believes that  while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds will be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments  each property fund does have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available during prologis commitment to offer to contribute certain of its stabilized developed properties in north america to prologis north american properties fund v expired at the end of however  prologis north american properties fund v did acquire two properties from prologis in january while prologis north american properties fund v s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that is able to raise capital in the public market  there can be no assurance that prologis north american properties fund v will have the available capital to acquire additional properties from prologis in or  if capital is available  that prologis north american properties fund v will want to use its capital to acquire properties from prologis 
further  there can be no assurance that prologis will continue to offer to contribute properties to prologis north american properties fund v 
there can be no assurance that if existing property funds do not continue to acquire the properties that prologis has available  that prologis will be able to secure other sources of private equity capital such that it can contribute or sell these properties in a timely manner and allow prologis to continue to generate profits from its development activities in a particular reporting period

although the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has published a definition of funds from operations  modifications to the nareit calculation of funds from operations are common among reits  as companies seek to provide performance measures that meaningfully reflect their business 
funds from operations  as defined by prologis  is presented as a supplemental performance measure 
funds from operations is not used by prologis as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis ability to fund its cash needs 
funds from operations is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor does prologis intend it to present  a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance 
prologis believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings 
further  prologis believes that its consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and 
table of contents its operating performance 
the funds from operations measure presented by prologis will not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
at the same time that nareit created and defined its funds from operations concept for the reit industry  it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
prologis believes that financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders who review its operating results are best served by a defined funds from operations measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of funds from operations

management s judgments with respect to its level of influence or control of each entity involves consideration of various factors including the form of prologis ownership interest  its representation on the entity s board of directors  the size of its investment including loans and prologis ability to participate in policy making decisions 
management s ability to correctly assess its influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in prologis consolidated financial statements and  consequently  its financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by its shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 
in january  interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued 
interpretation no 
was revised in december the revised interpretation no 
fin r is applicable to prologis for the interim period that ends after march  fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and requires that prologis present the variable interest entities in which it has a majority variable interest on a consolidated basis in its financial statements 
prologis is continuing to assess the provisions of fin r and the impact to prologis of its adoption 
at this time  prologis expects that it will consolidate its investments in tcl holding sa  formerly frigoscandia holding sa tcl holding and csi frigo llc  a company that holds the voting ownership interest in tcl holding  as of january  through december   prologis has presented its investments in tcl holding and csi frigo llc under the equity method 
prologis combined effective ownership in these entities was at december  prologis expects that it will continue to present its investments in all of its other unconsolidated investees under the equity method after fin r is adopted 
management s ability to correctly assess its investments under the new rules with respect to variable interest entities will affect the presentation of these investments in prologis consolidated financial statements and  consequently  its financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by its shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 
impairment of long lived assets prologis and its unconsolidated investees assess the carrying values of their respective long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable and  with respect to goodwill  at least annually applying a fair value based test 
the determination of the fair values of long lived assets  including goodwill  involves significant judgment 
this judgment is based on management s analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each long lived asset 
management s ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value 
if there is a decline in the fair value of a long lived asset combined with a history of the asset generating operating losses  prologis or its unconsolidated investees will be required to determine whether the operating losses associated with the asset will continue 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of future operating results  the resulting cash flows and prologis intent to either hold or dispose of the long lived asset 
if an investment is considered impaired  a write down is recognized based on these analyses 

table of contents revenue recognition prologis recognizes gains and losses from the contributions and sales of real estate assets  generally at the time the title is transferred and prologis has no future involvement as a direct owner of the real estate asset contributed or sold 
in certain transactions  an entity in which prologis has an ownership interest will acquire a real estate asset from prologis 
management makes judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that prologis can recognize given its continuing ownership interest and its level of future involvement with the investee that acquires the assets 
management s ability to accurately assess the provisions of each transaction under the accounting guidelines for profit recognition could impact prologis financial position and specific items in its results of operations that are used by shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 
depreciation and useful lives of real estate assets prologis estimates the depreciable portion of its real estate assets and their related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense 
management s ability to accurately estimate the depreciable portions of its real estate assets and their useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying values of the underlying assets

rental expense recoveries as a percentage of total rental expenses has declined over the last three years due to the impact of lower average occupancy levels that have been experienced over this three year period 
lower occupancy levels will result in certain fixed costs being borne directly by prologis in instances where 
table of contents customers are not occupying the space to which the expenses relate 
additionally  prologis will absorb a higher percentage of common area costs when occupancy levels are lower because there are fewer customers available from whom these costs can be recovered

prologis ownership interest in prologis japan properties fund has been since its inception on september  prologis japan properties fund has increased its portfolio size from one property at inception to five properties at december  the stabilized operating properties owned by prologis and the property funds were leased at december   leased at december  and leased at december  prologis defines its stabilized properties as those properties where the capital improvements  repositioning efforts  new management and new marketing programs for acquisitions or the marketing programs in the case of newly developed properties  have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time  generally months 
a property enters the stabilized pool at the earlier of months or when it is substantially leased  which is defined by prologis generally as 
prologis believes that the reduction in its stabilized occupancy levels experienced in was primarily the result of weak economic conditions in the united states and certain western european countries  that resulted in a slowing of customer leasing decisions and a slowing in the absorption of new distribution properties in many of prologis markets 
additionally  prologis believes that geopolitical concerns and uncertainties  primarily in europe  in the early part of also contributed to the slower leasing activity 
prologis has not observed similar trends in japan 
prologis does not expect economic conditions to change significantly in while there were some positive trends in occupancy levels in certain markets in late  prologis believes that occupancies will not increase significantly but that further declines in occupancies  if any  will not be significant 
prologis continues to believe that shifts in distribution patterns of its customers in europe and japan and their needs to reduce their distribution costs have been  and will continue to be  key drivers of leasing decisions in many of its european markets and in japan 
prologis believes that the diversification of its global operating platform and the prologis operating system have somewhat mitigated the effects of market occupancy decreases 
rental rates in for both new and renewed leases for previously leased space million square feet for all properties including those owned by the property funds decreased by as compared to rental rate growth of in and in on similar transactions 
prologis believes that the negative rental rate growth experienced in is the result of decreased customer demand that negatively impacts the rental rates that can be charged in a particular market 
prologis same store portfolio of operating properties  properties owned by prologis and the property funds that were in operation throughout all of and  aggregated million square feet 
prologis views the operating results of the same store portfolio as a key component in evaluating the performance of its properties  its management personnel and its individual markets because this population is consistent from period to period  thereby eliminating the effects on performance measures of changes in the composition of the portfolio 
net operating income  defined for the same store analysis as rental income  excluding termination and renegotiation fees  less rental expenses  generated by the same store portfolio increased by in from in  the net operating income of the same store portfolio applicable to that period decreased by from the percentage change presented is the weighted average of the measure computed separately for prologis and each of the property funds with the weighting based on each entity s proportionate share of the combined component on which the change is computed 
in order to derive an appropriate measure of period to period operating performance  the percentage change computation removes the effects of 
table of contents foreign currency exchange rate movements by computing each property s components in that property s functional currency 
rental income computed under gaap applicable to the properties included in the same store portfolio is adjusted to remove the net termination and renegotiation fees recognized in each period 
net termination and renegotiation fees excluded from rental income were million for directly owned properties and million for properties owned by the property funds for  million for directly owned properties and million for properties owned by the property funds for  and million for directly owned properties and million for properties owned by the property funds for net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate their lease  offset by that customer s rent leveling asset that has been previously recognized under gaap  if any 
removing the net termination fees from the same store calculation of rental income allows prologis management to evaluate the growth or decline in each property s rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property s recurring operating performance 
customer terminations are negotiated under specific circumstances and are not subject to specific provisions or rights allowed under the lease agreements 
in computing the percentage change in rental expenses  the rental expenses applicable to the properties in the same store portfolio include property management expenses for prologis directly owned properties 
these expenses are based on the property management fee that is provided for in the individual agreements under which prologis wholly owned management company provides property management services to each property generally the fee is based on a percentage of revenues 
on consolidation  the management fee income earned by the management company and the management fee expense recognized by the properties are eliminated and the direct costs of providing management services are recognized as part of prologis net rental expenses reported under gaap 
cdfs business operating income from prologis cdfs business segment consists primarily of i the gains and losses from the contributions and sales of developed properties and from the contributions of properties that were acquired with the intent to contribute the properties to a property fund  including properties that have been rehabilitated and or repositioned  ii gains and losses from the dispositions of land parcels  iii development management fees earned by prologis for services provided to third parties  and iv income recognized under the equity method from prologis investments in unconsolidated investees through june  under the equity method  prologis recognized its proportionate shares of the earnings of prologis uk holdings sa  formerly kingspark holding sa  collectively with its subsidiaries  kingspark sa  a luxembourg company that performs cdfs business activities in the united kingdom and kingspark llc  a holding company that held the voting ownership interests of kingspark sa through june  prologis began consolidating its investments in kingspark sa and kingspark llc on july  see notes and to prologis consolidated financial statements in item prologis proportionate shares of the net earnings or losses recognized from its ownership interests in kingspark  sa and kingspark llc includes in addition to net operating income i interest income and interest expense net of capitalized amounts  ii general and administrative expenses net of capitalized amounts  iii income taxes  and iv foreign currency exchange gains and losses

in  prologis operating income in this segment decreased from by million 
this decrease was due to longer lease up periods for prologis cdfs business segment properties  as prologis observed a slowing of customers decision making processes with respect to changes in their distribution networks 
prologis attributes the decreased leasing activity experienced in to economic weaknesses in many of its markets coupled with geopolitical concerns and uncertainties primarily in europe during the early part of

table of contents distribution and dividend requirements prologis common share distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of its cash flow that ensures that prologis will meet the distribution requirements of the code and that allows prologis to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than operating income and net earnings 
cash distributions per common share paid in  and were  and  respectively 
the board set a projected annual distribution rate for of per common share 
prologis paid a distribution for the first quarter of of per common share on february  to holders of common shares at february  the payment of common share distributions is subject to the discretion of the board  is dependent on prologis financial condition and operating results and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 
prologis has increased its common share distribution level every year since its common shares became publicly traded in at december   prologis had four series of preferred shares outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on prologis preferred shares are per series c preferred share  per series d preferred share  per series f preferred share and per series g preferred share 
the series d preferred shares were redeemed in january pursuant to the terms of its preferred shares  prologis is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to its common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 
other commitments at december   prologis had letters of intent or contingent contracts  subject to prologis final due diligence  for the acquisition of properties aggregating million square feet at an estimated total acquisition cost of million 
through february   prologis completed the acquisitions of seven of these properties aggregating million square feet at a total acquisition cost of million 
the remaining transactions are subject to a number of conditions and prologis cannot predict with certainty that they will be consummated 
under a common share repurchase program  prologis may repurchase up to million of common shares 
the common shares that have been repurchased to date were purchased in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market prices and other conditions 
future repurchases  if any  are expected to be through similar transactions 
through march   prologis has repurchased  common shares under this program at a total cost of million 
an additional million of common shares may be repurchased under the program as march  prologis does not currently expect that it will make significant common share repurchases in prologis  from time to time  enters into special limited contribution agreements slca in connection with certain of its contributions of properties to certain of its property funds 
under the slcas  prologis is obligated to make an additional capital contribution to the respective property fund under certain circumstances  the occurrence of which prologis believes to be remote 
specifically  prologis would be required to make an additional capital contribution if the property fund s third party lender  whose loans to the property fund are generally secured by the property fund s assets and are non recourse  does not receive a specified minimum level of debt repayment 
however  the proceeds received by the third party lender from the exhaustion of all of the assets of the property fund combined with the debt repayments received directly from the property fund will reduce prologis obligations under the slca on a dollar for dollar basis 
prologis potential obligations under the respective slcas  as a percentage of the assets in the property funds  range from to 
accordingly  the value of the assets of the respective property funds would have to decline by between and before prologis would be required to make an additional capital contribution 
prologis believes that the likelihood of declines in the values of the assets that support the third party loans of the magnitude necessary to require an additional capital contribution is remote  especially in 
table of contents light of the geographically diversified portfolios of properties owned by the property funds 
accordingly  these potential obligations have not been recognized as a liability by prologis at december  and prologis has assessed a nominal value to the guarantee undertaken through the slcas 
the potential obligations under the slcas aggregate million at december  and the combined book value of the assets in the property funds  before depreciation  that are subject to the provisions of the slcas was approximately billion at december  derivative financial instruments prologis uses derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage well defined risk associated with interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on existing or anticipated obligations and transactions 
prologis does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market risk and credit risk 
market risk is defined as the potential for loss in the value of the derivative due to adverse changes in market prices interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows prologis to manage the risks of increases in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the effects these fluctuations would have on prologis income and cash flows 
credit risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation under the contract 
prologis does not obtain collateral to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of counterparties  primarily global commercial banks 
prologis does not anticipate non performance by any of the counterparties to its derivative contracts 
however  should a counterparty fail to perform  prologis would incur a financial loss to the extent of the positive fair market value of the derivative contracts  if any 
at december   prologis had foreign currency put option contracts outstanding in the notional amount of million euro  million pound sterling and million yen the aggregate currency equivalent of approximately million at december  related to its operations in europe and japan 
the put option contracts were paid in full at execution and provide prologis with the option to exchange euro  pound sterling and yen for us dollars at a fixed exchange rate such that  if the euro  pound sterling or yen were to depreciate against the us dollar to predetermined levels as set by the contracts  prologis could exercise its options and mitigate its foreign currency exchange losses 
the outstanding contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were marked to market through results of operations at december  in  prologis recognized aggregate expense of million on various put option contracts  including mark to market gains of million 
at december   prologis had an outstanding foreign currency forward swap contract that is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of its investments in europe 
the notional amount of the contract is million euro the currency equivalent of approximately million at december  
the contract allows prologis to sell euro at a fixed exchange rate to the us dollar and is settled at maturity 
at december   prologis had outstanding two interest rate swap contracts related to anticipated transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges 
the aggregate notional amounts of the contracts are million euro the currency equivalent of approximately million at december  
the contracts allow prologis to fix the interest rate associated with a portion of a debt instrument forecasted to be issued in for a seven year period 
the foreign currency forward swap contract and the interest rate swap contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
prologis recognized mark to market adjustments representing a net decrease in the values of these contracts of million in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity at december  funds from operations funds from operations is a financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry 
although nareit has published a definition of funds from operations  modifications to the nareit calculation of funds from operations are common among reits  as companies seek to provide performance measures that meaningfully reflect their business 
funds from operations  as defined by prologis  is presented as a 
table of contents supplemental performance measure 
funds from operations is not used by prologis as  nor should it be considered to be  an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of prologis ability to fund its cash needs 
funds from operations is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor does prologis intend it to present  a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance 
prologis believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings 
further  prologis believes that its consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 
nareit s funds from operations measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated properties 
prologis agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit s definition of funds from operations reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 
b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit s definition of funds from operations  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
at the same time that nareit created and defined its funds from operations concept for the reit industry  it also recognized that management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
prologis believes that financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders who review its operating results are best served by a defined funds from operations measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit defined measure of funds from operations 
the prologis defined funds from operations measure excludes the following items from net earnings computed under gaap that are not excluded in the nareit defined funds from operations measure i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by prologis taxable subsidiaries  ii certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from certain debt transactions between prologis and its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees  iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of certain third party debt of prologis foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees  and iv mark to market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments utilized to manage prologis foreign currency risks 
funds from operations of prologis unconsolidated investees is calculated on the same basis as prologis 
the items that prologis excludes from net earnings  while not infrequent or unusual  are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative effects on prologis results of operations  in inconsistent and unpredictable directions 
most importantly  the economics underlying the items that prologis excludes from net earnings are not the primary drivers in management s decision making process and capital investment decisions 
period to period fluctuations in these items can be driven by accounting for short term factors that are not relevant to long term investment decisions  long term capital 
table of contents structures or to long term tax planning and tax structuring decisions 
accordingly  prologis believes that investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of prologis operating results along the same lines that prologis management uses in planning and executing its business strategy 
real estate is a capital intensive business 
investors analyses of the performance of real estate companies tend to be centered on understanding the asset value created by real estate investment decisions and understanding current operating returns that are being generated by those same investment decisions 
the adjustments to net earnings that are included in arriving at the prologis defined funds from operations measure are helpful to management in making real estate investment decisions and evaluating its current operating performance 
prologis believes that these adjustments are also helpful to industry analysts  potential investors and shareholders in their understanding and evaluation of prologis performance on the key measures of net asset value and current operating returns generated on real estate investments 
funds from operations attributable to common shares as defined by prologis was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reconciliations of funds from operations attributable to common shares as defined by prologis to net earnings attributable to common shares computed under gaap are as follows for the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars years ended december  funds from operations reconciliation of net earnings to funds from operations as defined by prologis net earnings attributable to common shares add deduct nareit defined adjustments real estate related depreciation and amortization gains on contributions and sales of non cdfs business segment assets  net funds from operations adjustment to gain on partial redemption of investment prologis share of reconciling items of unconsolidated investees real estate related depreciation and amortization funds from operations adjustment to gain recognized on disposition of cdfs business segment assets gains losses on contributions and sales of non cdfs business segment assets  net total nareit defined adjustments subtotal nareit defined funds from operations add deduct prologis defined adjustments foreign currency exchange gains expenses losses  net deferred income tax expense prologis share of reconciling items of unconsolidated investees foreign currency exchange gains expenses losses  net deferred income tax benefit 
table of contents years ended december  total prologis defined adjustments funds from operations attributable to common shares as defined by prologis risk factors prologis operations involve various risks that could adversely affect prologis financial condition  results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of prologis common shares 
these risks include  among others general real estate risks general economic conditions prologis is exposed to the general economic conditions and the local  regional  national and international economic conditions that affect the markets in which it owns properties 
prologis operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which it has concentrations of properties 
prologis does not have in excess of of its directly owned portfolio in any one market  nor does it have in excess of of its total portfolio including properties owned by the property funds in any one market 
however  prologis does have significant holdings in atlanta  chicago  dallas ft 
worth  houston  los angeles  paris  san francisco and certain markets in the united kingdom 
prologis operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions in the markets with concentrations of properties  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space  become less favorable 
any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction of demand for distribution space could adversely affect prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of prologis common shares 
risks particular to real estate real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
while prologis seeks to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of its portfolio  market research and its property management capabilities  these risks cannot be eliminated 
the factors that can affect real estate values include changes in the general economic climate  local conditions  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space in an area  the attractiveness of prologis properties to potential customers  competition from other available properties  prologis ability to provide adequate maintenance of  and insurance on  its properties  prologis ability to control variable operating costs  governmental regulations  including zoning  usage and tax laws and changes in these laws  and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning and other laws 
risks associated with concentration of prologis investments in the industrial sector prologis investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector 
this concentration may expose prologis to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if prologis business activities included other types of real estate investments 

table of contents risks associated with prologis development activities prologis has developed a significant number of distribution properties since its inception and intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise 
such development activities generally require various government and other approvals and prologis may not receive such approvals 
prologis will be subject to risks associated with such development activities including  but not limited to the risk that development opportunities explored by prologis may be abandoned and that the related investment will be written off  the risk that construction costs of a property may exceed the original estimates or that construction may not be concluded on schedule could make the project less profitable than originally estimated  specific risks include  but are not limited to  the possibility of contract default  the effects of local weather conditions  the possibility of local or national strikes and the possibility of shortages in materials  building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment  and the risk that occupancy levels and the rents that can be charged for a completed project will not make the project as profitable as originally estimated 
risks associated with the contribution and sale of properties prologis has contributed to property funds or sold to third parties  a significant number of distribution properties in recent years 
prologis intends to continue to contribute and sell properties as opportunities arise  particularly from its cdfs business segment 
prologis ability to contribute or sell properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon several factors  some of which are beyond the control of prologis management  primarily competition from other owners of distribution properties that are trying to dispose of their properties 
prologis ability to develop and timely lease properties will impact prologis ability to contribute or sell these properties 
continued access to private debt and equity capital by the property funds is necessary in order for prologis to continue its strategy of contributing properties to the property funds 
should prologis not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds  or should the property funds have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms  then these contributions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on prologis liquidity and on its ability to meet projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and on the value of prologis common shares 
further  prologis inability to redeploy the proceeds from its divestitures in accordance with its investment strategy could have an adverse affect on prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares in subsequent periods 
risks associated with acquisition of properties prologis acquires distribution properties from time to time 
the acquisition of properties involves risks  including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and the risk that any actual costs for rehabilitation  repositioning  renovation and improvements identified in the pre acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates 
there is  and it is expected that there will continue to be  significant competition for investment opportunities that meet prologis investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities  if necessary 
tenant default prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares would be adversely affected if a significant number of prologis tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations to prologis 
in the event of default by a significant number of tenants  prologis may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord 

table of contents ability to renew leases or re lease space as leases expire prologis results of operations  distributable cash flow and the value of its common shares would be adversely affected if prologis is unable to lease  on economically favorable terms  a significant amount of space in its distribution properties 
prologis had million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december  or were on a month to month basis at that date and prologis has million square feet of distribution space out of a total of million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in in its directly owned properties 
the property funds had a combined million square feet of distribution space with leases that either expired on december  or were on a month to month basis at that date and the property funds have a combined million square feet of distribution space out of a total of million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in the number of distribution properties in a market or submarket could adversely affect both prologis ability to re lease distribution space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 
real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may tend to limit prologis ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant expenditures associated with real estate investments  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
like other companies qualifying as reits under the code  prologis must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of properties that can be disposed of in a year  the tax bases and the costs of improvements made to these properties  and meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
thus  prologis ability at any time to sell assets  or contribute assets to property funds or other entities in which prologis has an ownership interest may be restricted 
prologis insurance coverage does not include all potential losses prologis and its unconsolidated investees currently carry comprehensive insurance coverage including property  liability  fire  flood  earthquake  environmental  terrorism  extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of their properties and their business operations are located 
the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties  business activities and markets 
prologis believes its properties and the properties of its unconsolidated investees are adequately insured 
however  there are certain losses  including losses from floods and losses from earthquakes  acts of war  acts of terrorism or riots  that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed to be economically feasible or prudent to do so 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of prologis properties  prologis could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 
potential environmental liability under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in its property 
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
prologis conducts phase i environmental assessments as part of its due diligence activities 
prologis has not been notified nor is prologis aware of any environmental condition with respect to its real estate assets that are likely to be material to prologis financial condition 
however  prologis cannot give any assurance that such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future 
the presence of such substances on prologis real estate investments could adversely affect its ability to sell such investments or to borrow using such investments as collateral and may also have an adverse effect on prologis distributable cash flow 

table of contents financing and capital risks access to capital prologis  as a reit  is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to its shareholders 
consequently  prologis is  as are all reits  largely dependent on external capital to fund its development and acquisition activities 
prologis has been accessing private debt and equity capital through the establishment of property funds that acquire properties from prologis 
prologis ability to access private debt and equity capital through its property funds on favorable terms  or at all  is dependent upon a number of factors  including general market conditions and competition from other real estate companies 
further  prologis generates significant profits as a result of the contributions of properties to the property funds 
to the extent that private capital is not available to the property funds to allow them to acquire properties from prologis  these profits may not be realized or their realization may be delayed which could result in an earnings stream that is less predictable than some of prologis competitors and result in prologis not meeting its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on the value of common shares 
prologis is committed to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties available in specific markets in europe to prologis european properties fund through september and all of its stabilized developed properties available in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june prologis believes that  while the current capital commitments and borrowing capacities of these property funds will be expended prior to the expiration dates of these commitments  each property fund does have sufficient capital to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available during prologis commitment to offer to contribute certain of its stabilized developed properties in north america to prologis north american properties fund v expired at the end of however  prologis north american properties fund v did acquire two properties from prologis in january while prologis north american properties fund v s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that is able to raise capital in the public market  there can be no assurance that prologis north american properties fund v will have the available capital to acquire additional properties from prologis in or  if capital is available  that prologis north american properties fund v will want to use its capital to acquire properties from prologis 
further  there can be no assurance that prologis will offer to contribute additional properties to prologis north american properties fund v 
prologis ability to contribute or sell its development pipeline and recognize profits from its development activities will be jeopardized and prologis ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate distributable cash flow would be adversely affected should the existing equity commitments not be available due to investor default or otherwise such that these property funds can acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available for contribution 
this impact would occur in the short term and would continue until prologis is able to sell the properties to third parties or until prologis could secure another source of private equity capital to form a new property fund 
limitations on debt prologis currently has a policy of incurring debt only if upon such incurrence  prologis debt to book capitalization ratio  as adjusted  would not exceed 
the board could alter or eliminate this policy without shareholder approval and would do so if  for example  it were necessary in order for prologis to continue with its investment strategy or to continue to meet the reit requirements of the code 
if this policy were changed  prologis could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect its distributable cash flow 
debt financing prologis is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that prologis cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness  that such refinancing would be on terms as 
table of contents favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness  or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 
prologis utilizes the short term borrowing capabilities over billion as of december  provided by six credit agreements that provide revolving lines of credit facilities to prologis in addition to operating cash flow and proceeds from dispositions to fund its development  acquisition and distribution requirements 
prologis six revolving lines of credits expire through million of borrowing capacity expires during  million of borrowing capacity expires during  million of borrowing capacity expires during  million of borrowing capacity expires during 
these expiration dates consider extension periods that are at prologis option 
prologis ability to refinance these credit agreements in a timely manner and at favorable terms is dependent on several factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  prologis credit ratings and interest rate levels 
prologis short term credit agreements bear interest at variable rates 
increases in interest rates would increase prologis interest expense under these agreements 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of prologis distributable cash flow would be adversely affected 
requirements of credit agreements the terms of prologis various credit agreements and other indebtedness require prologis to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage 
these covenants may limit prologis flexibility in its operations  and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if prologis has satisfied its payment obligations 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of prologis distributable cash flow would be adversely affected 
federal income tax risks failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect shareholders prologis elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december  to maintain reit status  prologis must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis 
those requirements seek to ensure  among other things  that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related  that a reit distributes substantially all its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit s equity ownership is not overly concentrated 
due to the complex nature of these rules  the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules  the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law  administrative interpretations of the law and changes in prologis business  no assurance can be given that prologis will qualify as a reit for any particular year 
if prologis fails to qualify as a reit  it will be taxed as a regular corporation  and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing prologis taxable income 
the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce the distributable cash flow to prologis shareholders and funds available for reinvestment 
moreover  prologis might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which prologis ceased to qualify as a reit 
in addition  if prologis later requalified as a reit  it might be required to pay a full corporate level tax on any unrealized gains in its assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of non reit status 
in the absence of reit status  distributions to shareholders would no longer be required 
potential adverse effect of reit distribution requirements to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code  prologis must annually distribute to its shareholders at least of its reit taxable income  excluding the dividends paid deduction and its net capital gains 
this requirement limits prologis ability to accumulate capital 
prologis may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements 
difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for prologis funds or to timing differences 
table of contents between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements  because income may have to be reported before cash is received  because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited  or the internal revenue service may make a determination that adjusts reported income 
in those situations  prologis might be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements and interest and penalties could apply 
if prologis fails to make a required distribution  it would cease to be taxed as a reit 
prohibited transaction income could result from certain property transfers prologis contributes properties to property funds and sells properties to third parties 
some of these contributions and sales are made from prologis taxable subsidiaries 
under the code  if a disposition is deemed to be a prohibited transaction  a penalty tax on the resulting gain could be assessed 
the determination that a transaction constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction 
the internal revenue service could contend that certain contributions or sales of properties by prologis are prohibited transactions 
while prologis management does not believe that the internal revenue service would prevail in such a dispute  if the internal revenue service successfully argued the matter  the penalty tax could be assessed against the gains from these transactions 
additionally  any gain from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect prologis ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 
other risks prologis is dependent on key personnel prologis executive officers and other senior offices have a significant role in prologis success 
the ability of prologis to retain its management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave prologis is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market 
the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely effect prologis financial condition and cash flow 
further  such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 
share prices may be affected by market interest rates the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of such common shares 
an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate that prologis has set  which could adversely affect the value of prologis common shares 
foreign currency risk prologis has pursued and intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invests in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency 
as a result  prologis is subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar 
for example  a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where prologis has a significant investment may materially adversely affect prologis results of operations and the value of its common shares 
prologis attempts to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and by entering into derivative contracts  although there can be no assurance that such attempts will be successful 
government regulations and actions there are many laws and governmental regulations that are applicable to prologis  its unconsolidated investees and their properties 
changes in these laws and governmental regulations  or their interpretation by agencies or the courts  could occur 
further  economic and political factors  including civil unrest  governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders in the united states  but primarily in the foreign countries in which prologis has invested  can have a major impact on a global company such as prologis 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk prologis is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
prologis has used certain derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign currency put option contracts  to reduce its foreign currency market risk 
to a lesser extent  prologis has used interest rate swap agreements to reduce its interest rate market risk 
prologis does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with polices that have been approved by the board 
prologis has estimated its market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis 
prologis has defined its market risk exposure as i the potential loss in future earnings and cash flows due to interest rate exposure and ii the future loss in future earnings with respect to foreign currency exchange exposure 
prologis sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value 
as a result  prologis ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period  hedging strategies at the time  and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk prologis interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve its objective for longer term debt  prologis borrows on a fixed rate basis 
in anticipation of a financing expected to occur in  prologis entered into two forward starting interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the interest rate on a portion of the expected financing 
if the expected financing occurs in the projected time frame  any increase in interest rates would be offset by the positive value of the contracts and any decrease in interest rates would be offset by the negative value of the contracts  in each case for the hedged amount of the expected financing 
if the expected financing did not occur and the contracts were unwound  based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for the forward starting interest rate swap contracts would be approximately million for both future earnings and cash flows for the year ended december  prologis primary interest rate risk is created by its variable rate lines of credit 
during the year ended december   prologis had weighted average daily outstanding borrowings of million on its variable rate revolving lines of credit 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for prologis variable rate revolving lines of credit was approximately million for both future earnings and cash flows for the year ended december  the sensitivity analysis was based on the weighted average outstanding variable rate borrowings for and assumed a flat yield curve for the year 
although prologis has no derivative contracts as hedges of its variable rate revolving lines of credit  prologis may in the future fix existing variable rate borrowings to manage its interest rate exposure 
foreign currency risk prologis primarily uses foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the projected net operating income operating income net of foreign denominated interest expense of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees 
in addition  prologis incurs foreign currency exchange risk related to third party and intercompany debt of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and its foreign unconsolidated investees that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or investee 
the remeasurement of certain of this debt results in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses by prologis 
prologis primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the following currencies versus the us dollar euro  pound sterling and yen 
based on the results of a sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the estimated market risk exposure to future earnings associated with this debt was million at december  
table of contents prologis translates to us dollars the income and expenses of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries and its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of its unconsolidated investees recognized under the equity method 
prologis hedges the foreign currency exchange risk associated with approximately to of the forecasted net operating income from its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees through foreign currency put option contracts 
the effect of the change in foreign currency exchange rates on translated income and expenses of prologis foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees has a high degree of inverse correlation with the derivative instruments used to hedge it 
since prologis hedges approximately to of its projected net operating income from its foreign subsidiaries and investees  approximately to of the impact to the net earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and investees of an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would not be offset by derivative instruments 
the foreign currency put options are entered into on a quarterly basis such that prologis generally has twelve months of net operating income hedged at to of forecasted net operating income under the contracts 
assuming a increase and a decrease in foreign currency exchange rates for the sensitivity analysis  the estimated market risk exposure to future earnings for the foreign currency option contracts would be million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as the foreign currency put option contracts are paid in full at inception  the maximum charge to future earnings for the contracts themselves is limited to the prepaid premiums 
prologis has also entered into a foreign currency forward contract related to prologis investment in europe 
the contract allows prologis to sell euro at a fixed exchange rate to the us dollar with a maturity date of april  the contract was entered into in anticipation of a financing that is expected to occur in if the foreign currency forward contract were unwound prior to maturity  a sensitivity analysis that assumes a increase in the euro results in estimated market risk exposure for the foreign currency forward contract of approximately million to both future earnings and cash flows for the year ended december  fair value of financial instruments the following estimates of the fair value of financial instruments have been determined by prologis using available market information and valuation methodologies believed to be appropriate for these purposes 
considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and  accordingly  they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that prologis would realize upon disposition 
at december  and  the carrying amounts of certain financial instruments employed by prologis  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values due to the short term maturity of these instruments 
similarly  the carrying values of the revolving lines of credit balances outstanding approximate their fair values as of those dates since the interest rates on the revolving lines of credit are based on current market rates 
at december  and  the fair values of prologis senior unsecured debt  secured debt including mortgage notes and securitized debt and assessment bonds have been estimated based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities 
the differences in the fair values of prologis senior unsecured debt  secured debt and assessment bonds from the carrying values in the table below are the result of differences in the interest rates available to prologis at december  and from the interest rates that were in effect when the debt was issued 
the senior unsecured debt and many of the secured debt issues contain pre payment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt exceed the benefit that would be derived from refinancing at the lower rates 
at december  and  the fair values of prologis derivative financial instruments are the amounts at which they could be settled  based on quoted market prices or estimates obtained from brokers or dealers 
as prologis marks its derivative financial instruments to market  their fair values are the same as their carrying values 
the carry value of the foreign currency forward contract is included as other liabilities and the carrying values of the foreign currency put option contracts and the interest rate swap contracts are included as other assets in prologis consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents the following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of prologis financial instruments as of the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars december  carrying carrying value fair value value fair value senior unsecured debt secured debt and assessment bonds mortgage notes and securitized debt assessment bonds total secured debt and assessment bonds derivative financial instruments foreign currency put option contracts foreign currency forward contract interest rate swap contracts
