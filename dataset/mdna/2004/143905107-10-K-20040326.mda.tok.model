item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two types of businesses funeral homes  which account for approximately of our revenues  and cemeteries  which account for approximately of our revenues 
funeral homes are principally a service business that provide funeral services burial and cremation and sell related merchandise  such as caskets and urns 
cemeteries are primarily a sales business that sells real estate grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise such as markers and memorials 
as of february   we operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states 
substantially all administrative activities are conducted in our home office in houston  texas 
factors affecting our funeral operating results include the number of deaths in the markets we serve  whether we gain or lose market share relative to our competitors in the markets we operate  the price that we sell our services and merchandise  and the cost of providing services  primarily the salaries and benefits expense related to our professional and support staff  and the cost of merchandise 
in simple terms  volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenues 
the average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately less than average revenue earned from a traditional funeral service 
during each of the last three years  funeral revenue has decreased because we have sold funeral homes  the death rate has decreased year over year from to  lost market share in certain markets  and experienced an increasing number of cremation services at lower average revenue per service and nominal increase in the average revenue per burial service 
funeral homes have a high fixed cost structure  thus small changes in revenues  up or down  normally cause significant changes to our profitability 
during  we implemented several significant changes in our funeral operations designed to improve operating and financial results by growing market share and increasing profitability 
we introduced a more decentralized  entrepreneurial and local operating model 
at the same time  we introduced operating and financial standards developed from our best funeral operations 
the new operating model and standards focus on the key drivers of a successful funeral operation  organized around three primary areas market share  people and operating and financial metrics 
important elements of the new operating model and areas of focus during include a more balanced operating model that allows our funeral home managing partners to make local decisions guided by operating and financial standards based upon best practices of our best businesses 
incentives for our funeral home managing and regional partners aligned with our standards that give our partners the opportunity to be compensated at close to the same level as if they owned the business 
a renewed focus on having the right local leadership in place to execute the new operating model 
changes to our cycle of service model to ensure that we build a meaningful and lasting relationship with each client family 
improvements in the presentation and packaging of our services and merchandise 
we are also reworking our supplier arrangements to improve our merchandise selection and margins 
targeted reviews of our systems and support services to improve effectiveness and decrease overhead costs 
the cemetery operating results are affected by the size and success of our sales organization because approximately of our cemetery revenues relate to sales of grave sites and mausoleums and related merchandise before the time of need 
we believe the low level of consumer confidence a measure of whether consumers will spend for discretionary items during the last three years has limited the growth of cemetery revenues 
approximately of our cemetery revenues are attributable to investment earnings on trust funds and finance charges on installment contracts 
weaknesses in the equity markets and declining interest rates have had a negative affect on this component of our cemetery revenues 
cash flow from operations and from the sales of businesses during the last three years have provided us the funds to reduce our debt and contingent purchase obligations by million since december  lower debt and declining interest rates have allowed us to incur lower interest expense during the three year period ending december  our focus during will be to continue to improve our financial condition by paying down debt  improve the market share and profitability of our funeral homes  and increase the preneed sales of cemetery property 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be sustained consistently from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral merchandise and services when the funeral service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenue from the sales of cemetery merchandise and services are recognized in the period in which the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
revenues to be recognized from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by the company and are likely to exceed the cash collected from the contract and received from the trust at maturity 
allowances for customer cancellations  refunds and bad debts are provided at the date of sale based on our historical experience 
in addition  we monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is typically one year after the policy is issued 
preneed funeral contracts deferred preneed funeral contracts revenue cash proceeds from preneed funeral sales are deposited to a trust or to purchase of a third party insurance product 
unperformed guaranteed preneed funeral contracts are included in the consolidated balance sheets as preneed funeral contracts 
the balance in this asset account represents amounts due from customer receivables and third party insurance companies  and the amounts deposited with the trustee and the accumulated earnings on these deposits 
a corresponding credit is recorded to deferred preneed funeral contracts revenue 
the funeral revenue is not recorded until the service is performed 
the trust income earned and the increases in insurance benefits on the insurance products are also deferred until the service is performed  in order to offset inflation in cost to provide the service in the future 
deferred obtaining costs deferred obtaining costs consist of sales commissions and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts 
these costs are deferred and amortized into funeral and cemetery costs and expenses as the services and merchandise are expected to be delivered 
effective october   we changed from the straight line amortization method to an actuarial method that more closely matches the expected maturity of the preneed contracts 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired  as determined by management in transactions accounted for as purchases  is recorded as goodwill 
many of the acquired funeral homes have provided high quality service to families for generations 
the resulting loyalty often represents a substantial portion of the value of a funeral business 
goodwill is typically not associated with or recorded for the cemetery businesses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually on a regional basis to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that this intangible asset might be carried in excess of fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the businesses in each region at the company s weighted average cost of capital less debt allocable to the region and by reference to recent sales transactions of similar businesses 
the calculation of fair value can vary dramatically with changes in estimates of the number of future services performed  inflation in costs and the company s cost of capital  which is impacted by long term interest rates 
if impairment is indicated  then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill to fair value 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return and separate returns as required in certain states where we operate 
we record a provision for income taxes based upon an estimated effective tax rate that considers the federal and states statutory tax rates and any permanent differences such as the federal deduction of state taxes  nondeductible expenses and nonreportable income 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance would be recorded if it is determined that the realization of a deferred tax asset is uncertain 
each quarter the allowance is reviewed and adjusted if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
accounting changes and recently issued accounting standards a goodwill and other intangible assets in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination at acquisition 
sfas no 
addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
this statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of the beginning of the first quarter of the effect of sfas no 
on the company is the elimination of the amortization of goodwill  which prior to was amortized over years  and the testing for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis 
had the adoption of sfas no 
occurred at the beginning of the previous year  the results would have been as follows in thousands  except per share amounts for the year ended december  income before taxes  net income  diluted earnings per share b impairment of long lived assets in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting of long lived assets  other than goodwill  that are to be held and used or disposed by sale or otherwise  and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted sfas no 
in which had no effect on the company s results of operations 
c gains and losses from extinguishment of debt in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other provisions  sfas no 
rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
accordingly  gains or losses from extinguishment of debt shall not be reported as extraordinary items unless the extinguishment qualifies as an extraordinary item under the criteria of apb no 
gains and losses from extinguishment of debt that do not meet the criteria of apb no 
should be reclassified to income from continuing operations in all prior periods presented 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the company adopted sfas no 
when it reported the results for the year and reclassified extraordinary items previously reported  which represented losses on the early extinguishment of debt  to interest expense 
d costs associated with disposal activities in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
previous guidance  provided under emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  required an exit cost liability to be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement were effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated by a company after december  the company adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of  which has had no impact because no exit or disposed activities occurred in e stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement was effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in the first quarter report on form q in the company accounts for stock options and shares issued pursuant to its employee stock purchase plan under apb opinion no 
 under which no compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the difference between the two acceptable methods of accounting is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
f consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 

this interpretation clarifies the application of arb  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity and risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in december  the fasb revised fasb interpretation no 
fin r which allows companies with certain types of variable interest entities to defer implementation until march  we are currently in discussions with the staff of the securities and exchange commission related to the implementation of fin r 
the discussions relate to whether we should consolidate the preneed funeral trusts  preneed cemetery trusts and the cemetery perpetual care trusts  and  if we are to consolidate these trusts  when would we recognize the associated earnings of the trusts 
currently  we defer investment earnings associated with prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery merchandise and service trust funds until the corresponding merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
it is unclear at this time whether this revenue recognition policy will continue upon implementation of fin r  or if we will have to recognize these trust fund earnings in a revised manner  such as at the time the trust funds themselves earn such investment earnings 
realized distributable investment earnings from cemetery perpetual care trust funds are currently recognized in cemetery revenues as they are intended to defray cemetery maintenance costs 
we expect to continue recognizing these investment earnings under this new accounting policy 
the company will implement the provisions of fin r as of march  and currently expects to consolidate into its balance sheet the preneed funeral  preneed cemetery and perpetual care trusts at fair value  which would have the effect of increasing trust assets and total assets by approximately million 
the offsetting credit is expected to be recorded in deferred revenue or as a component of stockholders equity 
the ultimate resolution of the accounting for the associated trust income has not been determined and could potentially result in a material change as to when the trust earnings are recognized 
the company has not been able to quantify the impact  if any  at this time 
selected income and operational data the following table sets forth certain income statement data for carriage expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods presented year ended december  total revenues  net total gross profit general and administrative expenses operating income  excluding special charges interest expense  net the following table sets forth the number of funeral homes and cemeteries owned and operated by carriage for the periods presented year ended december  funeral homes at beginning of period acquisitions or openings divestitures  mergers or closures of existing funeral homes funeral homes at end of period cemeteries at beginning of period acquisitions divestitures cemeteries at end of period the following is a discussion of carriage s results of operations for   and the term same store or existing operations refers to funeral homes and cemeteries owned and operated for the entirety of each period being compared 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  funeral home segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from our funeral home operations during the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands total same store revenue    acquired  sold and discontinued    preneed insurance commissions revenue   total revenues    gross profit same store gross profit    acquired  sold and discontinued preneed insurance commissions revenue   total gross profit    funeral same store revenues for the year ended december  were less when compared to the year ended december   as we experienced a decrease of in the number of funeral service contracts from  to  and an increase of in the average revenue per contract from  to  for those existing operations 
the decline in the number of funeral service contracts of was due  we believe  in part to the decline in the number of deaths of in compared to based on statistics published by the center of disease control  as adjusted for non reporting cities 
we also believe that we lost market share in certain areas based on our analysis of obituary reports for those markets 
approximately of the funeral services were cremation services compared to in the average revenue per cremation services increased compared to the change in mix from traditional to cremation services resulted in a decline of million in revenue for compared to of the funeral services performed during and  approximately and  respectively  were previously prearranged 
though funeral revenues declined by million  funeral costs and expenses actually increased by million  resulting in a decline in gross profit of million 
from an operational perspective  the funeral business is a relatively fixed cost business 
if variable costs had remained constant as a percentage of net revenues  the million reduction in revenue would have been associated with a reduction in cost of approximately million to million 
the negative cost and expense variance is due primarily to increases in merchandise costs  bad debts and property casualty and general liability insurance 
merchandise costs were approximately million higher as vendors increased their prices to carriage at the beginning of at a rate higher than the company was able to increase its prices to the public 
bad debts were million higher than because the company realized some significant recoveries from a centralized collection process installed in property casualty and general liability insurance costs increased million due to higher premium costs and claims 
cemetery segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from cemetery operations for the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands total same store revenue and total net revenues   total same store gross profit and total gross profit   no cemetery businesses were acquired or sold during the two years 
the higher cemetery net revenues resulted in part from a million increase in at need revenues as a result of an increase in the average value per contract of from to  though the volume of at need contracts declined from  to  we also experienced an increase in preneed property sales of million primarily the result of a increase in the number of preneed contracts written from  to  the average preneed contract value declined from  to  these increases were offset in part by million less trust income and million less in deliveries of previously prearranged merchandise and services 
cemetery gross profit increased on a year over year basis primarily due to million less bad debt expense in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased slightly from lower million lease expense from the buyout of a computer lease obligation in early was mitigated in part by higher million depreciation expense 
higher overall salaries and wages in offset the million officer termination cost in higher legal fees and franchise taxes in totaling million compared to million incurred for professional fees related to a change in tax accounting methods 
the following table describes the components of special charges and other items of the company for the years ended december  and december  december  amount s diluted eps impact amount s diluted eps impact net gains losses from the dispositions impairments of business assets costs of early terminations of lease obligation and bank credit facility total special charges and other items interest expense and other financing costs for the year ended december  declined million compared to the year ended cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sales of business assets have provided the source of funds to reduce the debt outstanding during and since december   total outstanding debt has been reduced by million 
reductions in interest rates over the last two years and the expiration of a floating for fixed interest rate swap in may also contributed to a lesser degree in reducing interest expense 
income taxes the company recorded income taxes at the effective rate of excluding the affect of the change in valuation allowance and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million for federal income tax purposes  as well as significant operating loss carryforwards in certain states 
because of the ability to use the net operating loss to offset taxable income and the timing of when revenue and expenses are recognized for tax purposes  we did not pay federal income taxes in and the slightly lower tax rate in  compared to  is based on the utilization of certain state loss carryforwards  a portion of the benefits of which have not yet been recognized 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  funeral home segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from our funeral home operations during the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands total same store revenue   acquired  sold and closed    preneed insurance commissions revenue    total net revenues    gross profit same store gross    acquired  sold and closed preneed insurance commissions revenue    total gross profit    funeral same store revenues for the year ended december  increased when compared to the year ended december   as we experienced an increase of in the number of services and an increase of in the average revenue per service for those existing operations 
the increase in the average revenue per service was hampered by an increase from to in the percentage of funeral services involving cremations  which generally have a lower sales value 
the average revenue for cremation services increased from year to year 
in addition to the net revenues from funeral location operations above  insurance commission revenues from preneed funeral contract sales totaled million for  as compared to million for  primarily due to nonrecurring commissions in the prior year period on the conversion of trust funded contracts to insurance funded contracts 
total funeral same store gross profit for the year ended december  increased million or from the comparable year of the higher gross profit is primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization which totaled million during the year ended december  cemetery segment 
the following sets forth certain information regarding carriage s net revenues and gross profit from cemetery operations for the years ended december  and year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands total same store revenue    acquired or sold total net revenues    same store gross profit   acquired or sold total gross profit   not meaningful cemetery same store net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  over the year ended december   and cemetery same store gross profit decreased million  or  over the comparable year of no cemetery locations were sold or discontinued in sales of property merchandise and services on an at need basis increased from million in to million in preneed cemetery sales have been negatively affected by the weak economy and internal challenges in restaffing the preneed sales group 
in particular  we experienced a decrease in preneed sales of interment and entombment sites from million to  and a decrease of million in finance charges earned on preneed receivables 
income from trust funds was substantially the same in both years 
total gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  gross margin in the current year period benefited by a lower bad debt experience 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  these expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from to primarily because of a million charge related to the termination of an employment agreement with a former officer and million in professional fees incurred in connection with changes in tax accounting methods during excluding these two unusual charges  general and administrative expenses totaled of net revenues 
higher salaries and benefits accounted for the remaining increase in year over year expenses 
interest expense and other financing costs for the year ended december  declined slightly compared to the year ended december  primarily because average debt outstanding was less than the average debt outstanding in the same period for additional amortization in the amount of million was recorded in because of the reduction in the maximum principal available under the company s revolving credit facility from million to million and paydowns on the senior notes 
income taxes the following table sets forth the components of the provision benefit of income taxes for the company for the years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  amount percent of pretax income amount percent of pretax income provision for income taxes before the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance   reduction of deferred tax asset valuation allowance  total provision benefit for income taxes   see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes for these years 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  and million at december  it is carriage s practice to apply available cash balances against its revolving line of credit to minimize interest expense 
if the company needs cash for working capital or investment purposes  it can draw upon available capacity under its million revolving line of credit  such availability being million as of december  for the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the million decrease is primarily due to the million decrease in net income  adjusted for deferred taxes 
the deferral of the tides distributions discussed in the following section provided million of cash flow from operations 
uses of working capital for accounts receivable and trust funds totaled million for compared to million for cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in investing activities in the amount of million for december   the change being primarily due to the million receipt of cash in related to an adjustment to the purchase cost of a acquisition versus a use of million for acquisitions in cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in financing activities in the amount of million for december   most of which was used for debt reduction 
debt the company s debt at december  totaled million and consisted of million in senior notes  a million revolving credit facility million outstanding at december  and million in acquisition indebtedness and capital lease obligations 
additionally  the company has used million of the credit facility for letters of credit  the majority of which secures arrangements with the company s insurance provider 
carriage replaced the million credit facility that was in place at december  with a million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in march interest is payable at either prime rate or libor options 
initially  the libor option is set at libor plus basis points and the margin above libor can decline in the future with reductions in carriage s debt to ebitda ratio  if any  as defined in the credit agreement 
the new credit facility reduces by million in march  and by an additional million in september in addition  the commitment under the credit facility reduces by up to million for the banks pro rata share of proceeds from dispositions of assets  if any 
in order to comply with the conditions of the new credit facility  the company began deferring interest payments on the subordinated debentures held by its affiliated trust 
as a result  cash distributions on the company obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of carriage services capital trust were deferred for at least the term of the new credit facility beginning with the september  payment 
the senior notes are unsecured  mature in traunches of million in  million in and million in and bear interest at the fixed rates of  and  respectively 
the senior note agreement additionally requires that a significant portion of any proceeds from the sales of assets be offered to the note holders as prepayment of the amounts outstanding 
these prepayments are made at par value 
prepayments were made in the amounts of million  million and million during  and  respectively  related to the proceeds from sales of assets 
the credit facility is unsecured and contains customary restrictive covenants  including a restriction on the payment of dividends on common stock  and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios 
the company met all financial covenants at december  as of december   the company s debt to total capitalization was percent as compared to percent at december  we do not have any liquidity sources or financing arrangements with unconsolidated or limited purpose entities in which we may be economically or legally required or reasonably likely to fund losses  provide it with additional funding  issue securities pursuant to a call option held by that entity  purchase the entity s capital stock or assets  or otherwise may be financially affected by the performance or non performance of an entity or counterparty to a transaction or arrangement 
in particular  we do not expect to be required to fund any unrealized or realized losses in the preneed trust funds 
preferred stock the company s subsidiary  carriage services capital trust  has issued and outstanding  units of convertible preferred securities  that mature in  resulting in approximately million of proceeds that are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets as company obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of carriage services capital trust tides 
distributions are tax deductible and may be deferred at our option for up to consecutive quarters 
for purposes of debt ratios  under our revolving credit and senior note agreements  the convertible preferred securities are treated as equity 
since the company has deferred the tides distributions  current payments have not been made to holders since september  during the period in which distribution payments are deferred  distributions will continue to accumulate at the percent annual rate 
also  the deferred distributions will themselves accumulate distributions at the annual rate of percent 
during the period in which distributions are deferred  carriage is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock or repurchasing its common stock  with limited exceptions 
the deferred distributions become due in full at the earlier of the date that the company elects to reume paying distributions or september  significant uses of cash the company markets preneed funeral contracts and a cash investment has been required to generate this backlog of business  primarily to fund sales commissions and other selling expenses 
in  million of preneed funeral sales were generated for a cash outlay of million 
in  million of preneed sales were generated for a cash outlay of million 
in  million of preneed funeral sales were generated for a cash outlay of million 
during the twelve months ended december   the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily related to refurbishing and improving funeral home facilities and construction of lawn crypts and mausoleums at cemeteries 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility should be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures as well as other ongoing operating requirements 
the company anticipates that the capital expenditures in will primarily be limited to those that are required to maintain the revenue capability of its existing businesses 
it does not anticipate making significant capital expenditures to grow or enhance new revenue streams or acquire new businesses 
obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  as well as other financial commitments 
where appropriate we have indicated the footnote to our annual consolidated financial statements where additional information is available 
payments by period note reference total after years in millions long term debt capital lease obligations mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities dividends payable on convertible preferred securities operating leases noncompete agreements total contractual cash obligations mature in we expect to retire the series a maturities of senior notes due in july outstanding balance of million at december  using funds available from our unsecured credit facility 
at december   the company had approximately million of available borrowings on its million commitment under the credit facility 
we believe that cash flow from operations and proceeds from planned disposals of certain locations will generate sufficient funds through july to pay down the unsecured credit facility to a level that will create sufficient credit capacity to retire the series a maturities 
however  if events or circumstances beyond the company s control result in insufficient available credit capacity  the credit facility contains a provision whereby the company may increase the commitment available under its credit facility to million  thus increasing the available borrowings by an additional million 
the company believes that additional debt and equity financing may be required in the future to fund capital needs and longer term debt maturities 
the availability and terms of these capital sources will depend on prevailing market conditions  interest rates and the then existing financial condition of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements as of december  consist of our preneed arrangements which are discussed in sections preneed funeral contracts and deferred preneed funeral contracts revenue  amounts due from preneed cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and perpetual and memorial care trust of note to the consolidated financial statements included in item related party transactions as an incentive  the company entered into arrangements with one of its directors and a current director nominee to pay them each of the amount by which the annual field level cash flow exceeds predetermined targets on certain businesses in their respective geographic region through  with a final payment equal to a multiple of six times the average of the last three years payments 
the business purpose of the arrangements was to incentivise the individuals to provide carriage with high quality acquisition targets and to have input in the competitive strategies of those businesses post acquisition so that cash flows grow over time 
the terms were determined by reference to similar arrangements within the death care industry 
the incentives earned by the two individuals totaled approximately   and  for the years  and  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of two funeral homes from a group of individuals  one of which is one of the directors referred to in the preceding paragraph  a portion of the purchase price of each of those funeral homes was to be payable based on a formula related to the annual field level cash flows subsequent to the year of acquisition 
the business purpose was to determine the final purchase prices of the acquisitions since both were expected to show strong growth in cash flow 
the terms were negotiated by the sellers  one of which later was appointed to director of carriage 
the contingent purchase price payments paid to the director totaled  and  during the years and  respectively 
the company rents office space  at an annual rate of  per year through  from an entity in which one of the company s directors has a financial interest 
the terms were determined by reference to rentals of similar office space in the area 
the company was reimbursed for the cost of personnel and office expenses totaling approximately  from an entity in which the company owns a minority interest and one of the entity s directors is our chief executive officer 
in connection with the production of the company s annual report  printing costs of approximately  were paid to an entity in which one of the company s directors is the chief executive officer 
such services were competitively bid and the amount paid represents a market cost of the services 
seasonality although the death care business is relatively stable and fairly predictable  our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate 
generally  death rates are higher during the winter months 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the results of carriage s operations 
forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report contains forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include any projections of earnings  revenues  asset sales  cash flow  debt levels or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operation  any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
forward looking statements may include the words may  will  estimate  intend  believe  expect  project  forecast  plan  anticipate and other similar words 
cautionary statements we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to our business earnings from and principal of trust funds and insurance contracts could be reduced by changes in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates 
earnings and investment gains and losses on trust funds and insurance contracts are affected by financial market conditions that are not within our control 
earnings are also affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities that we choose to maintain in the funds  and we may not choose the optimal mix for any particular market condition 
the size of the funds depends upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
declines in earnings from perpetual care trust funds would cause a decline in current revenues  while declines in earnings from other trust funds and insurance contracts could cause a decline in future cash flows and revenues 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of december   net unrealized depreciation in the funeral trust fund was million 
unrealized gains in the cemetery merchandise and perpetual care trust funds amounted to million  million  respectively 
see note in our consolidated financial statements 
unrealized gains and losses in the funeral trust funds and cemetery merchandise trust funds have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the fair market value of the funds were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services 
if that were to occur  we would record a charge to earnings to record the expected loss currently 
over time  gains and losses realized in the funds are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of the trust fund earnings to be recognized when we deliver the underlying product or service 
accordingly  if current market conditions do not improve  the funds may eventually realize losses  and our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue when we deliver the underlying products and services 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see note increased costs may have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
cost increases may impair our ability to achieve revenue growth that exceeds our cost increases 
our plan assumes that we will be successful in increasing revenues at a rate that is greater than the growth in the cost of sales 
although we believe we can achieve that goal  we can give no assurance that we will be successful in doing so in we expect insurance costs  in particular  to remain high or increase in the volume of claims made over the past two years resulted in liquidity challenges that many insurers have passed on to their policyholders 
additionally  insurers have increased premiums to offset losses in equity and debt markets due to recent economic conditions 
while our insurance costs are expected to remain high or increase  any actual increase in insurance costs cannot be predicted 
our ability to achieve our debt reduction targets and to service our debt in the future depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash  which depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to achieve our debt reduction targets in the time frame projected by us depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash from two main sources disposing of underperforming assets and locations  and our ongoing operations 
we expect to generate cash proceeds from disposing of assets and locations which depends upon our ability to negotiate transactions on acceptable terms and conditions with qualified buyers who can obtain third party financing 
our ability to generate cash flow from operations depends upon  among other things  the number of deaths in our markets  competition  the level of preneed sales and their maturities  our ability to control our costs  stock and bond market conditions  and general economic  financial and regulatory factors  most of which is beyond our control 
we may experience declines in preneed sales due to numerous factors ranging from changes to sales force compensation to a weakening economy 
declines in preneed sales would reduce our backlog and revenue and could reduce our future market share 
in an effort to enhance our local preneed sales strategies  we are evaluating new insurance products  marketing strategies and the compensation structure for our preneed sales force 
although we anticipate changes in these areas could improve preneed sales  we could experience declines in preneed sales in the short run 
in addition  a weakening economy that causes customers to have less discretionary income could cause a decline in preneed sales 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales would reduce current revenue  and declines in other preneed sales would reduce our backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share 
increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on cash flow 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sales proceeds required to be placed into trust or escrow and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
in fiscal year  we changed the terms and conditions of preneed sales contracts and commissions and moderated our preneed sales effort in order to reduce the initial negative impact on cash flow 
nevertheless  we will continue to invest a portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow will be further reduced  and our ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
price competition could reduce market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products 
in the past  this price competition has resulted in losing market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices thereby reducing profit margins in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and the backlog 
increased advertising or better marketing by competitors  or increased activity by competitors offering products or services over the internet  could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased costs in order to retain or recapture our market share 
in recent years  marketing through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased with respect to the sales of preneed funeral services 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to increase marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs in response to competition to vary the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause us to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on our variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share 
as of december   million of our long term debt was subject to variable interest rates 
accordingly  any significant increase in interest rates  could increase our interest costs on our variable rate long term debt  which could decrease our net income and earnings per share 
covenant restrictions under our revolving credit facility and senior notes limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our revolving credit facility and the senior notes contain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets  and create liens on assets 
we must also stay within specified limits of financial ratios  such as a debt to ebitda ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio 
we expect to borrow from our revolving credit facility in july to retire the series a maturities of senior notes 
in the event we are not in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit facility we could be prevented from drawing on our credit facility to retire the senior notes 
this would constitute an event of default and our lenders could elect to declare all amounts immediately due and payable 
our projections for include adjustments to earnings and cash flow for estimated disposition activity 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate dispositions 
our projections for include adjustments to earnings and cash flow for estimated disposition activity 
the actual level of disposition activity  if any  will depend not only on the number of properties sold  but also on the size of the businesses sold 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate sales 
we may not be able to find a sufficient number of buyers at prices we are willing to sell 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline  which could decrease revenues 
although studies estimate that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year to  longer lifespans could reduce the rate of deaths  and appear to be doing so currently 
for example  data obtained from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc indicate a decrease in deaths in the united states of percent during our fiscal year ended december   compared to the same period in the prior year 
in addition  changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
our comparisons of the change in the number of families served to the change in the number of deaths reported by the cdc from time to time may not necessarily be meaningful 
the cdc receives weekly mortality reports from cities and metropolitan areas in the united states within two to three weeks from the date of death and reports the total number of deaths occurring in these areas each week based on the reports received from state health departments 
the comparability of our funeral calls to the cdc data is limited  as reports from the state health departments are often delayed  and the cities reporting to the cdc are not necessarily comparable with the markets in which we operate 
nonetheless  we believe that the cdc data is the most comprehensive data of this kind available 
the increasing number of cremations in the united states could cause revenues to decline because we could lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lesser funeral revenues and  in certain cases  lesser profit margins than traditional funerals 
our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately percent of the united states burial market by the year  compared to approximately in the trend toward cremation could cause cemeteries and traditional funeral homes to lose market share and revenues to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations with no funeral service  casket  urn  mausoleum niche  columbarium niche or burial produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues than traditional funerals and  when delivered at a traditional funeral home  produce lower profit margins as well 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
during the last three years  we have implemented new product and service strategies based on results of customer surveys that we conduct on a continuous basis 
however  we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
companies in the funeral home and cemetery business must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the federal trade commission  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations or facing costly and burdensome investigations from regulatory authorities  regardless of the merit thereof 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
in november  legislation was proposed that  if adopted  would more heavily regulate the death care industry 
if adopted  this legislation could result in an increase in our costs 
several states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of operations and our future prospects

item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure carriage is exposed to market risk primarily related to potential increases in interest rates related to the company s debt and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
carriage monitors current and forecasted interest rate risk incurred in the ordinary course of business and seeks to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
carriage strives to obtain the optimal cost of capital through a diverse range of funding alternatives and a mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
as of december   approximately of senior debt approximately of all interest bearing obligations are fixed rate obligations 
given the current outlook for increasing interest rates  we believe the current bias to fixed rate debt is appropriate 
our floating rate long term borrowings consist of the million outstanding under our million floating rate line of credit 
any change in the floating rate will cause a change in interest expense 
for example  each increase in the libor of would increase interest expense by million per year based on the current outstanding balance 
the remainder of carriage s long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  or otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease 
the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of carriage services capital trust pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on the company s balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
these securities have a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively  based on available broker quotes 
while these securities are very thinly traded  increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these securities to decrease but such changes will not affect the company s interest costs 
securities subject to market risk consist of investments held by our preneed funeral  cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care trust funds 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the estimate of the fair values of those securities
