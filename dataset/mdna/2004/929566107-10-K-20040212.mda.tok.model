item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  and our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to reposition the company 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operations segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our new credit facility  and contractual commitments 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made which we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements which we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
the company has two reportable segments manufacturing and retail and distribution 
the manufacturing segment produces trailers which are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and distribution segment 
the retail and distribution segment includes the sale and leasing of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through its retail branch network 
executive summary the north american trailer industry rebounded in after three consecutive years of declining demand for new trailer units 
the trucking industry confronting an economic downturn  dramatic increases in fuel  insurance  labor and epa compliances cost and weak capitalization reduced trailer purchases from a high of approximately  in to approximately  units in  a decline in demand 
demand recovered to approximately  units in  which as an annual rate approximates the industry replacement rate 
during the last three years  our market share of new trailers declined from in to in in response to the significant industry deterioration  we implemented a comprehensive plan to scale our operations to meet demand and to survive 
actions included changed senior management  rationalized manufacturing capacity closing two plants  reduced manufacturing cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives that focused on safety  quality  productivity  and product and process standardization  reduced used trailer inventories from approximately million or  units as of september to million or  units as of december   resolved legacy trade practices reducing open trade commitments to approximately million as of december  divested our european operations  rationalized retail and distribution capacity closing locations  and improved working capital management 
these actions resulting in net losses of million in  million in and million in  set the stage for selling certain assets of our rental and leasing business and our wholesale parts business  former branch properties and a large portion of our finance portfolio proceeds totaling approximately million used to reduce on and off balance sheet debt  refinancing our debt through the sale of million of senior unsecured convertible notes and the completion of a three year million bank facility extended required repayment terms and significantly reducing interest rates  continuing the streamlining of the retail and distribution organization closing locations  and achieving manufacturing margins exceeding those attained in  the recent high point of the production cycle 
charges totaling approximately million were incurred in connection with those initiatives 
entering  we believe that wabash is well positioned to fully participate in improving general and trucking industry conditions 
operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety  quality  productivity and cost reduction 
our objective  be better tomorrow than we are today  is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety 
we have achieved a four fold improvement in the total reportable incident rate since june  our safety metrics have improved each quarter for six straight quarters 
we believe improved safety translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time missed due to injuries 
quality 
we measure our quality performance in terms of first pass yield how many units pass all inspection criteria without requiring rework our first pass yield metrics have improved from to during on time delivery are we meeting our delivery commitments to customers in the third quarter of  we attained and continue to operate at that rate 
warranty we measure  among other things  the number and severity of warranty claims 
while improvements are being noted and we are encouraged by the results  a longer term perspective is required before declaring success 
productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements in these areas translate into increased availability capacity which we estimated to be over  units annually based on a three shift  five day work week 
reduced work in process inventory which is currently million compared to million at the beginning of the year 
increased inventory turnover which is currently about nine turns per year compared to approximately six turns in cost reduction 
during  we introduced our continuous improvement initiative ci 
as of december  we believe ci has become a way of life 
since introduction  over ci events have been completed 
industry trends to monitor the state of the industry we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and to the transportation industry 
information is obtained from sources such as act research co  llc act  american trucking association ata  cass logistics  and eno transportation foundation 
trends we are currently seeing include improvement in the number of units shipped by the us trailer industry 
after reaching a high of over  units shipped in  shipments declined to approximately  units in unit shipments were approximately  in and act is estimating that shipments will be approximately  units 
increasing age of motor carrier trailer fleets 
for the three year period to  the average age of trailer fleets have increased from approximately months to months as many motor carriers have deferred purchases 
this trend suggests to us that there is a pent up replacement demand for trailers 
increasing rate of new trailer orders 
quarterly industry order placements have been in the  to  units range for the last six quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  the rate was approximately  units 
other developments and our view of their potential impact on the industry include emission standards could result in improved demand for trailers in  and part of in advance of motor carriers focusing capital spending on tractors in advance of the regulations going into effect 
a similar pattern occurred in advance of the october enactment of emission standards 
technology advances in trailer tracking and route management implemented by motor carriers are improving trailer utilization and lower trailer to tractor ratios and could result in reduced trailer demand 
federal hours of service rules became effective january  based on the assessment of a large truck load carrier these will negatively impact driver productivity 
in our view  this could result in increased demand for trailers but it is too early to confirm 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales loss on asset impairment gross profit loss general and administrative expense selling expense restructuring charge loss from operations interest expense trade receivables facility costs foreign exchange losses  net equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliate restructuring charge loss on extinguishment other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit net loss includes used trailer valuation charges of million and million for loss contingencies 
includes used trailer inventory valuation charges of million  a restructuring related charge of million  and loss contingencies related to the company s leasing operations of million 
compared to net sales net sales improved from base upon act data  the first quarter of is believed to have been the low point of the industry downturn that began in by business segment  net external sales and related units sold were as follows dollars in millions years ended december  change net sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailer units manufacturing   retail and distribution   total   used trailer units   the manufacturing segment s sales improvement was driven by demand for new trailers and improved product mix 
average selling price increased primarily due to product mix for example  we sold approximately  fewer lower priced containers and chassis in compared to the decrease in the retail and distribution segment s net sales reflects used trailer sales decline of million as unit sales fell due to completing the disposition of excess inventories during and the impact of closing certain locations  the sale of certain assets of the aftermarket parts distribution business and the trailer rental and leasing business in september primarily accounts for million of the sales decline  branch parts and services sales decline of million primarily due to closing full service branches  offset by new trailer sales increase of million due to a increase in equivalent store units sold  offset partially by the impact of closing certain locations 
gross profit loss gross profit as a percent of sales was for compared to in  before asset impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
the asset impairment charge was taken on certain assets of the rental and leasing and aftermarket parts businesses 
a summary of gross profit by segment follows in millions years ended december  change gross profit loss by segment manufacturing retail and distribution eliminations total gross profit the manufacturing segment s gross profit increased due to higher volumes and improved product mix  coupled with realizing cost savings driven by our continuous improvement initiatives 
the segment s gross profit percentage of exceeded the attained in  the most recent production cycle peak 
the retail and distribution segment s gross profit for was negatively impacted by the million asset impairment charge and million in trailer valuation charges 
gross profit for was negatively impacted by million in loss contingencies and asset impairment charges related to equipment held for lease and million in used trailer valuation charges 
additionally  the lower gross profit resulted from lower margins on used trailer sales and the impact of selling certain assets of the rental and leasing and aftermarket parts businesses in september new trailers margins held steady in relation to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for  compared to million for the same period in the expense included million in debt restructuring costs  million related to the branch closings  offset in part by a million recovery of vat taxes 
the expense included million in bad debt expense mainly related to the finance and leasing businesses  million in severance accruals  million in write downs related to the disposition of the company s airplane and million in debt restructuring costs 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in the decrease primarily reflects the impact of retail branch closings and the september sale of certain assets of our trailer rental and leasing and aftermarket parts businesses 
other income expense interest expense totaled million for  a decrease of million from the prior year 
through the first three quarters of  interest expense exceeded that of due to higher interest rates and increased amortization of debt costs resulting from debt restructurings in and the debt refinancing and assets sales during the second half of resulted in lower interest rates and average borrowings  respectively 
trade receivables facility costs declined as included million in facility restructuring costs 
foreign exchange gains and losses  net were gains of million for  primarily occurring in the first six months of the year reflecting a strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
loss on debt extinguishment of million in primarily represents the additional costs associated with the early extinguishment of the company s senior series notes and bank debt 
other  net for was a net expense of million compared to a net income of million for the same period in the period included a million loss on the sale of a large portion of the company s finance portfolio  million charge for the settlement of a legacy roadrailer r transaction and a million loss on the sale of certain assets  offset in part by gains of million on the sale of closed branch properties 
the period included gains on the sale of closed branch properties 
income taxes the company recorded no income tax benefit in due to uncertainties surrounding the realizability of benefits associated with nols 
the benefit recorded represents an additional realizable federal nol carry back claim filed and received under the provisions of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which revised the permitted carry back period for nols generated during from two years to five years 
compared to net loss for was million compared to million in this improvement reflects a leveling off of new trailer sales and the impact on restructuring charges and losses related to used trailers 
net sales the company finished with consolidated net sales of approximately million compared to million in this decrease was the result of lower net sales in both the manufacturing and retail and distribution segments 
years ended december  change dollar amounts in millions net external sales by segment manufacturing retail and distribution total new trailer units manufacturing   retail and distribution   total   used trailer units   the manufacturing segment s net external sales decreased million in compared to primarily driven by a decrease in the average selling price per new trailer sold from approximately  in to approximately  in  reflecting a product mix that included approximately  units of lower priced containers and chassis 
the selling price per unit in for non container units was approximately  the retail and distribution segment s net external sales decreased million in compared to this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in new units 
the decrease in new units sold reflects market conditions and the company s focus on reducing used trailer inventories 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in used units sold and the selling price per new unit approximately  in versus  in 
the company s emphasis on reducing used trailer inventory resulted in a decrease in revenues per unit from approximately  in to  in the total number of branch locations as of december  was as compared to as of december  gross profit loss the company finished with gross profit loss as a percent of sales of on a consolidated basis as compared to in as discussed below  both of the company s segments contributed to this increase 
years ended december  change dollar amounts in millions gross profit loss by segment manufacturing retail and distribution eliminations total gross profit loss the manufacturing segment s gross profit loss increased primarily as a result of the following factors decrease of in material costs per unit resulting from product mix including containers and continuous improvement initiatives introduced in the second half of  new and used trailer inventory valuation adjustments of million in compared to million in  and the impact of inventory write downs related to the company s restructuring actions of approximately million  partially offset by lower revenues per unit  as discussed previously  and higher labor costs resulting from temporary labor  time spent on training and continuous improvement initiatives 
the retail and distribution segment s gross profit loss increased primarily as a result of the following factors impairment of equipment held for lease along with certain loss contingencies recognized related to its leasing activities totaling million and million in and  respectively  improved used trailers margins  which were in compared to in  improved margins from our parts distribution business  and new trailer and aftermarket parts inventory valuation adjustments of approximately million in  partially offset by declines in new trailer and parts and service gross profit  in part due to fewer locations in  and used trailer inventory adjustments of million in general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction of million in bad debt expense representing improved collection efforts and significant write offs taken in the decrease in bad debt expense was offset in part by increases of million in professional fees and million in severance related to branch closings and former corporate employees 
restructuring expense restructuring expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in the expense represented additional fair market value adjustments to closed manufacturing locations which are held for sale related to and restructuring actions 
the expense primarily related to asset write downs for the scott county  tennessee and fort madison  iowa manufacturing facilities and montebello  california parts distribution center taken as part of the restructuring 
other income expense interest expense totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on the company s senior notes and bank debt resulting from the debt restructuring in april  interest on capital leases that were entered into during the fourth quarter of and significantly higher amortization from deferred debt costs in connection with the debt restructuring  offset in part by reduced overall borrowings in trade receivables facility costs related to the company s accounts receivable securitization facility  increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of million in costs incurred with restructuring the facility in april  offset in part by an absence of borrowings under the restructured facility from april to december foreign currency transaction loss  net was million for the year ended december  loss on debt extinguishment of million in represents fees and the write off of deferred debt issuance costs associated with the april debt restructuring 
other  net was income of million in compared to expense of million in the increase primarily includes gains on sales of closed branch locations 
income taxes income tax benefit for and was million and million  respectively 
the effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
for  the benefit recorded primarily represents an additional realizable federal net operating loss nol carry back claim filed and received under the provisions of the job creation and worker assistance act of  which revised the permitted carry back period for nols generated during from two years to five years 
in  the effective rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that the company determined were more likely than not to be realized before expiration 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure today  our capital structure is primarily supported by debt as a result of the significant losses incurred during the years through significant improvements have been made over the last three years and in we were able to stabilize our financial footing through a series of asset sales  branch network reorganization  debt refinancing and the conversion of preferred shares 
these actions  described below  resulted in repayment or refinancing of essentially all of our indebtedness  increased our financial flexibility and substantially reduced the effective rate on borrowings 
our objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to satisfy normal requirements for working capital and capital expenditures and to better balance the mix of debt and equity in our capital structure 
asset sales on september   we completed the sale of certain of the assets of our trailer leasing and rental and aftermarket parts businesses for approximately million in cash 
net proceeds from the sale were used to repay a portion of the company s outstanding indebtedness 
loss on the disposition amounted to million  including a million asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of a large portion of our finance contracts 
proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce outstanding debt 
the sale resulted in a loss of million  including a million debt extinguishment charge 
during  we realized proceeds of approximately million from the sale of branch properties 
branch network reorganization in the third quarter of  we closed retail branch locations and closed our lafayette modification center in the fourth quarter 
we currently operate full service branches  four retail only branches and three used trailer centers 
the closings reduced branch headcount by and yielded an annualized cost savings of approximately million 
we recorded a charge in the third quarter of approximately million in connection with the closings 
debt refinancing on august   we completed the sale of million of five year senior unsecured convertible notes  which are currently convertible into approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
the notes have a conversion price of or a rate of shares per  principal amount of note 
if the notes convert  the number of shares of our common stock outstanding would increase by approximately 
the notes bear interest at per annum payable semi annually on february and august if not converted  the balance will become due on august  costs associated with the transaction amounted to approximately million and are being amortized over the term of the notes 
on september   we entered into a million three year asset based loan arrangement that includes a million term loan bank term loan and a million revolver bank revolver 
the new financing replaced existing indebtedness and is expected to substantially lower our cost of debt as a result of lower interest rates on borrowings 
our current effective interest rate is approximately compared to approximately under our previous borrowing arrangements 
the bank term loan is secured by property  plant and equipment 
the bank revolver is secured by inventory and accounts receivable and the amount available to borrow varies in relation to the balances of those accounts 
interest on the bank term loan is variable  based on the london interbank offer rate libor plus basis points  decreasing to basis points after six months  or the bank s alternative rate  as defined in the agreement 
interest on the bank revolver is at libor plus basis points  decreasing to basis points after six months  or the bank s alternative rate  as defined in the agreement 
we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility at a rate of basis points per annum 
costs associated with the transaction amounted to approximately million and are being amortized over the term of the loan 
the bank term loan requires a million principal payment on january  and quarterly principal payments of million commencing on january   with the balance due on september  the january  payments were made on december  the bank revolver is due on september  beginning in march  excess cash flow  as defined  is required to be used to reduce term loan indebtedness 
the refinancing resulted in debt extinguishment charges of approximately million 
preferred share conversion in december of  we forced the conversion of preferred shares with a redemption value of approximately million into approximately  shares of common stock 
the transaction will save approximately million in annual mandatory dividend payments 
cash flow operating activities provided million in cash during compared to providing million during operating activities for saw further reductions in new and used trailer and work in process inventories  net cash flows from income after adjusting for non cash items and accounts payable timing  offset by increased levels of accounts receivable associated with strong december sales 
the period benefited from reduced accounts receivables  inventories  the collection of tax refunds and accounts payable timing 
accounts receivable  net were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
days sales outstanding dso were approximately in compared to in reflecting strong end of year sales 
inventory balances were reduced approximately million in inventory turns increased to approximately nine in compared to approximately six in investing activities provided million in cash during primarily due to the asset sales discussed previously along with the impact of our decision not to reinvest in our financing and leasing businesses 
net cash used in financing activities of million during was primarily for the repayment of debt from the proceeds of asset sales of million with the remainder coming from operating cash flows and available cash balances 
capital expenditures capital spending amounted to approximately million for and is anticipated to be approximately million for spending is focused on productivity improvement and capacity maintenance 
outlook the industry recovery that began in is expected to accelerate in as production of trailers is anticipated to increase from approximately  units to approximately  units based on act estimates 
the expansion in production is predicated on a number of factors including improving general economic conditions  pent up trucking industry demand for replacement units as the average age of trailer fleets increases and department of transportation regulations regarding driver hours hours of service that may require additional trailers to maintain driver productivity 
we expect to participate in the industry growth because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate r trailer continues to have increased market acceptance and penetration and we are expanding our presence into the middle market carriers approximately  carriers with fleet sizes ranging from to  units 
we believe that wabash is well positioned to benefit from an increased demand for trailers because of the improvements that have been made over the last three years 
as a result of our continuous improvement initiatives  we have reduced the total cost of producing a trailer and effectively increased production capacity 
additionally  we have become much more efficient in the use of working capital 
key to will be our ability to counter the effects of price volatility in our principal raw materials  aluminum  steel  plastic and timber with productivity gains and selective selling price increases 
as of december   our liquidity position  cash on hand and available borrowing capacity amounted to approximately million and debt and lease obligations  both on and off the balance sheet  amounted to approximately million including million not on the balance sheet 
we expect that in  wabash will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund working capital and capital spending requirements and to further reduce indebtedness 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments a summary of payments of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  both on and off balance sheet  as of december  are as follows millions thereafter total debt excluding interest senior convertible notes bank revolver bank term loan other notes payable total debt other currency forward contracts operating leases total other other commercial commitments letters of credit purchase commitments residual guarantees total obligations residual guarantees represent purchase commitments related to certain new and used trailer transactions as well as certain production equipment 
we also have purchase options of million on the aforementioned trailers and equipment 
to the extent that the value of the underlying property is less than the residual guarantee and the value is not expected to be recovered  we have recorded a loss contingency 
purchase commitments primarily represent minimum purchase commitments under a parts purchase agreement we entered into in connection with the sale of certain assets of our aftermarket parts distribution business 
we are required to purchase million in parts over the next three years with a minimum of million per year 
the purchase price for the parts will be at current market prices  will not exceed business requirements and is subject to certain performance requirements 
operating leases represent the total future minimum lease payments for off balance sheet debt 
off balance sheet transactions we had no off balance sheet financing transactions in and as of december   we have operating leases with future minimum lease payments of million  as disclosed in the preceding table 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for wabash s critical accounting estimates critical estimate nature of estimates assumptions balance sheet caption item required approaches used key factors accrued liabilities and warranty estimating warranty requires we base our estimate on historical failure rates and other long term us to forecast the resolution trends of units sold and payment estimated repair liabilities of existing claims and amounts  combined with our current costs expected future claims on understanding of the status of products sold

including by taxing entity in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our inventories would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have a significant impact on our business 
new accounting pronouncements variable interest entities in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin defines a variable interest entity vie as a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure that does not have equity investors with a controlling financial interest or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
the company has evaluated its financial arrangements that had potential fin impact and determined that none of these arrangements are with a vie and that the adoption will have no impact on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or liquidity

customer credit risk we sublease certain highly specialized roadrailer r equipment to grupo transportation marititma mexicana sa tmm  who is experiencing financial difficulties 
due to the nature of the equipment  recovery value is considered to be minimal 
as of december   we have approximately million of leased equipment with tmm recorded as equipment leased to others on the consolidated balance sheets 
the obligation is current and as a result no provision for loss has been recorded 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  the company has exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding the company s exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks the company is exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and virgin plastic pellets 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
the company may manage aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with its suppliers 
as of december   the company had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately million 
because the company typically does not set prices for its products in advance of its commodity purchases  it can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting its prices for each order 
to the extent that the company is unable to offset the increased commodity costs in its product prices  the company s results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   the company had approximately million of floating rate debt outstanding under its various financing agreements 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level would correspond to approximately a million increase in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
c 
foreign exchange rates the company is subject to fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate that impact intercompany transactions between the company and its canadian subsidiary  as well as us denominated transactions between the canadian subsidiaries and unrelated parties 
a five cent change in the canadian exchange rate would result in an approximately million impact on results of operations 
in july  the company began purchasing canadian dollar foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate potential canadian currency fluctuation impact on working capital requirements 
as of december   the company had outstanding million in forward contracts to be settled in various increments over the next seven months 
the contracts are marked to market and not subject to hedge accounting 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
item b risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report before investing in our securities 
realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
risks related to our business  strategy and operations we have not generated profitability in recent periods 
wabash incurred significant net losses during the last three years 
we have reported net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will depend on the successful implementation of measures to reduce costs and achieve sales goals 
while we have taken steps to improve cost performance  lower operating costs and reduce interest expense  and have seen our sales improve in the recent periods  we cannot assure you that our cost reduction measures will be successful  sales will be sustained or increased or that we can achieve a sustained return to profitability 
our inventories are not managed by perpetual inventory control systems 
systems and processes used to manage and value our inventories require significant manual intervention and the verification of actual quantities requires a physical inventory which is taken once a year 
breakdowns of these systems and processes  and errors in inventory estimates derived from these systems and processes could go undetected until the next physical inventory and adversely affect our operations and financial results 
an adverse change in our customer relationships or in the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business 
we have corporate partnering relationships with a number of customers where we supply the requirements of these customers 
our success is dependent  to a significant extent  upon the continued strength of these relationships and the growth of our corporate partners 
we often are unable to predict the level of demand for our products from these partners  or the timing of their orders 
in addition  the same economic condition that adversely affects us also often adversely affects our customers 
as some of our customers are highly leveraged and have limited access to capital  their continued existence may be uncertain 
one of our customers  grupo transportation marititma mexicana sa tmm  located in mexico is experiencing financial difficulties 
although this customer is current in its payment obligation to us  the customer owes us million secured by highly specialized roadrailer r equipment  which due to the nature of the equipment has a minimal recovery value 
the loss of a significant customer or unexpected delays in product purchases could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our technology and products may not achieve market acceptance  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
we continue to introduce new products such as the duraplate r hd  and the freightpro r trailer 
we cannot assure you that these or other new products or technologies will achieve sustained market acceptance 
in addition  new technologies or products that our competitors introduce may render our products obsolete or uncompetitive 
we have taken steps to protect our proprietary rights in our new products 
however  the steps we have taken to protect them may not be sufficient or may not be enforced by a court of law 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  other parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we have a limited number of suppliers of raw materials  an increase in the price of raw materials or the inability to obtain raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components in the manufacturing of truck trailers  such as landing gear  axles  and specialty steel coil used in duraplate r panels 
the loss of our suppliers or their inability to meet our price  quality  quantity and delivery requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
disruption of our manufacturing operations or management information systems would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we manufacture our products at two facilities in lafayette  indiana  with our primary manufacturing facility accounting for approximately of our manufacturing output 
an unexpected disruption in our production at either of these facilities or in our management information systems for any length of time would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 
many of our executive officers  including our ceo william p 
greubel  cfo mark r 
holden  and coo richard j 
giromini  are critical to the management and direction of our business 
our future success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel 
the unexpected loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on the operation of our business  as we may be unable to find suitable management to replace departing executives on a timely basis 
the inability to realize additional cost savings could weaken our competitive position 
if we are unable to continue to successfully implement our program of cost reduction and continuous improvement  we may not realize additional anticipated cost savings  which could weaken our competitive position 
we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we are subject to currency exchange rate risk related to sales through our factory owned retail distribution centers in canada 
for the year ended december   currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of million on our results of operations 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience such benefits or that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
risks particular to the industries in which we operate our business is highly cyclical  which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
the truck trailer manufacturing industry historically has been and is expected to continue to be cyclical  as well as affected by overall economic conditions 
new trailer production for the trailer industry as a whole was approximately  in both and and totaled approximately  in customers historically have replaced trailers in cycles that run from five to twelve years  depending on service and trailer type 
poor economic conditions can adversely affect demand for new trailers and in the past have led to an overall aging of trailer fleets beyond this typical replacement cycle 
our business is likely to continue to be adversely affected unless economic conditions improve 
significant competition in the industries in which we operate may result in our competitors offering new or better products and services or lower prices  which could result in a loss of customers and a decrease in our revenues 
the truck trailer manufacturing industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other manufacturers of varying sizes  some of which may have greater financial resources than we do 
barriers to entry in the standard truck trailer manufacturing industry are low 
as a result  it is possible that additional competitors could enter the market at any time 
in addition  we believe that the manufacturing over capacity and high leverage of some of our competitors  along with the recent bankruptcies and financial stresses that have affected the industry  have contributed to significant pricing pressures 
if we are unable to compete successfully with other trailer manufacturers  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
in addition  competitive pressures in the industry may affect the market prices of our new and used equipment  which  in turn  may adversely affect our sales margins and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations  and our costs related to compliance with  or our failure to comply with  existing or future laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the length  height  width  maximum weight capacity and other specifications of truck trailers are regulated by individual states 
the federal government also regulates certain truck trailer safety features  such as lamps  reflective devices  tires  air brake systems  and rear impact guards 
changes or anticipation of changes in these regulations can have a material impact on our financial results  as our customers may defer customer purchasing decisions and we may have to reengineer products 
in addition  we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation  storage  presence  use  disposal and handling of hazardous materials  discharge of storm water and underground fuel storage tanks  and may be subject to liability associated with operations of prior owners of acquired property 
if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our costs of complying with these or any other current or future environmental regulations may be significant 
in addition  if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions 
a decline in the value of used trailers could adversely affect our results of operations 
general economic and industry conditions  as well as the supply of used trailers  influence the value of used trailers 
as part of our normal business practices  we maintain used trailer inventories and have entered into finance contracts secured by used trailers  as well as residual guarantees and purchase commitments for used trailers 
declines in the market value for used trailers or the need to dispose of excess inventories has had  and could in the future have  an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our substantial indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt in relation to our shareholders equity 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of outstanding indebtedness 
although our recent sale in of our unsecured convertible senior notes due august   and the completion of a three year million asset based debt refinancing strengthen our balance sheet  we continue to be highly leveraged 
our high level of debt could have important consequences to our investors  including we may not be able to secure additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or general corporate purposes  we will need to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal of and interest on our debt  which will reduce the amount of funds available to us for other purposes  we may be more highly leveraged than our competitors  which could put us at a competitive disadvantage  and we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  which may make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic condition of our business 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments could limit our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks 
the agreements governing our indebtedness include certain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends on our equity or repurchase our equity  make certain investments  create certain liens  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
our ability to comply with such agreements may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
in addition  upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt agreements  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
risks related to an investment in our securities our common stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  price volatility and a low trading volume 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations and  therefore  the trading price of the notes may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses to investors 
our stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors  including trends in our industry and the markets in which we operate  changes in the market price of the products we sell  the introduction of new technologies or products by us or our competitors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  financings or capital commitments  changes in laws and regulations  and general economic and competitive conditions 
this volatility may adversely affect the prices of our common stock and the convertible senior notes notes regardless of our operating performance 
the price of our common stock also may be adversely affected by the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
assuming million in aggregate principal amount of the notes are converted at a conversion price of  the number of shares of our common stock outstanding would increase by approximately  shares  or approximately 
in addition  our common stock has experienced low trading volume in the past

accordingly  there can be no assurance that any market for the notes will be maintained

the notes are traded on the portal market  however  we do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange 
the liquidity of the trading market in these notes  and the market price quoted for these notes  may be materially adversely affected by changes in the overall market for convertible subordinated securities  changes in our financial performance or prospects  the prospects for companies in our industry generally  the number of holders of the notes  the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes  and prevailing interest rates
